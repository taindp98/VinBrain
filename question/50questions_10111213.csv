1,10,what is the  related between stroke and another diseases ?,"Many of the risks for stroke are linked together — one condition aggravates or causes another, like dominoes in your vascular system
High blood pressure puts more wear and tear on blood vessels and seems to worsen atherosclero- sis, probably because the plaque formation has something to do with the healing process that occurs when the lining of an artery is injured
Atherosclerosis is further aggravated by diabetes
High blood glucose levels seem to lead to injuries in the blood vessels
Diabetes also injures the heart muscles, resulting in more sources of clots to break loose and injure the brain."
2,10,could you tell me about risk factors of stroke ?,"Family history
Age
Gender
Race
Previous stroke
Hypertension
High blood lipids and cholesterol
Heart and vascular disease
Smoking tobacco
Diabetes
Obesity
Oral contraceptives and estrogen replacement
Drug and alcohol abuse"
3,10,how can I classify risk factors of stroke ?,"Some risks factors you can’t control
Other risks are treatable or preventable."
4,10,could you help me define what is the hypertension ?,"High blood pressure, the most important factor deter-
mining the likelihood that you will have a stroke"
5,10,how bad for me is smoking tobacco ?,"Smoking is the biggest preventable cause of death in the United States
In the U.S., roughly 440,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses
Treating the effects of smoking puts a chokehold on our nation’s health costs — we’re talking in the range of $70 billion per year
And yet each day nearly 4,000 young people under the age of 18 light up for the first time, according to some esti- mates."
6,10,what is the  related between stroke and blood diseases ?,"These sub- stances cause blood vessels to constrict (there goes your blood pressure!), reduce oxygen (forcing the heart to work harder), scrape the inside of the blood vessels (forming plaques), and make blood “stickier” (leading to more vessel damage and paving the way for atherosclerosis and clots)."
7,10,could you help me compare affect between smokers and non smokers ?,"Your risk of having a stroke is about 30 percent
more than a nonsmoker who doesn’t inhale someone else’s smoke."
8,10,how can I plan of action to stop smoking ?,"The plan of action to reduce stroke risk caused by smoking is: Stop! There are programs to help you stop smoking
There are approved drugs to help you get over your dependence on nicotine
If you smoke, then chances are very good that you’ve tried to stop
The pain of stopping is immediate and the benefits seem a little vague when you are in withdrawal
You need to find what is motivating you to smoke and tackle that."
9,10,what kind of approaches to stopping smoking ?,"There are quite a few approaches to stopping smoking, including structured programs that offer various tools for quitting, including medication, psycho- logical support, group support, and behavior-modification techniques."
10,10,what is benefits if I stop smoking ?,"Good evidence supports that stopping smoking will reduce your risk of stroke, even if you have been smok- ing for decades or have had one or more strokes
The benefits of breathing better, not coughing as much, and not getting as many infections are always immediate and increase your health and well-being."
11,10,what is related between stroke and heart vascular diseases ?,"If you have had a stroke, you are more likely to have a heart attack in the future
Once again, we see how interrelated the heart and the brain are to each other
The reasons and level of risk vary based on the type of heart dis- ease
Several heart diseases are connected to stroke because heart disease produces conditions that increase blood clotting, which results in stroke
Treatment almost always includes some medication to slow blood clotting."
12,10,why heart valve disease is relate with stroke ? ,"If you have a mechanical (artificial) valve, your risk for stroke is significantly increased
If you do have a stroke, it is critical to communicate and coordinate your care between your heart specialist (cardiologist) and your stroke special- ist
First, because you are undoubtedly on an anticlotting medication — possi- bly warfarin
But it may be at a different dosage than required for your stroke condition
Your clotting control will have to be reevaluated after the stroke, and your medication may need adjustment
Additionally, the valve itself must be checked."
13,10,what is drugs to preventing blood clot ?,"Aspirin
Warfarin"
14,10,what is disease if I have several symptoms such as bleeding in the stomach or intestines ? ,"If your blood is too thin and doesn’t clot well, you could be at high risk for brain bleeding — red stroke."
15,10,what is advantages and disadvantages of warfarin ?,"Warfarin, also known as Coumadin, prevents clots by depriving the body of vitamin K, a substance in green leafy vegetables that helps blood clot.
But taking too much warfarin can cause widespread severe bleeding. 
It is critical to monitor the dosage of warfarin carefully in order not to shift the balance from preventing the risk of white stroke to increasing the risk of red stroke."
16,10,how can I know the dose of warfarin fitting for me ?,"The blood test that measures the time it takes for your blood to clot is called the prothrombin time or protime (PT)
PT is the key to fitting your dose of war- farin to your needs
The results of the PT test are given as a ratio, which can be thought of as the relative time it takes the blood to clot
The technical term for the ratio is the International Normalized Ratio (INR)
If the INR is three, then it takes, roughly, three times as long as normal for your blood to clot
If the INR is 1.5, then bleeding from a cut that normally would stop on its own in five minutes would take 7 or 8 minutes to stop."
17,10,what should I do if I was diagnosis have a stroke ?,"You should be proactive in supporting a positive treatment experience
Here are some steps you can take to help your doctor achieve the optimal pre- scription for you: 
Take your medicine the same time every day and eat similar meals to the extent possible
The best time to take warfarin is before dinner
Consider how often and how consistently you eat leafy green vegetables
They are good for you, but they provide a lot of vitamin K, which counter- acts the effect of warfarin
Eating a lot of leafy greens one day, then none for the next few days can make it hard to get consistent INR readings
Adhere to your dosage instructions
The usual dose of warfarin is between 2 and 5 milligrams once per day
Making a commitment to taking the drug requires diligence on your part
If you forget to take your meds or the right dosage, then warfarin is not for you
Better to take aspirin, which doesn’t need to be monitored so carefully
Watch for signs of bleeding (check your gums after brushing your teeth) and bruising
Be sure to make your appointments for checking the PT time to keep your blood from getting “too thin.” If you need a dosage adjustment, better to make it sooner rather than later."
18,10,could you tell me about heart failure ?,"Every time a healthy heart beats, it squeezes out about 55 percent of the blood in the largest chamber of the heart (the left ventri- cle)
If you have heart failure, your heart only manages to get out 40 percent or less
When this happens, fluid can build up around the ankles and in the lungs, making it more difficult for you to walk and to breathe
Other symptoms you might have are coughing, waking up at night short of breath, and chronic fatigue."
19,10,what is the diabetes ?,"In a nutshell, diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce or use insulin properly. 
Diabetes can lead to cataracts in your eyes, decreased vision because of injuries to the retina, kidney disease, and nerve damage."
20,10,what does diabetes have to do with stroke ?,"Diabetes makes blood vessels more prone to injury
It is as if diabetic arteries do not endure the wear and tear of life as well as nondiabetic arteries
The effects of major risk factors for stroke — atherosclerosis and high blood pressure — are increased in diabet- ics
See the domino effect here? A case of multiple-risk factors conspiring to set you on the path to stroke."
21,10,why i am gaining weight ?,The amount of weight you gain is equal to the difference between the amount of energy you consume and the amount of energy you expend.
22,10,how should I do to lose my weight ?,"You lose weight by a combination of two strategies: First, you exercise more to build muscle mass and burn energy from fat reserves
The greater muscle mass is always burning glucose, even when you are resting
Just like your brain
Second, you consume less energy
Energy is measured in calories
Calories come from food"
23,10,how can I diagnosis whether or not I have had a stroke ?,"Blood-pressure tracking
EKG reading
Cholesterol level
Diabetes testing
Other tests
Ultrasound for atherosclerosis
Chest X-ray
CT or MRI scan"
24,10,could you tell me about diagnosis methods for stroke ? ,"Blood-pressure tracking
EKG reading
Cholesterol level
Diabetes testing
Other tests
Ultrasound for atherosclerosis
Chest X-ray
CT or MRI scan"
25,11,what does a stroke feel like ?,"The word stroke means a sudden or swift action — a golf stroke, a stroke of luck, the stroke of a pen
Stroke, the disease, is also sudden — and requires a swift response
When you have a stroke, you suffer a sudden loss of part of your brain function
You’re normal one moment and suddenly very different only a minute or two later
Usually there is no pain associated with a stroke
Now, that’s not true 100 percent of the time
Sharp neck pain or very severe headache may be present with a few strokes
But specific symptoms indicate that something is sud- denly and clearly amiss with the brain
The key concepts bound together by the word stroke are"
26,11,what if I am incapacitated ?,"If you experience loss of feeling or paralysis or cannot speak or find yourself in a state of confusion, you may not be able to seek help. 
You may have to rely on family members, friends, or even strangers to call for emergency help."
27,11,what to do if someone is having a stroke ?,"When someone is having a stroke, you will notice some peculiar behavior immediately: The mouth may droop on one side of the face, as if the face is slack on that side. 
This droop is often accompanied by slurred speech. 
Talking becomes a struggle — often the sufferer can only get out a word or two and then becomes mute."
28,11,what happens after a stroke to my heart/brain/blood ?,"With stroke, the heart is not affected and continues beating. Partial blood flow continues, and the brain can survive longer — but every minute still counts."
29,11,what level of emergency for stroke ?,"Stroke is a major emergency. 
It’s the brain! 
Because the stroke patient may not be in a position to speak up, it may be up to the family member or friend to make sure the individual is given the attention he or she needs."
30,11,what is the “golder hour” of stroke victim ?,"For the stroke victim, the race against time continues in the emergency department
The next hour is called the “golden hour” because during that time the opportunity is greatest to prevent or limit permanent damage
Don’t expect the doctors to stop and spend 20 minutes talking to the family
This is not the time
Brain is dying and the stroke response team must focus every minute on determining the cause of the stroke to treat as quickly as possible."
31,11,how many main types of stroke ?,"Acute ischemic stroke
Transient ischemic stroke
Intracerebral hemorrhage
Subarachnoid hemorrhage"
32,11,how many types of white stroke and treating it ?,"There are two types of white strokes (the blood-clotting kind): the acute ischemic stroke and the transient ischemic stroke.
With the first kind, the doctors want to re-open the plugged vessel by dissolving the blood clot and restoring blood flow quickly before the brain is permanently injured."
33,11,how can the doctor treats white strokes ?,"The treatment that does that job is tissue plasminogen activator, better known as TPA — the only FDA-approved treatment for white strokes."
34,11,who can benefit from TPA to treat white stroke ?,"The stroke causes significant disability and is not considered a minor stroke
The stroke is not rapidly improving
The symptoms of stroke should not be suggestive of bleeding from a ruptured aneurysm (SAH stroke)
The stroke onset is less than three hours before beginning treatment
No major head injury or prior stroke in previous three months
No heart attack in previous three months
No bleeding from the stomach, bowels, kidneys, or bladder in the previ- ous 21 days
No major surgery in previous 14 days
No history of previous intracranial hemorrhage
Blood pressure not elevated (systolic should be less than 185, diastolic less than 110)
No evidence of active bleeding or recent injury causing a fracture
The blood should clot normally
Blood glucose concentration must not be excessively elevated."
35,11,what severe of red strokes ?,"The red stroke known as intracerebral hemorrhage — or ICH — is caused by bleeding within the brain. 
ICH is a very deadly form of stroke. 
Severe brain bleeding stops the patient from breathing and requires that tough decisions be made."
36,11,what should the doctor do for treating red stroke ?,"The goal of treatment is to stop the bleeding as soon as possible. 
Unfortunately, very little can be done other than lowering excessively high blood pressure, which has to be performed very carefully. 
Actions can be taken to help reduce brain swelling if that is a problem. 
A neurosurgeon may be called to evaluate the patient. 
Sometimes the blood inside the brain can be removed, and the patient does well, but the general rule is that surgery doesn’t make that much difference. 
You have to trust the surgeon’s judgment on this tough decision."
37,12,how could I do  for reducing the risk of another white stroke ?,"Four critical steps can help prevent a second white stroke:
Take a drug to slow down your blood clotting.
Have carotid endarterectomy to check for blockage.
Learn the signs and symptoms of stroke so you can get to the emergency department faster in the future.
Control your high blood pressure better, get your cholesterol down, stop smoking, and control diabetes."
38,12,why I need to check my heart when I have a white stroke ?,"If you’ve had a white (ischemic) stroke (or a red — intracerebral — stroke, for that matter), you don’t just have high risk of another stroke. 
You also have high risk of heart disease. 
An exam by a cardiologist during your hospital stay is critical in determining the status of your heart and blood vessels. 
An electrocardiogram (EKG) is an easy and virtually pain-free test. 
The suction cups some doctors still use on your chest wall may leave bruises, but besides that, the test is just another small event in the complex day of the recovering stroke patient."
39,12,how to preventing future red strokes ?,"High blood pressure is the most common cause of intracerebral (ICH) red strokes — those that bleed within the brain. 
If you are over 50 or 55 and have high blood pressure, the cause of your stroke is usually just that. 
If you are especially young and do not have high blood pressure or another reason that explains your red stroke, then further tests may be conducted.
A cerebral angiogram is a likely procedure to be scheduled. 
MRI scans might pick up the presence of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and some other abnormali- ties of blood vessels."
40,12,how to avoiding further red strokes ?,"You prevent the recurrence of bleeding from brain aneurysms by either clip- ping them off from outside through the skull (a big deal) or by coiling them off from the inside (still a big deal, but perhaps a little safer). 
Before such surgery, doctors are likely to run a series of MRI studies and an angiogram to accurately locate the aneurysm. 
Sometimes it’s hard to tell which aneurysm actually did the bleeding when two or more are found."
41,12,why I have the brain swelling ?,"Brain swelling is a very serious complication of stroke and can occur for a number of reasons. 
If you have a white stroke, the brain area injured by a lack of blood will begin to swell. 
In red stroke, the brain swells because of the extra blood from the bleeding. 
In addition, the blood can block the flow of fluid in the ventricles and the backed-up fluid expands the brain. 
Finally, any blood inside the substance of the brain causes inflammation and swelling."
42,12,what is the antiseizure medications ?,"Seizures are usually treatable and typically do not happen again if anti- seizure medications are started. 
Several medications are available, including ophenytoin (Dilantin) and carbamazepine (Tegretol). 
If you have a seizure in the hospital, your family should call for help. 
In the meantime, they can turn you on one side or the other to prevent you from inhaling into your lungs any saliva or vomitus in your mouth."
43,12,how leg clots are a risk ?,"The blood in your leg veins is moved along slowly toward the heart in part by the gentle squeezing whenever you contract the leg muscles. 
The veins have tough but thin walls that are easily squeezed by muscles. 
They are likewise easily distended by blood seeping into them from the tiny capillaries that connect to arteries."
44,12,when clots hit the lungs ?,"If the clot is small enough to pass through the right side of the heart without causing damage, its next stop, as it transfers to the outgoing transportation system — the arteries — is the lungs. 
Small clots block only small bits of lung, and blood flows through alternate pathways."
45,12,how should I do for preventing blood clots in the legs ?,"Obviously, the best thing to do is to keep the clots from forming in the veins in the first place. 
Shifting your position stirs the blood and moves it toward the heart, keeping it from forming blood clots."
46,12,what do I need in hospital after stroke ?,"These steps will help you optimize your hospital experience: Take advantage: The hospital staff is there to help you plan for after you leave the hospital. 
They have a lot of experience with stroke patients — welcome their input and seek out their advice and knowledge. 
Work hard: I’ve said it in earlier chapters, but the sooner you start ther- apy, the better your odds for recovery. 
Cooperate with the hospital therapists to develop a post-hospital plan and learn as much as you can about becoming as independent as possible. 
Observe: Watch how the nurses take care of you. 
You and your care- taker can start practicing some of what you learn — whether it’s tips for getting out of bed into a chair or strategies for bathing. 
Gather — and give — information: Keep a list of tests done and their results, drugs prescribed, and all the medical issues that have arisen. 
Be sure that the physicians caring for you know your prestroke medical his- tory. 
Doctors often don’t have access to all your old records, and even if they did, may not take time to dig through them. 
Plan with your family: Anticipate the daily and weekly schedule after you return home. 
Talk about the help you’ll need and how you’ll get it. Set up a schedule. Make arrangements. 
You have much to gain by launching a strong plan for dealing with the challenges of the future."
47,13,how is the life in rehabilitation center ?,"The term rehab may conjure up images of celebrities escaping to luxurious private facilities where they lounge around landscaped grounds, wear designer robes, and dine on gourmet fare prepared by famous chefs. 
In truth, a rehabilitation center is not a place where the stroke survivor is pampered and waited on hand and foot. Instead of spa resort, think back-to-school. 
Yes, the rehabilitation center is more of an educational institution offering a crash course in skills that will help the stroke victim regain independence and lead a fuller life."
48,13,who should gop to rehab ?,"The answer depends on many different factors: doctor recommendation, severity of stroke and the damage incurred, level of care that can be provided in the home, and, no less impor- tant, the attitude and openness of the stroke patient and the family toward the rehab experience."
49,13,how much rehabilitation is needed ?,"Most stroke patients who go into a rehab center stay for weeks — not months. 
Though many have told me later that they wished they could have stayed longer. 
But each stroke patient is unique and, consequently, will follow different programs with different time requirements."
50,13,why can’t I have rehab in my own home ?,"Of course, with unlimited resources, you can turn your home into a rehabilitation center and have the appropriate specialists come to you. 
However, this turns out to be very difficult. 
Scheduling difficulties, space limitations, and lack of equipment may be a few challenges. 
Even more critical, you’d miss out on the interac- tion with other patients and families in the same predicament."
