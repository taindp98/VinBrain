0,"The most common sign of blood-vessel damage is atherosclerosis, also known as hardening of the arteries, the condition in which a rough, scarred area called a plaque forms because of high blood pressure and high fat content in your blood",TAI,What are the most common signs of vascular damage?,1
1,"White ischemic strokes are also caused by dissection. Dissection refers to the splitting
of the blood vessel lining, typically occurring at a place where the blood
vessel bends back and forth, such as in your neck. It can also happen where
atherosclerotic plaque has built up in a brain artery. At the bend point or at the
rough surface of atherosclerosis, a little flap of the vessel lining peels off and
catches the blood as it flows quickly past. The blood dives under the flap and
keeps tearing it. Eventually the blood can pack the lining against the other
side of the vessel and stop blood flow completely. When the blood stops flowing, a white stroke occurs. ",TAI,What causes white ischemic stroke?,1
2,"White ischemic strokes may last just a couple of minutes and then clear completely. If the blood clot breaks up right away, the stroke is transient — so fleeting that no permanent tissue death occurred. These transient strokes are officially called transient ischemic attacks. Doctors abbreviate it as TIA",TAI,What is TIA?,1
3,"when have more than one transient ischemic stroke. As the number of these small strokes add up, your brain can just slow down generally, and you can suffer from dementia, as each small stroke erodes away more of your brain. ",TAI,What is vascular demetia?,1
4,A stroke caused by a blood vessel that breaks inside the substance of the brain is called brain bleeding. The brain goes from pink to red.,TAI,What is brain bleeding?,1

18,"The CT scan, the most common scan used on the brain, involves X-rays, using about the same amount of radiation as a chest X-ray",TAI,What is CT scan?,2
19,CT stands for computerized tomography. A CT scan is also called a CAT scan. CAT stands for computerized axial tomography,TAI,What other names does CT scan have?,2
20,"To have a CT scan of your head, you are placed on a large, movable table, and your head is positioned in the middle of a futuristic-looking metal-and-plastic donut. X-rays are taken from many different angles as the emitter orbits around your head. In about five minutes, the scan process is completed. A computer constructs an image of the brain inside the skull by adding together all the information.",TAI,CT scan procedure like?,2
21,"The magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scan can look a lot like the CT scan, but it uses magnetism and radio waves instead of X-rays to form images",TAI,Could you tell me what is MRI?,2
22,"The result is a much more detailed picture of the brain than a CT scan provides. However, An MRI scan takes longer to perform and requires the patient to hold still in a very confined space.",TAI,What are the benefits of an MRI scan over a CT scan,2
23,"A positron emission tomography, or PET, scan can actually show the chemical activity of the brain via the introduction of special radioactive compounds into the brain. The result is in color, but are not as detailed as CT and MRI scans. For the present time, PET scans are for research purpose.",TAI,Can you tell me about PET scan?,2
24,Infarction is the process of cells dying because of insufficient blood flow,TAI,What is Infarction?,3
25,"High blood pressure, Fat and atherosclerosis, Smoking tobacco, Atrial fibrillation, Estrogen: Pregnancy, the pill, and
hormone-replacement supplements and other risks are risk factor of white stroke",TAI,What are the risk factors of white stroke?,3
26,Estrogen is a hormone that occurs naturally in women,TAI,"I don'n know Estrogen, what is it?",3
27,"Estrogen levels are especially high in pregnancy, when it is a good idea to be able to clot and prevent excessive bleeding. Many women also take estrogen orally in birth control pills or in hormone-replacement supplements during menopause. However, this is increase the occurrence of blood clots.",TAI,Why does Estrogen lead to white stroke?,3
28,"So now you know that white ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot blocking an artery to the brain. Either the flow is completely or partially cut off to some portion of the brain that depends primarily on that artery for blood. As time passes, brain cells in the affected region stop their usual function as they run out of oxygen. After a short time, if blood flow is not restored, the brain cells are not able to keep up with their basic needs for survival. When this happens, the cells begin to die, and their cell walls begin to break down. For a while, the brain can hold its breath. Some cells in the brain can survive longer without oxygen than others. Some can steal enough oxygen from nearby blood vessels that are still flowing to keep themselves alive. However, others start dying within minutes of the first deprivation of blood. Most of the cells die within three to four hours.",TAI,How White Stroke Injures the Brain,3
29,"Big strokes: Blocking a major artery, Medium stroke: Blocking branches

31,Dissolving the clot is the most likely method of treating white strokes at the moment.,TAI,What white stroke treatments are there?,3
32,"FDA treatment is TPA (tissue plasminogen activator), a drug that dissolves the blood clot that is blocking a brain artery and causing ischemia in part of the brain. If TPA is given early three hours or less after the first
symptoms of your stroke the blood clot may be dissolved, and blood flow
re-established soon enough to reduce the amount of injury to the brain.",TAI,What is FDA treatment?,3
33,"It is called TIA. This is type of stoke that take place in a short time. It’s over in minutes and you’re back to normal.Your arms and legs work fine, you walk without a limp, your speech returns,

35,"Most strokes are painless, and the symptoms, a paralyzed arm or leg for instance, are not obviously related to the brain.",TAI,What are symp of stroke?,1
36,a brain attack strikes its victims quickly and powerfully and without warning.,TAI,How does stroke occurs?,1
37,"Although your stroke may occur in a lightning flash, it has most likely been years in the making, with conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes possibly serving as warning signs that the brain is in danger. Basically, as these conditions cause wear and tear on your blood vessels, your risks increase of suffering either a blockage or rupture of a brain artery",TAI,What are risk factors of stroke?,1
38,"the glucose and oxygen transported by one of the brain’s arteries are not reaching some part of the brain, which in less than a minute will begin to shut down. And you will show signs of stroke",TAI,Why does stroke occurs?,1
39,"The 50 professional groups forming the Brain Attack Coalition describe the signs of stroke as follows: Sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one
side of the body; Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech; Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination; Sudden severe headache with no known cause",TAI,"Could you tell me, what are signs of stroke?",1
40,"Suppose a small blood clot forms in your heart and flows with the blood up into your brain and plugs an artery that feeds a part of your brain near the top of your head. Normally, that part of the brain sends nerve impulses down threadlike fibers through the base of your brain and along your spinal cord down to a point a couple of inches below your lowest rib. There those nerve fibers connect to other nerve fibers that extend down to muscles in your legs. But without blood flow, the affected part of the brain stops sending messages. when you lose control.",TAI,why is it that a blocked artery in brain causes I to lose control,1
41,Most other cells in the body can survive for up to an hour without blood flow. The brain cells stop working in a matter of seconds and start dying after five minutes,TAI,Why does a stroke last for a few minutes can lead to a major injury?,1
42,"Sometimes, with severe headache, for example, it’s hard to tell whether a stroke is happening at all because the symptoms are similar to those of a migraine headache. A stroke might cause dizziness that is difficult to distinguish from an inner-ear infection. Fortunately, testing instruments such as CT or MRI scans can indicate if there is a stroke and what its cause might be.",TAI,How to recognize Stroke?,1
43,"Some strokes are caused by broken blood vessels which results in blood in the brain or brain area (thus, the red); other strokes are caused by the blockage of vessels to the brain, so no blood gets there (hence, white).",TAI,What are main type of stroke?,1
44,"If the clot blocks blood to a part of your brain, you have a stroke. If the clot stays in place for even a short time, part of your brain dies, leaving a hole called a brain infarction. The affected area of brain turns from pink to white because there is no red blood flowing (another good reason to refer to this type of stroke as white).",TAI,Why do white stroke call white?,1
45,"Sometimes it's called white stroke. Because, If the clot blocks blood to a part of your brain, you have a stroke. If the clot stays in place for even a short time, part of your brain dies, leaving a hole called a brain infarction. The affected area of brain turns from pink to white because there is no red blood flowing",TAI,What is brain infarction?,1
46,White ischemic strokes can turn red if a blood vessel is injured and breaks in the area where lack of blood flow caused a brain infarction. The bleeding can become a major intracranial hemorrhage or it may just be a small leak that doesn’t do much more damage than has already been done by the ischemia.,TAI,When red and white stroke occur together,1
47,"High blood pressure particularly longstanding high blood pressure is the leading cause of brain hemorrhages, being responsible for nearly half. Still, that leaves many other possible causes. Unlike white stroke, which is almost always caused by blood clots blocking arteries and reduced blood flow, brain hemorrhage may be the result of anything from abnormal blood vessels to a bladder infection.",TAI,Why the brain bleed?,5
48,White ischemic strokes can turn red if a blood vessel is injured and breaks in the area where lack of blood flow caused a brain infarction. The bleeding can become a major intracranial hemorrhage or it may just be a small leak that doesn’t do much more damage than has already been done by the ischemia.,TAI,When does a white stroke change to a red stroke?,5
49,"One of the most common blood-vessel abnormalities, arteriovenous malformations or AVMs, are formed from brain arteries and veins. Brain bleeding from AVMs is generally not as severe as the more common type of brain hemorrhage from a broken artery. High blood pressure increases the risk that an AVM will bleed, but they often bleed when the blood pressure is normal.",TAI,What is AVMs?,5
50,"Many of the risks for stroke are linked together one condition aggravates or causes another, like dominoes in your vascular system
High blood pressure puts more wear and tear on blood vessels and seems to worsen atherosclerosis, probably because the plaque formation has something to do with the healing process that occurs when the lining of an artery is injured
Atherosclerosis is further aggravated by diabetes
High blood glucose levels seem to lead to injuries in the blood vessels
Diabetes also injures the heart muscles, resulting in more sources of clots to break loose and injure the brain.",VU,what is the  related between stroke and another diseases ?,10

64,"Warfarin, also known as Coumadin, prevents clots by depriving the body of vitamin K, a substance in green leafy vegetables that helps blood clot.
But taking too much warfarin can cause widespread severe bleeding. 
It is critical to monitor the dosage of warfarin carefully in order not to shift the balance from preventing the risk of white stroke to increasing the risk of red stroke.",VU,what is advantages and disadvantages of warfarin ?,10
65,"The blood test that measures the time it takes for your blood to clot is called the prothrombin time or protime (PT)
PT is the key to fitting your dose of warfarin to your needs
The results of the PT test are given as a ratio, which can be thought of as the relative time it takes the blood to clot
The technical term for the ratio is the International Normalized Ratio (INR)
If the INR is three, then it takes, roughly, three times as long as normal for your blood to clot
If the INR is 1.5, then bleeding from a cut that normally would stop on its own in five minutes would take 7 or 8 minutes to stop.",VU,how can I know the dose of warfarin fitting for me ?,10
66,"You should be proactive in supporting a positive treatment experience
Here are some steps you can take to help your doctor achieve the optimal pre- scription for you: 
Take your medicine the same time every day and eat similar meals to the extent possible
The best time to take warfarin is before dinner
Consider how often and how consistently you eat leafy green vegetables
They are good for you, but they provide a lot of vitamin K, which counter- acts the effect of warfarin
Eating a lot of leafy greens one day, then none for the next few days can make it hard to get consistent INR readings
Adhere to your dosage instructions
The usual dose of warfarin is between 2 and 5 milligrams once per day
Making a commitment to taking the drug requires diligence on your part
If you forget to take your meds or the right dosage, then warfarin is not for you
Better to take aspirin, which doesn’t need to be monitored so carefully
Watch for signs of bleeding (check your gums after brushing your teeth) and bruising
Be sure to make your appointments for checking the PT time to keep your blood from getting “too thin.” If you need a dosage adjustment, better to make it sooner rather than later.",VU,what should I do if I was diagnosis have a stroke ?,10

Work hard: I’ve said it in earlier chapters, but the sooner you start ther- apy, the better your odds for recovery. 
Cooperate with the hospital therapists to develop a post-hospital plan and learn as much as you can about becoming as independent as possible. 
Observe: Watch how the nurses take care of you. 
You and your care- taker can start practicing some of what you learn whether it’s tips for getting out of bed into a chair or strategies for bathing. 
Gather and give information: Keep a list of tests done and their results, drugs prescribed, and all the medical issues that have arisen. 
Be sure that the physicians caring for you know your prestroke medical history. 
Doctors often don’t have access to all your old records, and even if they did, may not take time to dig through them.
