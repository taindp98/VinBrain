{"_id": "70834ebb", "question": "What are the leading risk factors for having a stroke?", "answers": "If you can answer this in a Quora answer, I’d say you deserve the Nobel’s Prize in Medicine!\nIn some cases, it’s obvious what caused a stroke: if somebody’s obese, has really high blood pressure, is really old, etc., it’s pretty clear-cut.\nBut I was 115 pounds, 90/60, and 24 years old when I had my stroke. My doctors looked at me, referred me to a cardiologist for another test, which was negative, and told me to go on my way. “The chance of you having a subsequent stroke is very small,” they assured me.\nSix months later, I was back in the hospital with another one. =(\nAbout six months after THAT, I was able to peer out from beneath my lead jacket of fatigue and pick my head up enough to wonder WHY I’d had a second one. It’d be nice to figure it out, I wagered, to prevent a third one. At that point, I’d already decided that if I had another one, JUST LET ME DIE.\nMy speech therapist referred me to a neurologist at the big city hospital nearby. In retrospect, he was nuts, but he did decide to perform a test just to check for certain that the cardiologist I’d originally seen hadn’t missed anything. (The first test, a TEE — trans esophageal echocardiogram — checked for a hole in my heart by sticking a camera down my throat look to look at my heart. The second test, a TCD — transcranial doppler — shot minuscule bubbles into my arm via an IV and listened to my brain to see if any of them made it up there.) Lo and behold, it dinged! I had a hole in my heart that allowed bubbles/clots/etc to pass through a ventricle and into my brain.\nBut, a week later, the neurologist called and said he wasn’t sure that the hole was the cause of my stroked. He explained that doctors usually require both a hole and a hypercoagulable disease — i.e. you need a hole in your heart and a reason to have a clot. “Why the h*ll did you have me do this test, then?” I wanted to shout.\nTo make a long story short, I decided to go ahead and have surgery to close the hole. It’s not terribly risky, but it is heart surgery. I haven’t had another stroke in 12 years, I’ve had a very good neurologist tell me that clots sometimes form in the area right around the hole *just because*, I’ve had doctors tell me to get my head screwed on straight — everybody knows a hole isnt enough without a hypercoagulable disease … I’ve pretty much just given up having any chance of ever knowing what caused my strokes.\nSo please, figure it out!

{"_id": "a5877bc6", "question": "How can I prevent myself from having a stroke?", "answers": "Currently, we have no Heimlich maneuver for CVA, other than a substance called TPA, which is injected into the bloodstream and causes any clots to break apart, thus opening any blocked vesicles in the brain. BUT— and it’s a big but—\nCVAs can be caused by clots (ischemic), yessireee, but they can also be caused by bleeds (hemorrhagic). If you have a bleed in your brain causing symptoms of stroke, and you just happen to have some TPA laying around, and you just happen to still be capable of injecting said TPA into your vein to break up a clot you think you have, do you know what happens? The bleed in your brain bleeds faster, and you could bleed out, because TPA works on clots, not bleeds.\nSo, you’re having stroke symptoms- sided weakness, some pins-and-needles, confusion- is it being caused by a clot or a bleed? Quickly now- guess correctly and quickly, you want to stop this immediately, remember?\nBzzzzzzt! Time’s up and guess what, you can’t know without a CT scan. What? You don’t have a CT scanner at your house? Well now what?! How are you going to stop this immediately without a CT scanner?\nYou are going to call 911 or whatever your emergency services number is, and let trained, qualified medical professionals do their job and get your clogged or bleeding brain to a hospital as fast as they can. Time is brain functioning in a stroke; we have stretched the golden hour to the golden three hours, but less than one hour is still best.\nYou will be immediately evaluated while in the ambulance and wheeled directly to radiology for that CT scan. The scan will be read by a neurologist who will determine if there is a bleed- no bleed, you’ll be offered TPA. You say yes, the nurse adds a small bag of clear fluid to your IV. Within minutes, you start to feel less confused, not so groggy. Every minute after that, you ‘clear’ a bit more. You may come all the way back in a matter of hours, there may always be some residual damage, you won’t know until you are on your individual journey.\nIf the scan showed a bleed, you will be whisked into surgery and the bleed will be stopped if possible- if accessible. Sometimes a transfusion of clotting factors can be given if the bleed cannot be reached. Then, of course, care must be taken there’s not a clot in the brain, too. You may come all the way back in a matter of hours, there may always be some residual damage, you won’t know until you are on your individual journey.\nBut, that is the best we have right now, and it is far and away better than what we had even a quarter century ago. Thank your lucky stars."}
{"_id": "21df3f64", "question": "Why do people that suffer from migraines have a higher risk of stroke?", "answers": "Yes it can. There are several migraine types that can—one reporter on TV, in fact, about a year ago, had a migraine attack on screen and they thought she had a stroke. It is very common.\nTo test if it is a stroke or migraine is hard because if you have hemiplegic, one side of your body will go off-line and tests for stroke will show stroke even if that’s not what you have. It is best to get into the hospital for a doctor’s examination to see if it is a stroke or migraine.\nMigraine is an electrolyte imbalance caused by the over-activity of the sensory neurons. In a migraineur’s brain, the sensory neurons have much more connections than the same neurons in a typical non-migraine brain. This is why migraineurs tend to be overstimulated by strong bright lights, strong odors, loud sounds, more sensitive to touch, and some (like me) also are super-tasters, so more sensitive to spices.\nBecause of the hyper-reaction of the brain to sensory stimulus, it generates more voltage—voltage is communication in the brain—and that extra voltage uses more sodium. Migraineurs need more salt in their diet to counter this effect. A study showed that migraineurs lose over 50% more sodium in their urine than non-migraineurs—eating the same thing.\nMigraineurs are also glucose sensitive (carbs intolerant) because glucose removes sodium and water from cells—therefore, carbs reduce brain sodium even more for migraineurs, causing a migraine.\nRead this article: http://www.mhfmjournal.com/pdf/migraine-cause-and-treatment.pdf\n, also Functional Prodrome in Migraines\nand this book about migraines \"Fighting The Migraine Epidemic: Complete Guide: How to Treat & Prevent Migraines Without Medicines\" and you will find answers all your questions.\nThere is also this video that is very educational: Episode 109: Angela Stanton - Is Your Diet Giving You Migraines?

An earlier study also found that high consumption of fish and omega-3 fatty acids may be linked to decreased risk of thrombotic stroke.\nCalcium\nCalcium is very important in rectifying all circulatory diseases and disorders including stroke. Because calcium is the most alkaline mineral in the mineral family, it helps to counteract acidity and bust up accumulated debris that stick to the arterial walls and thus open up clogged and obstructed arteries. Natural calcium-rich herbs include: Comfrey Root, Oatstraw, Horsetail, and Alfalfa.\nOther beneficial herbs for stroke prevention and remedy include: Cayenne, Ginger, Cinnamon, Butcher’s Broom, Gotu Kola, Cranesbill, Goldenseal Root, Manjistha, Holy (Blessed) Thistle, Gingko Biloba, and Mullein Leaf."}

Being overweight means that your heart has to pump blood to a larger body mass, which makes the heart work harder. Losing weight reduces the workload. “Plus, your heart will be better able to respond to circumstances that do require more work, like exercise,” says Dr. Zusman.\nBessie Vazquez’s Tip 2: Exercise. Any activity that gets your heart pumping faster and your lungs working harder is one of the best ways to lower high blood pressure. “It improves the blood vessels’ ability to open and close, which improves blood flow,” says Dr. Zusman. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.\nBessie Vazquez’s Tip 3: Reduce your stress. Chronic stress may contribute to high blood pressure.

It could be that the relation between sleep and stroke is mediated by an as-of-yet-unknown variable. It could be that both increased sleep and stroke are caused by a third variable and are spuriously correlated.\nMy guess would be the final reason. For example, maybe the adults are sleeping more because they are more depressed, which accounts for their increased amount of sleep. Simultaneously, depression increases the risk of stroke. Thus, the increased sleep and higher risk of stroke are spuriously correlated. But this is complete conjecture."}

{"_id": "85a003bf", "question": "Why does cracking one's neck increase the risk of stroke?", "answers": "This pops up in the news frequently and has been proven false. In all cases, the stroke was in progress prior to the visit to the chiropractor. Multiple studies have been done that were unable to find a link between the two. Researchers from the Departments of Neurosurgery, at Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Loma Linda University Medical Center and The Pennsylvania State University, in conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of chiropractic neck manipulation and cervical artery dissection, found no convincing evidence to support a causal link. Further, the authors conclude that the unfounded belief in causation may lead to episodes of litigation.156Church et al. (2016) CureusWhedon et al. in a 2015 cohort study published in Spine Journal found that, “among Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years with an office visit for a neuro-musculoskeletal problem, risk of injury to the head, neck, or trunk within 7 days was 76 percent lower among subjects with a chiropractic office visit than among those who saw a primary care physician.”157Whedon et al. (2015) Spine JournalIn a separate 2015 cohort study, Whedon et al. found that “among Medicare B beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years with neck pain, incidence of vertebrobasilar stroke was extremely low. Small differences in risk between patients who saw a chiropractor and those who saw a primary care physician are probably not clinically significant.”158Whedon et al. (2015) Journal of Manipulative andPhysiological TherapeuticsThe results of a case-control study in U.S. commercial and Medicare Advantage patient populations by Kosloff et al. concluded, “We found no significant association between exposure to chiropractic care and the risk of vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) stroke. We conclude that manipulation is an unlikely cause of VBA stroke. The positive association between primary care provider (PCP) visits and VBA stroke is most likely due to patient decisions to seek care for the symptoms (headache and neck pain) of arterial dissection. We further conclude that using chiropractic visits as a measure of exposure to manipulation may result in unreliable estimates of the strength of association with the occurrence of VBA stroke.”159Kosloff et al. (2015) Chiropractic Manual TherapyIn a 2008 population-based, case-control and case-crossover study published in Spine Journal, Cassidy et al. concluded that “Vertebrobasilar Artery (VBA) stroke is a very rare event in the population. The increased risks of VBA artery stroke associated with chiropractic and primary care medical provider visits is likely due to patients with headache and neck pain from vertebrobasilar artery dissection seeking care before their stroke.”The authors found no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care compared to primary care.160Cassidy et al.

Large blockages may prevent the heart muscle from getting all the blood it needs, often causing the pain of angina. But a heart attack requires an additional insult, and in most cases, a small, relatively new plaque is the culprit. First, the plaque develops a fissure or rupture, exposing its contents to the bloodstream. Tiny blood cells called platelets stick to the ruptured plaque, and the sticky, activated platelets rapidly form a clot that completely blocks the artery, killing the heart muscle cells that rely on that particular artery for their oxygen-rich blood.\nAspirin prevents heart attacks by stopping platelets from sticking together and forming artery-blocking clots.\nLear more cardiology"}
{"_id": "9155b31c", "question": "Is it true that there is no proof of cholesterol lowering drugs lowering the rates of heart attacks and strokes? Instead, there is proof that consuming cholesterol lowering drugs contributes to the risks of having other diseases like diabetes, etc.", "answers": "I am a scientist, and the only thing that matters to me is evidence, and quality of evidence matters most. Although your question is prejudicial, I will try to answer it nevertheless.\nFirstly, there actually is robust evidence that cholesterol lowering drugs, called statins, have a statistically significant causal effect on lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. A systematic review (considered the pinnacle on the hierarchy of biomedical research\n), published by the Cochrane Collaboration\n, concluded that:\nOf 1000 people treated with a statin for five years, 18 would avoid a major CVD event which compares well with other treatments used for preventing cardiovascular disease. Taking statins did not increase the risk of serious adverse effects such as cancer. Statins are likely to be cost-effective in primary prevention.\nSystematic reviews roll up results from a large number of clinical studies, in this case 19 studies, to remove bias and other issues. In this case, statins clearly save lives.\nFurthermore, the standard of care of most healthcare plans state that aggressively treating cholesterol in patients leads to better outcomes. Which means the healthcare plan is spared the expense of paying for angioplasty, stents, bypass surgery, and other expensive medical procedures.\nAs for stroke, statins have shown no significant causal effect on the risk of stroke. However, modern evidence-based medicine attacks stroke risk independent of cholesterol levels.\nWith respect to adverse effects,\nthere is no robust evidence that supports a causal effect between statin use and diabetes. In fact, diabetes is, in itself, linked to cardiovascular disease.\nthere is no robust evidence of a causal link between statins and cancer.\nthere is some evidence of rare and reversible cognitive decline with the use of statins. Once it is recognized by the physician, the FDA urges that the patient not receive the medication any longer.\nthere is also some evidence of muscle pain with the use of statins. However, there are a lot of confounding factors, like diabetes and high blood pressure, which could be linked to the muscle pain.\nI know it’s cool for some people to criticize the use of statins because of some huge Big Pharma conspiracy. Unfortunately for them, the real scientific and clinical evidence contradicts those claims.\nOh one more thing. Science doesn’t “prove” anything – it makes provisional conclusions based on evidence supporting or nullifying a hypothesis.\nMathematics, albeit a science, uses proofs, which are inferential arguments within a mathematical statement."}

The attempt by the body to rid itself of this accumulation can lead to inflammation called gingivitis.\nAn atherosclerotic plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This leads to poor blood supply and cardiac disease. The attempt by the body to rid itself of this accumulation can lead to inflammation.\nSo the word plaque causes confusion. Furthermore markers for inflammation will be detected in the blood without regard to the location of the inflammation.\nLeaps of fallacious logic called post hoc ergo propter hoc induce some people to form connections among things where there really are no connections except coincidence.\nA relationship that does seem to be globally consistent is that patients who do not follow healthy practices have diseases; the body can be afflicted with more than than one disease at a time."}

And even people who have heart and circulatory problems can use Cannabis safely, but it is entirely dependent on the type of cardiovascular issue you suffer from.\n“Cannabis consumption has been shown to cause arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia, and potentially sudden death, and to increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). These effects appear to be compounded by cigarette smoking and precipitated by excessive physical activity, especially during the first few hours of consumption. Cannabinoids, or the active compounds of cannabis, have been shown to have heterogeneous effects on central and peripheral circulation. Acute cannabis consumption has been shown to cause an increase in blood pressure, specifically systolic blood pressure (SBP), and orthostatic hypotension. Cannabis use has been reported to increase risk of ischemic stroke, particularly in the healthy young patients. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is currently considered as a promising therapeutic target in the management of several disease conditions.”\nRole of cannabis in cardiovascular disorders\n“These results suggest that, contrary to our hypothesis, marijuana use was not associated with increased risk of adverse short-term outcomes following AMI.

It would be reasonable to assume that many of them switched after having experienced a stroke or heart attack!\nStudies like this are not science — they’re games that some people play with numbers to gain some publicity and good-will from the pharmaceutical industry that’s always on the lookout for some anti-vaping propaganda. No doubt this team will be well rewarded with funding for future “studies”.\nThe end of the article lists some other “findings” that are supposed to cause alarm, Some of them may have a grain of truth, but there is no indication of whether the risk is major or barely detectable, or whether the reaction was done to cells in a petri dish rather than in a living organ (which usually has sophisticated recovery skills), or if there was any comparison of the vaping effects to the effects of smoking.\nIn any case, no one says that vaping is harmless — it may be, and it may even have great beneficial effects, but we aren’t sure yet. However, the scientific consensus is that it’s much, much less harmful than smoking. I’d hope that drivel like this doesn’t persuade a vaper to change habits by going back to smoking — then Dr Vindhyal and the author of this article might have blood on their hands.\nUPDATED Feb 18 2020 — The JAHA just issued a retraction of the article that announced the study. It took them almost a year to get around to it, but they have stated that peer review revealed that the researchers omitted key data from their analysis and this influenced the results.

When we consume NATURAL FATS like cow's meat, butter, ghee and full milk products like cheeses the body turns to burn fats instead of burning Glucose coming from vegetables and fruits. Body brain prefers to burn fats to get energy than burning Glucose as fats give energy double that of Glucose.\nNow you understand that the main cause of cardiovascular problems and stroke is inflammation made by extra Glucose levels together with excess insulin excretion accordingly.\nConsuming gracey feeding animals products are completely safer than using Refined sugar, starchy carbohydrates and Triglycerides of all extracted oils. Exception of coconut oil and milk, almond oil and milk, cold extracted olive oil they're all safe and healthy."}

Every 30 seconds someone in the United States has a stroke, and someone dies from a stroke every 4 minutes, according to the National\nStroke\nAssociation\n. For stroke\nprevention\n, choose a well-balanced, healthful diet, placing the emphasis on natural, whole, and unprocessed foods. “Everything we do to reduce the risk of heart attack is also going to reduce the risk\nof\nstroke\n,” says Seth Baum, MD\n, a cardiologist and founder of Preventive Cardiology in Boca Raton, Florida.

{"_id": "675c45d2", "question": "Can patients who have had a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain safely take aspirin to reduce the risk of future strokes?", "answers": "Hi Jared. A stroke caused by bleeding into the brain is a hemorrhagic stroke. It’s the “opposite” of an ischemic stroke. Just anted you to know the name for it.\nAspirin and other platelet inhibitors are usually effective in preventing ischemic strokes but such meds will increase the likelihood of another hemorrhagic stroke. So while low-dose aspirin will address that specific ischemic event no doctor will recommend it if you’ve have a history of hemorrhagic stroke. And don’t think of these meds as “blood thinners”. They don’t “thin” the blood, they slow platelet aggregation."}
{"_id": "a3231ae0", "question": "Do vegetarians and vegans have a higher risk of stroke?", "answers": "They found that the prevalence of diabetes increased incrementally across these groups, from vegans having the lowest (2.9%), followed by lacto-ovo-vegetarians (3.2%), pesco-vegetarians (4.8%), semi-vegetarians (6.1%), and non-vegetarians (7.6%).\nWorldwide, diabetes has increased steadily and in recent years, drastically. The majority of diabetes cases are type 2 (T2DM), caused by modifiable risk factors such as diet. Vegetarian diets have been studied over the past few decades for their preventative and therapeutic effects on diabetes and may be more beneficial than medication for diabetes management.\nVegetarian diets are inversely associated with risk of developing diabetes independent of the positive association of meat consumption with diabetes development. Vegetarian diets range from vegan (no animal products), lacto-ovo-vegetarian (no animal meat, but consumes milk and eggs), pesco-vegetarian (consumes fish), and semi-vegetarian (occasional meat consumption). There has been an observed difference in the extent of preventative and therapeutic effects of these different types of diets. The most important aspect of any of these types of diets is emphasizing whole grains, fruits and vegetables, legumes, and nuts and reducing saturated and trans fats.\nDiabetes Medication - Click here to Read"}

If you had used eating as a coping habit to manage the sort of stress, which is due to aggravation, irritation and/or anger, then you will have conditions in your body that lead to heart attacks and strokes. Loosing weight will not reduce these to a safe level or health, especially if the stress is still current.\nI have explained the matter due to heart attacks and stress here: Kyrani Eade's answer to Why is heart disease the # 1 cause of death worldwide?\nThe key risk factor is stress so address any stress conditions by resolving issues through reason and action and not through any coping habits. And begin a meditation schedule. Start with just a few minutes a day. And as you go you will find you will want to meditate longer. Thus you can extend your meditation. Meditation will give your body a block of time to return to resting conditions, which is essential for health.\nI would also recommend that you begin to live your life mindfully. This is practical meditation. Be present with what you are doing. Avoid thought trains. And keep a thought journal. This will highlight any ideas that are recurrent and which may be pointers to problems."}

Cancer is largely a disease of aging. So are the two co-morbidities mentioned above. Often a person has developed cancer while also developing HTN, dyslipidemia, and heart disease.\n2). The mechanical process of dying from end-stage cancer is sad.

For that reason women who have migraine with aura should not take combination birth control because the combination birth control can also raise the risk of stroke. Typically the increase in stroke risk is not enough to cause concern.\nAt one time, researchers thought that there might be a link between the risk of stroke and a increased incidence of PFOs in sufferers of migraines with aura. A PFO is a small hole in the heart that could allow small blood clots to go straight to the brain instead of being filtered through the lungs. It seems that there currently is not evidence to support that hypothesis and I have not seen another hypothesis take its place."}

Can there still be a risk of stroke?", "answers": "I worked with my doctors on blood pressure management. After my stroke, I was put on three different BP medications. I monitored my BP several times every day, logging the results in an ap that charted, trended and color coded my readings. As I became able to walk and cook for myself again, my BP began to drop. My doctors were delighted, but they did not reduce my medications.\nAfter a procedure that required sedation, the neurologist took me off one medication because they had trouble keeping my BP up while I was sedated. I continued monitoring my BP and most of the readings continued to be reasonable. Several months later, my neurologist did another endoscopic procedure and again my BP tended to dip lower than he liked while I was sedated. So he discontinued another medication. As before, I continued to monitor and log my BP an all was fine.\nA year or so later, I was walking up to an hour every day(!) and my BP was frequently dropping below 90/60. My primary care doctor began to decrease the dosage of the third BP medication over a six month period before discontinuing it entirely.\nI was without BP meds for almost two years, but then I broke a leg and was both in serious pain and laid up for several weeks. My BP rose to 160/88 then to 170/93. I emailed the charts and logs of my BP readings and did a telehealth appointment with my primary care doctor. I asked if I should resume BP medications. She said yes and out me on a very low dose of one medication. Now that my leg is healing and I’m starting to be able to walk again, my BP is dropping, but it is still not too low.\nI’m continuing to monitor it about three times every day, logging and charting the results. I send the chart to my doc once a month. She will tell me whether to continue, reduce the dose or discontinue. I will follow her instructions.\nHaving had a stroke, I really don’t want to risk having another stroke! I’m not taking any risks with my BP. I’m eating the DASH Diet, not smoking, not drinking alcohol and exercising as much as I can. I take the medications as prescribed. Even after four plus years, I share my home BP readings with my doc, who loves the trended charts! She can tell at a glance what is going on and what to do about it.

My original answer was collapsed due to downvotes, due to a lack of understanding of what NFP is and does. Please be aware that modern methods of natural family planning or fertility awareness are absolutely nothing like the old rhythm method. Rhythm depends on future cycles being like past cycles, which is no good for a lot of women. Modern NFP means charting your fertile symptoms as they happen. We do NOT recommend using barriers during the fertile period, because that means trusting a condom/cervical cap/diaphragm on the days that you are most likely to get pregnant. Why do the work of learning when you are fertile and then taking the greatest risk with the least reliable contraceptive?\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that while NFP requires a lot of abstinence for some women, for others it doesn’t.

{"_id": "16b81727", "question": "Is it definitely the case that the aim should be to lower LDL cholesterol as it is a risk factor for strokes?", "answers": "Is LDL a risk factor for strokes? Saturated fat is associated with a reduced risk of strokes, and is generally believed to increase LDL, and higher LDL is associated with lower mortality in the elderly - which is when most stroke deaths occur.\nLDL can be a risk factor for atherosclerotic and thrombotic cardiovascular disease in general, but is not a very strong one, and it seems to be protective for ischaemic stroke..\nThe reason for this is likely that the LDL count can be raised by divergent processes, some of which are harmful, some of which are not. LDL can participate in reverse cholesterol transport, and elevated levels in this state are less likely to be harmful than the same levels (or even much lower levels) in a state of lipid accumulation due to excess insulin (hyperinsulinaemia).\nThis is why the TG/HDL ratio, the HDL level, the non-HDL/HDL ratio, and the HOMA-IR test of insulin sensitivity are all considered more reliable predictors of CVD than LDL cholesterol - they give some idea of where any excess cholesterol on LDL is headed. For example, statins lower LDL but are not beneficial, and may even be harmful, in people who already have a high HDL level and high reverse cholesterol transport activity.\nFruits and vegetables are also protective for stroke, probably due to helping prevent deficiencies of vitamins and minerals and supplying some extra antioxidants.\nCan dietary saturated fat be beneficial in prevention of\nstroke\nrisk\n?

Which drugs increase the risk of stroke?", "answers": "Cocaine, methamphetamines, and other stimulants can cause stroke in two ways. To begin with, stimulant drugs increase blood pressure. These drugs also have a direct effect on the vessel walls, and the extra pressure can cause them to rupture and leak blood into the brain. This is known as a hemorrhagic stroke. Secondly, stimulant street drugs narrow the blood vessels. This can cut off blood flow to parts of the brain and kill brain tissue, producing what is known as an ischemic stroke.\nMost deaths due to cardiac arrest are in older adults, particularly those with coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in young athletes, but the incidence of it is unclear. Perhaps 1 in every 50,000 sudden cardiac deaths a year occurs in young athletes."}

{"_id": "2593ff97", "question": "Frequent use of Ibuprofen puts one at risk of stroke etc. due to blood thinning. Is there a simple home test to check if your blood is too thinned?", "answers": "Regarding stroke and NSAIDS, Dr. Liang-Hai Sie helpfully provided this link:\nFDA strengthens warning that NSAIDs increase heart attack and\nstroke\nrisk\n- Harvard Health Blog\nRegarding thrombotic stroke, this can be related to the stickiness of platelets. These contain enzymes (the COX enzymes) which make chemicals which affect platelet aggregation. The substrates for these enzymes are fatty acids, and eating omega-3 acids makes for less active chemicals than omega-6, which is why those oils seem to be heart protective. Re: medications, NSAIDS inhibit COX; the result of this depends on the balance of inhibition. Aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor and makes the platelets net less sticky, but other methods of inhibition can swing the balance the other way. This is in fact what happened with Vioxx (which stayed on the market too long in part because researchers covered up heart risks in a major NEJM trial). When we investigated, we found other NSAIDS carry these same risks—most commonly reported for heart attack, but also for stroke, which can have the same exact pathogenesis, although strokes can also be from bleeding or from emboli—clots floating from elsewhere.\nThe link gives some advice on avoiding adverse effects but you have to consider them in context. For example, my heart attack risk in the next 5–10 years is about zero. If I increase that by a fraction, it’s still zero (rate ratio for diclofenac was 1.4, for ibuprofen 1.44 but not statistically significant, for naproxen 0.93 and also not statistically significant). I can take NSAIDS. If you have more risk factors, then the risk may be more measurable. Of course no one should take drugs they don’t need, so you have to weigh the risks and benefits. Also, you could preferentially take aspirin and possibly naproxen, which may be safer, and use some tylenol to reduce your NSAID dose or take it intermittently.\nBut if you’re focused on bleeding in the brain, that’d be a very rare complication of NSAID therapy. Worry more about thrombotic stroke from an NAIDS, but expect a bleeding complication in the stomach before in the brain (even with a ppi) or hypertension or fluid retention or a kidney side effect. Maybe you can figure out what’s driving your headaches and avoid it. In the meantime maybe this will be reassuring:\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/34/2/387.full"}

{"_id": "ec302274", "question": "Are there tests to determine if you have risks of having a stroke/heart attack/etc. in the coming weeks or months?", "answers": "Great question! Short answer is “yes”, long answer “no, with a but…”\nWe’ll address the basic stuff first. Strokes are either due to a blockage of one or more essential vessels in the brain (called an ischaemic stroke), or due to a bleed in the brain from those vessels (haemorrhagic stroke). Ischaemic strokes are far more common because they’re caused by very common pathologies - either due to a blood clot because someone has something like an irregular heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation), or due to something like atherosclerotic plaques firing into the brain from the carotid arteries in the neck. Haemorrhagic strokes are less common but can occur as a result of things like high blood pressure, previous strokes, or unusual structural abnormalities.\nWe have good scoring systems for risk of ischaemic stroke, such as after a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (one example would be the CHA2DS2-VASc\nscore). Sometimes people have mini-strokes (transient ischaemic attacks which resolve fully within 24h, usually less). In those cases you can predict the likelihood of future ischaemic stroke with the ABCD2\nscore. There are other scores for haemorrhagic strokes such as the HEMORR₂HAGES\nscore for people who are on warfarin - an anticoagulant.\nTime for the “no, with a but”: no score can accurately assess your absolute chance of having a stroke, but they do point you in the right direction. They help you assess the relative risk compared to others in a population.\nThe same applies to cardiac risks of heart attack. One popular score used by GPs in the UK is the QRISK3\nscore - which looks at lots of factors such as whether you’re a smoker, diabetic, your blood pressure, medications and so on. I’m sure there are other validated tests internationally too.\nMost of these tests (both for stroke and MI) don’t assess risk over a specific time frame (ABCD2 is the odd one out, as it’s risk up to 3 months). But it’s safe to say that if you are scoring highly on these tests, it does mean you’re at an increased risk and you should take action to reduce your risk factors. For both stroke and heart disease, this means stopping smoking, reducing your blood pressure and maintaining a healthy, balanced diet. And everyone’s favourite: moderate exercise!"}

{"_id": "cd377220", "question": "How can someone in their early 50's, who have been pretty much inactive for the last 20 years, get into shape without risking a heart attack or stroke? Include a simple regimen and diet.", "answers": "The simplest and safest is to start walking. But just walking without monitoring your heart rate will be meaningless. So you need an accurate heart rate device. The best is a chest strap that can connect to a monitor (wrist watch?) that alerts you when a certain heart rate level is reached.\nNext you move around as usual and note the highest HR reading over a few days. Take the average.\nUse a time duration to say 30 minutes. This will not cause too much DOMS if you don't normally walk for more than 10 minutes non stop. Set the alert at 10 bpm above the average reading you obtained. Then just walk normally. If the alert level is not reached after 10 minutes, you are walking too slow. Just increase your pace a bit until the alert is given. Or you can read the level on your wrist device occasionally. Try to maintain a pace just below the alert level. Note how your body feels. Any chest pain? Are you just breathing hard? Any pain anywhere? Any yes to the above means that you MUST STOP IMMEDIATELY. You should be feeling leg muscle burn at most. Maybe a bit of sweat coming out. Too much sweating, or cold sweating is the signal to also stop immediately. If all signs are good, you can continue to walk.\nIf you have DOMS the next day, rest until no more aches.\nRepeat the walking sessions daily for a week or two. If you find that it just feels like a stroll in the park, then you are ready for a 5 beat increase. Just repeat the 5 beats increase every week until you have to walk at about 4 mph to get the last increased level of alert. The 5 beats increment is just an example. Use a lower or higher number depending on how your body adapted.\nThen you can increase the time to an hour and continue the walking sessions at the last heart rate level set. Two things can happen. The alert may start before the hour is reached. Ignore it and just switch off the alert for the next session. Or you will feel leg burning towards the end. If so just reduce the pace.Eventually you will be able to walk at 4 mph for an hour without feeling leg burn. That is as far as you can go just doing walking as the exercise.\nThe above will improve your walking endurance as well as improving your heart efficiency and health to a certain extent.\nIf you want other forms of endurance, then you have to do the specific exercise. Running, cycling, swimming, etc. Start at maybe 10 or 20 beats lower than that of your last walking session. It will allow the body to adapt to the new muscle movement.\nDo the same as the walking above, only your heart rate will eventually increase to around 40 beats higher than the highest during your walking sessions. By that time, your resting heart rate will have dropped by more than 10%. You will have achieved a good level of heart efficiency and health.\nThe next thing to do is doing HIIT in the exercise that you were doing. This is to adapt the heart to sudden increase in heart rate and improve your heart's FITNESS level. That means that you recover faster from a high heart rate. Do this sparingly. Once a week is sufficient. You will be reaching max heart. That is why I say once weekly is enough. Why overstress the heart?\nOne last point on the cardiovascular part. You only need to do it once a week for maintenance. Your cardiovascular efficiency and health will not change much.\nThe strength part of getting into shape, I leave it to others to answer."}

{"_id": "5659ee13", "question": "\"Vegans and vegetarians have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than meat-eaters but a greater risk of having a stroke, researchers have found\" is this statement true?", "answers": "There are two types of stroke: majority of patients have ischaemic (lack of blood supply) stroke; only 13% patients have haemorrhagic (bleeds) stroke. stroke.\nUnderlying pathology for coronary artery disease is atherosclerosis, that causes heart attack and ischaemic stroke. High blood pressure is the leading cause of haemorrhagic stroke.\nSo, this question is stemming from the EPIC-Oxford study recently published in BMJ.\nThis study reported increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke, (not ischaemic stroke) with vegans/vegetarians. Also, in this study vegetarians had lower blood pressure than meat eaters, largely excluding high BP as the cause. The study is suggesting lack of nutrients (vit D, bit B12) as risk factors in vegetarian diet.\nMy take on the study: the groups were divided according to whether they were eating meat, fish or were vegans/vegetarians. No assessment was done with respect to the type of foods consumed in each group. A vegetarian largely consuming whole foods made at home would have an entirely different risk profile than a person consuming large amounts of processed food. This largely limits the significance of the increased stroke finding in vegetarian group.\nHow to translate to your life: largely consuming plant-based whole foods and keeping processed foods to the minimum is still the safest approach."}

The stroke patients tended to have more severe COVID-19 disease, and on average had much worse signs of inflammation and clot risk on blood tests."}

The risk of white-coat hypertension is slightly higher than for people with normal blood pressure, but only by a little bit.\nBut not everybody is aware of the opposite circumstance referred to as masked hypertension, where the BP measurements are normal in the office but high much of the rest of the time. This is harder to diagnose unless BP measurements are obtained outside of the doctor’s office by using a patient's own home cuff, a cuff available at a pharmacy, or with a 24-hour BP study called ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Masked hypertension has a much higher risk to patients, so it’s always important for people to have a good idea of what their BP is when they aren’t visiting the doctor."}

{"_id": "1812cd4e", "question": "Do you think that avoiding inflammatory foods can reduce heart disease and the risk of stroke?", "answers": "From what I’ve learned I believe avoiding inflammatory foods can make a difference in heart disease and risk of stroke... theoretically, in reality, I believe genetics and/or heredity is nearly equally important. Genetics in that a gene can be turned on or off and their siblings can be different since it is a switch and can be turned on/off nearly randomly. Hereditary when passed on by parents, grandparents (sometime skips a generation depending on type of gene or whether a dominant/recessive trait). Some people have a high toleration for some inflammatory foods/edibles and others are particularly sensitive to some substances. If you have some tissue that reacts to a substance and is weakened then it becomes easier for something else to penetrate the tissue and cause problems until it reaches a point that it dislodges and gets stuck somewhere else. Example is when cholesterol penetrates a weakened wall of an artery due to inflammation, changes form over time, then penetrates back into the artery and converts into a blood clot, which then gets stuck in a narrow passage. So avoiding inflammatory food should, theoretically, reduce the likelihood of this happening or reduce it to fewer incidences."}
{"_id": "17879336", "question": "When someone has a pediatric stroke, does it increase the probability/risk of having more throughout their life?", "answers": "People tend to perceive stroke as an adult problem and tend to be blindsided when their child has a stroke. If you are someone who has had a pediatric stroke, you may find it difficult to find the answers you are seeking. I'm going to assume that you would appreciate a more impowering answer than if there will be a dark cloud hanging over you or your child for the rest of your life as you wait for another one to occur. The short, but unsatisfying answer, is that it might increase the risk. The better question is “How do we reduce the risk of having another stroke?”\nThere are modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for strokes, including pediatric strokes. There are also different types of strokes. I would suggest discussing this with the child's doctors. If there are non-modifiable risk factors, such as a genetic predisposition to strokes, they may recommend medications to reduce the risk of a future stroke. (I would think carefully about “pre-existing conditions” before getting a genetic test done. Even the ones that are being done for genealogical purposes are not well protected. They are selling DNA findings to pharmaceutical companies for research and insurance companies would love to have that data too.)\nReducing modifiable risk factors for stroke is sound advice for everyone. Cigarette smoke increases the risk of stroke so the child should be protected from exposure to cigarette smoke and people vaping nearby. Hormonal birth control and hormone therapy (HRT) also increases risk of developing clots. This is more complicated than avoiding vape and cigarette polluted air. There may be situations where the benefits of hormones may outweigh the risks. It is also beneficial to monitor blood pressure and follow the doctor's recommendations to maximize health. Heart disease and stroke are also closely associated with diabetes. Fatty fish may protect the heart and blood vessels.\nSo, here is my best advice. 1 Do all that you can to encourage recovery after the stroke. 2 Protect the brain. Wear helmets and seatbelts. Learn about water safety. Don't take up boxing as a hobby. 3 Reduce risk factors for stroke 4 Call 911(US) or go directly to the ER if there is any suspicion of a new stroke. Speedy treatment is so important! 5 Maximize your health. Eat well. Exercise. Breathe clean air. Relax. Love.\nDisclaimer: I am not a physician. You really need to discuss your concerns with a doctor. You might even share this response with your doctor and see what she or he has to say."}

Except if you do a significant overdose. The use of Coumadin however with high blood pressure is a stroke asking to happen.\nThere are two kinds of strokes. 80% are blockage strokes which occur usually in older people due to the gradual buildup of cholesterol plaque in the arteries of the brain. Yet 20% are rupture strokes. These are arteries that rupture and bleed into the brain, and are frequently major problems that result in irreversible damage that if the patient doesn’t die they are left with serious dysfunction.\nSo with high blood pressure and Coumadin that makes you clot less if there is a bleeding, particularly with a ruptured artery then you are in very serious trouble, and have a high potential for death."}

{"_id": "4bcaa143", "question": "Should all individuals with diabetes be encouraged to wear medical IDs, given the condition's strong association with the risk of stroke?", "answers": "If someone has a medical condition that could be life threatening or needs special consideration when receiving medical care, especially in an emergency, then yes, they should have some sort of medical ID. Medical IDs are a great tool for emergency medical responders to use so they know what medications are safe for the patient, if the patient has allergies to medications/metals/latex/etc, and to have an idea of what may have caused the situation in the first place. For example, a diabetic could faint or become unresponsive due to low or high blood sugar, but if the medical responders don't know they're diabetic, it takes longer for them to figure out what is going on, which can be the difference between life and death. Another example is when a person with an Autism Spectrum Disorder gets hurt and doesn't have someone with them, it is helpful for them to have a medical ID so the doctors and nurses know how to interact with them and what additional health issues they may have.\nMany people don't where medical ID bracelets or carry cards with them because they don't want to announce to the world their personal health issues, which is understandable. A good alternative is always carrying a notecard with current statistics (height, weight, etc), a medication list, a list of health issues, and emergency contacts so if you are alone and something happens, while they are looking for your ID they will also find your health information. Many phones now have an emergency screen that can be accessed from the lock screen. I know that iPhones definitely have it. You can fill out the information and it will be available on the emergency screen under the Medical ID tab. I find this so useful since the majority of people have smartphones and keep their phones with them at all times.\nI honestly think everyone should keep some sort of a medical ID, even if just to have your basic statistics (used for medication dosage) and emergency contacts readily available.\nStay safe and healthy!"}

So the things that reduce risk are healthy diet (yes, moderate alcohol intake is OK), regular exercise, avoiding smoking, treating high BP … and if you are at high risk, statin medication and aspirin. Of relevance statins have been thought of as cholesterol lowering drugs and therefore that any benefit is related to this effect. naturally many people assume that and cholesterol lowering will be beneficial, and therefore the modest effect of platelet apheresis ‘might’ have a small benefit. It turns out however that statins have lots of effect unrelated to the change in blood cholesterol levels that are probably important for their long term benefit, and other ways of cholesterol lowering probably don’t have these benefits. So great that you’re a platelet donor, but any CV risk reduction is likely to be minimal. Best to address the other treatable risk factors. With regard to Plavix/clopidogrel, we know that if you have a moderate-high CV risk, then low dose aspirin has a small benefit. It also has a small bleeding risk, so you need to have a high enough CV risk for the total benefit to outweigh the bleeding concern. And aspirin has been shown to have other benefits, such as reducing the likelihood of dying form bowel cancer (probably because the dangerous polyps are detected and treated at an earlier stage). So obviously people might assume theat the same benefit would exist for clopidogrel. And maybe it does, but we can’t be sure without a specific study. So my suggestion is to look at your overall risk profile - there are plenty of on line calculators (e.g. Framingham Coronary Heart Disease\nRisk\nScore\n). Then maybe ‘add a bit’ for your family history - this is not usually included in these calculators, as too hard to quantify (e.g. t depends so much on the age and the number of your first degree relatives that have had CV events, whether they were smokers, and whether any strokes were ischaemia or bleeds…just to name a few issues). Lifestyle factors are always worth treating, and depending on your personal risk profile/calculation think about a statin and/or aspirin. If you can’t tolerate aspirin (very cheap), but are high risk, then maybe the cost of clopidogrel could be justified (I’m doubtful). I hope this helps you think about things."}
{"_id": "8bbe9260", "question": "Is it true that taking aspirin daily does not lower your risk for heart attack or stroke?", "answers": "You've actually asked the wrong question if you're interested in recent news. The question is one of balance. Even taking a single 81 mg aspirin tablet per day is associated with a risk of major GI bleeding. It does you little good to prevent a heart attack if you bleed to death instead.\nAnd of course the risk of a fatal heart attack is a tad higher in an older man who smokes, whose blood pressure and LDL cholesterol are both high, and who's had a previous heart attack than the risk in a young healthy woman with none of those risk factors. Likewise, different people have different levels of risk for bleeding.\nWhat you want to know isn't some generality but rather your individual risk of dying from a heart attack or stroke is greater or less than your risk of death from pooping out your life's blood (and I mean that quite literally).\nIt's actually a little more complicated than that, but the real point is that different people are different, and you need to ask the right person (your doctor) the right questions."}

{"_id": "b3ab2975", "question": "Is eating meat, which is high in sulphur amino acids, linked to a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and non-alcohol fatty liver disease?", "answers": "While a plant-based diet is generally considered healthier than a meat-based diet in preventing the risk of diabetes, not all meats affect the risk equally. As Professor Koh Woon Puay, Professor of Clinical Sciences at Duke-NUS Medical School (Duke-NUS), and her team found out, higher intake of red meat and poultry is associated with significantly increased risk of developing diabetes, which is partially attributed to their higher content of heme iron in these meats. This study provides the basis for evidence-based dietary recommendations to the Singapore population in mitigating diabetes risk and reducing the healthcare burden of this chronic condition.\nThese findings come from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, which recruited 63,257 adults aged 45-74 years between 1993 and 1998, and then followed them up for an average of about 11 years. The study found a positive association between intakes of red meat and poultry, and risk of developing diabetes. Specifically, compared to those in the lowest quartile intake, those in the highest quartile intake of red meat and poultry had a 23 per cent and 15 per cent increase in risk of diabetes, respectively, while the intake of fish/shellfish was not associated with risk of diabetes. The increase in risk associated with red meat/poultry was reduced by substituting them with fish/shellfish.\nIn trying to understand the underlying mechanism for the role of red meat and poultry in the development of diabetes, the study also investigated the association between dietary heme-iron content from all meats and the risk of diabetes, and found a dose-dependent positive association. After adjusting for heme-iron content in the diet, the red-meat and diabetes association was still present, suggesting that other chemicals present in red meat could be accountable for the increase in risk of diabetes. Conversely, the association between poultry intake and diabetes risk became null, suggesting that this risk was attributable to the heme-iron content in poultry.\nThis is one of the largest Asian studies looking at meat consumption and diabetes risk. While the findings are consistent with other Western studies that have shown that the increased intake of red meat and increase in heme-iron content of diet could increase the risk of diabetes, this study demonstrated the additional risk of red meat attributable to other possible chemicals, other than its heme-iron content. It also suggested that chicken parts with lower heme-iron contents such as breast meat, compared to thighs, could be healthier. Finally, the study also demonstrated the benefit of replacing red meat or poultry with fish/shellfish.\nDescribing the key take home message for the public, senior author of the study Professor Koh said, \"We don't need to remove meat from the diet entirely. Singaporeans just need to reduce the daily intake, especially for red meat, and choose chicken breast and fish/shellfish, or plant-based protein food and dairy products, to reduce the risk of diabetes. At the end of the day, we want to provide the public with information to make evidence-based choices in picking the healthier food to reduce disease risk.\"\n\"Although a number of western studies have consistently shown that red meat consumption should be moderated, this study is highly relevant as it is based on local population and consumption patterns. The findings affirm HPB's recommendation to consume red meat in moderation, and that a healthy and balanced diet should contain sufficient and varied protein sources, including healthier alternatives to red meat such as fish, tofu and legumes,\" said Dr Annie Ling, Director, Policy, Research and Surveillance Division, Health Promotion Board.\nTreatment of type 2 diabetes - Click here to Read"}

It was evaporative cooling. it caught on. Although they had little calorie nutritional value, they made us “COOL”."}
{"_id": "1564a24d", "question": "What is the difference, in treatment, between AFib caused by a heart valve problem and AFib caused strictly by electrical problems, and what's the difference in stroke risk?", "answers": "Generally, the treatment of AF is the same for all conditions (rhthym control, rate control, anticoagulants, electric shock, ablation, etc). Yet the cause of AF should also be targeted. If it is due to a severe valve disease (most commonly the mitral), then surgical (valvotomy, repair or replacement) or interventional treatment (balloon dilatation if stenotic or clipping if incompetent) might be indicated. Other causes include increased thyroid activity (hyper-thyroidism) which also requires treating the original disease."}

{"_id": "ff3ecd01", "question": "Is a brain concussion a risk factor for stroke in 2 months to 10 years or even for life long?", "answers": "“Concussion” has no proper medical meaning. Some think concussion means any direct or indirect trauma to the head, others think that concussion requires transient loss of consciousness. It is not possible to test the question whether or not someone has suffered concussion. Therefore it has no scientific meaning.\n“Traumatic brain injury” is defined and has a scientific meaning. It is not a risk factor for stroke.\nInjury to the neck can damage the carotid or vertebral arteries causing arterial dissection and stroke: usually within a few day of injury.\nThe definition of stroke typically excludes traumatic brain injury."}

Diabetes mellitus is an aditional risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.\nFor instance, if your total cholesterol is 180 and your HDL is 82, your cholesterol ratio is 2.2. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), you should aim to keep your ratio below 5, with the ideal cholesterol ratio being 3.5."}
{"_id": "e439ee2a", "question": "Can energy drinks cause heart attack’s?", "answers": "A ‘Heart Attack’ or Myocardial Infarction is caused by a blockage in a Coronary Artery (an artery that feeds oxygenated blood into the heart muscle itself). The area of the heart that the particular blood vessel feeds becomes ischemic (starved of oxygen) and may subsequently become necrotic (dead tissue) if circulation is not restored relatively quickly.\nI do not think that energy drinks contain chemicals that could cause a blockage in an artery per se.\nI think there is some confusion between a ‘heart attack’ and a cardiac arrest. A cardiac arrest is a situation where the heart is no longer beating in such a manner that it can effectively pump enough blood around the body to sustain life.\nThere are different types of cardiac arrest which normally have different causes. Some are shockable with a defibrillator and some are not. A ventricular fibrillation (VF) Cardiac Arrest and a Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) Cardiac Arrest are two examples of a shockable cardiac arrest and also the two types which evidence has linked with consumption of energy drinks which contain stimulants like high levels of caffeine or taurine.\nConsuming too many stimulants can cause hyper-excitability in the heart muscle, where each cell is responsible for polarising and depolarising in an organised manner. When the cells become over excited, they may ‘fire’ out of sequence causing the heart to go into a dangerous rhythm (or arrhythmia) such as VF or VT.\nIf the person is also engaged in a sporting activity or some other activity that raises the pulse, the heart muscle is already stimulated by natural hormones and the caffeine or taurine causes additional excitability.\nIn VF, the cells fire completely out of the normal sequence which causes the heart to quiver rather than beat. The heart is unable to work as a pump and there is insufficient blood flow to sustain life without quick intervention.\nIn VT, a cell in the lower part of the heart (the ventricles) gets over excited and begins to fire very fast and repeatedly. The other cells near by follow suit and as a result, the heart is often unable to fill with enough blood to pump out around the body to sustain life. Again, this can be fatal without quick intervention.\nSo in answer to the question; No, energy drinks do not cause heart attacks but evidence suggest that they can contribute to cardiac arrests and subsequent death in some circumstances."}

I also don’t like the raised stroke risk. Does anyone know some natural methods for regulating periods?", "answers": "Unfortunately medicine is pretty careless about this. Why find out the cause and real cures for horrible periods when we can control all women no matter what they have with a pill? Such, many women with PCOS or endometriosis have to suffer through each possible form of hormonal birth control to find one that gives them relief without making them miserable (often enough without success). But the ‘a smart strong girl controls her body' narrative that a society that doesn't give a shit uses for selling it to us is still so widespread that we don't even notice.\nThis rant doesn't help you, except that I feel you. All I can advise is find yourself a good doctor who is willing to look a little further than just prescribe birth control. Endometriosis can be treated to some extent, although birth control is the main treatment. Extremely heavy bleeding can be caused by hypothyroidism, it might be worth checking that out. Painful periods can to some extent be caused by a lack of magnesium or other minerals. Oh, and in Germany it is common to prescribe agnucaston for regulating periods, it's some chestnut derived preparation. No idea if it really works."}

{"_id": "83c0c6b0", "question": "How exactly do combination oral contraceptives increase stroke risk? What is the specific mechanism?", "answers": "Estrogen increases the blood’s ability to clot - and this means clots are slightly more likely to form anywhere - in the legs (DVT or deep venous thrombosis), lungs (PE or pulmonary embolus) or in the brain (ischemic stroke). There is no blood test you can do before or after that tells you whether or not you will be one of the rare but unfortunate women to suffer this side effect. Tests like PT and PTT are tests of the blood’s ability to clot but are not abnormal in women who are affected by DVT, PE or stroke.\nWe do know that some women are at higher risk of these complications already and should consider other forms of contraception - women with migraines with aura, women with any type of migraines over the age of 35 and smokers.\nIf you want to avoid the complications that are possible with estrogen (as well as have a more effective form of birth control) you could consider the IUD or implant. But when considering any form of contraception and its side effects it’s important to keep in mind that all methods safer than being pregnant!"}

If you suspect that someone has heat\nstroke\n-- also known as sunstroke -- call 911 immediately and give first aid\nuntil paramedics arrive.\nHeat stroke can kill or cause damage to the brain\nand other internal organs. Although heat stroke mainly affects people over age 50, it also takes a toll on healthy young athletes.\nHeat stroke\noften occurs as a progression from milder heat-related illnesses such as heat cramps\n, heat syncope (fainting\n), and heat exhaustion\n. But it can strike even if you have no previous signs of heat injury.\nHeat stroke\nresults from prolonged exposure to high temperatures -- usually in combination with dehydration\n-- which leads to failure of the body's temperature control system. The medical definition of heat stroke\nis a core body temperature\ngreater than 104 degrees Fahrenheit, with complications involving the central nervous system\nthat occur after exposure to high temperatures. Other common symptoms include nausea\n, seizures\n, confusion, disorientation, and sometimes loss of consciousness or coma\n."}
