{"_id": "6e1ac3c8", "question": "How do brain hemorrhages happen?", "answers": "Because the majority of brain\nhemorrhages\nare linked with special risk factors, you can minimize your risk in the following ways: Treat high blood pressure. Researches explain that 80% of cerebral hemorrhage victims have a history of high blood pressure. The single most important thing you can do is control yours through food, yoga, and prescription. Don’t smoke. Don’t use pills. Cocaine, for example, can increase the risk of bleeding in the brain. Drive carefully, and wear your seat bel If you ride a bike, always wear a helmet. Study corrective surgery. If you suffer from abnormalities, such as aneurysms, an operation may help to prevent future bleeding. Be careful with Coumadin. If you take this drug, also called warfarin, follow up regularly with your doctor to make sure your blood levels are in the correct range.\nIf are looking for brain hemorrhages then you should Contact Neurologist in Jaipur"}
{"_id": "0e09ff07", "question": "What is the time of recovery for a brain hemorrhage?", "answers": "It entirely depends on the location and severity of the hemorrhage. For example, if it's coming from a tiny blood vessel in the part of the brain that controls your left hand, you wouldn't likely lose consciousness at all. But if it happened in a major blood vessel near your brainstem, you probably would never wake up, because you would most likely be dead.\nMost hemorrhages are somewhere in between. It could be a few minutes, hours, days, or longer.\nIf you know someone currently unconscious from a brain hemorrhage, you should ask their doctor or someone else who is taking care of them. And you have my sympathy because that is a hard situation, especially when you don't know how long it will last.\nIf you need to know what kind of hemorrhage would cause someone to be unconscious for a specific amount of time (maybe you're writing a book or a game or some such) then I recommend asking another question along the lines of “What is a plausible location for a brain hemorrhage that would cause someone to be unconscious for (however long)? For a story, I want to know how a doctor would describe it.”\nEither way, I hope things go well."}
{"_id": "72b03708", "question": "What is a brain hemorrhage?", "answers": "A brain\nhemorrhage\nis a type of stroke\n. It's caused by an artery\nin the brain\nbursting and causing localized bleeding in the surrounding tissues. This bleeding kills brain\ncells.\nThe Greek root for blood\nis hemo. Hemorrhage literally means \"blood\nbursting forth.\" Brain\nhemorrhages are also called cerebral hemorrhages, intracranial hemorrhages, or intracerebral hemorrhages. They account for about 13% of strokes.\nWhat Happens During a Brain Hemorrhage?\nWhen blood from trauma irritates brain\ntissues, it causes swelling. This is known as cerebral edema\n. The pooled blood collects into a mass called a hematoma\n. These conditions increase pressure on nearby brain tissue, and that reduces vital blood flow and kills brain cells.\nBleeding can occur inside the brain, between the brain and the membranes that cover it, between the layers of the brain's covering or between the skull and the covering of the brain.\nWhat Causes Bleeding in the Brain?\nThere are several risk factors and causes of brain hemorrhages. The most common include:\nHead trauma\n. Injury is the most common cause of bleeding in the brain for those younger than age 50.\nHigh blood pressure\n. This chronic condition can, over a long period of time, weaken blood vessel walls. Untreated high blood pressure\nis a major preventable cause of brain hemorrhages.\nAneurysm\n. This is a weakening in a blood vessel wall that swells. It can burst and bleed into the brain, leading to a stroke\n.\nBlood vessel abnormalities. (Arteriovenous malformations) Weaknesses in the blood vessels in and around the brain may be present at birth and diagnosed only if symptoms develop.\nAmyloid angiopathy. This is an abnormality of the blood vessel walls that sometimes occurs with aging and high blood pressure\n. It may cause many small, unnoticed bleeds before causing a large one.\nBlood or bleeding disorders. Hemophilia\nand sickle cell anemia\ncan both contribute to decreased levels of blood platelets.\nLiver\ndisease. This condition is associated with increased bleeding in general.\nBrain tumors\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Brain Bleeding?\nThe symptoms of a brain hemorrhage can vary. They depend on the location of the bleeding, the severity of the bleeding, and the amount of tissue affected. Symptoms may develop suddenly or over time. They may progressively worsen or suddenly appear.\nIf you exhibit any of the following symptoms, you may have a brain hemorrhage. This is a life-threatening condition, and you should call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. The symptoms include:\nA sudden severe headache\nSeizures\nwith no previous history of seizures\nWeakness\nin an arm or leg\nNausea\nor vomiting\nDecreased alertness; lethargy\nChanges in vision\nTingling or numbness\nDifficulty speaking or understanding speech\nDifficulty swallowing\nDifficulty writing or reading\nLoss of fine motor skills, such as hand tremors\nLoss of coordination\nLoss of balance\nAn abnormal sense of taste\nLoss of consciousness\nKeep in mind that many of these symptoms are often caused by conditions other than brain hemorrhages.\nFor more information: https://www.webmd.com/brain/brain-hemorrhage-bleeding-causes-symptoms-treatments\nSource:Brain\nHemorrhage\n: Causes, Symptoms, Treatments\n.\nThanks you._/\\_"}

{"_id": "9b0d156b", "question": "What are the long term effects of brain hemorrhage?", "answers": "The answer to this question has several factors we have to consider.\nWithout the oxygen carried by blood, brain cells can quickly die and lead to permanent brain damage.\nObviously, you can guess that the location where the hemorrhage occurs is the most important determining factor.\nA brain hemorrhage can literally cause someone to just drop dead without warning. While that is an extreme case, ICHs can cause severe and permanent brain damage.\nThis photo shows a massive yet textbook cerebrovascular event:\n(A) MASSIVE cerebral infarct in the deep layers of the left-hemisphere.\n(B) Left cranial defect and decrease in a shift of midline structures on the first day after decompressive craniectomy.\nIf you have a weak stomach look away.\nThere is a huge subarachnoid beginning to form in (A) and this puts an extreme amount of pressure on the underlying tissue. The former is clearly demonstrated in the first photo, as the midline has shifted dramatically. Two days post-op, the patient remained in a vegetative state.\nIf the ICH causes severe cranial vascular malformation, death increases tenfold. Since ICHs occur as a result of a ruptured blood vessel, whether it be trauma-induced or the result of an aneurysm, blood flow to the brain (or that specific region) is rendered FUBARed.\nDeep intracranial hemorrhages are very difficult to operate on. As a surgeon, our first priority is to locate and stop the bleeding as fast as possible. Deep ICHs flood the entire brain, and locating one that does not present superficially is like trying to find an ice cube in a swimming pool.\nAs surgeons, we also have to consider the structural integrity of the surrounding tissue. We can't just go Rambo in a brain, stop the bleed, and expect the patient to regain complete function- that's Ludacris.\nAntihypertensive agents are used in large quantities to lower the patient's blood pressure. Higher blood pressure=more bleeding.\nThe problem herein is that the brain tissue is inherently DAF (delicate as fuck), sometimes we can only stop the bleed without vascular complete reconstruction. As a result, the patient will likely suffer permanent handicaps with regard to the amount of tissue death.\nThe harm: benefit ratio is imperative to consider when a patient presents with a massive ICH. Keep in mind that it is still a race against the clock. We locate the ICH, but we are far from out of the woods; as is the patient.\ntPAs can be used in the case of an ischemic stroke to break-up a blood clot, restoring blood flow. Hemorrhagic strokes and severe ICHs cannot be treated with tPAs, as clotting factors act as our friend when we are trying to prevent further blood loss.\nNOW.\nRecovery from a hemorrhagic stroke is slow and requires a prolonged hospital stay. Occupational, speech, and physical therapy may also be needed to improve motor skills affected by brain damage.\nI have seen minor cases where a patient can be discharged after a few days.\nUnfortunately, since ACHs are not forgiving at all, I have seen many severe cases that require full craniotomies, vascular surgeons, neurosurgeons, and the like.\nGenerally, in order to stop the bleed, further damage is an inevitable part of this process. I have seen a countless number of patients die before and during surgery, and brain hemorrhages really don't fuck around.\nIt is a literal bloody mess, but I have seen patients regain near complete functionality, however after the air hits the brain- no one is the same.\nI hope that answered your question.

{"_id": "7d932229", "question": "Is taking aspirin to prevent a stroke a probable risk for a brain hemorrhage?", "answers": "First of all, it matters how much aspirin you are talking about, and how often. It’s typically used to thin the blood for the heart. When patients would tell me this, they would say the doctor told me to take and aspirin a day, or a half of an aspirin per day (which breaks the enteric coating and causes stomach issues). Many times, the patients wouldn’t put it on their meds list, because it’s “just” aspirin, I’d look into their eye, and ask if they were taking aspirin. They would ask how I knew; they would have “micro aneurysms”, little microscopic bleeding in the eye.\nA standard Aspirin is 325 mg, too much for daily consumption, as is a half 162mg; half of a half aspirin has been the most common dosage for daily use, that’s 81mg, sold as a chewable baby aspirin (my choice) or as the brand Ecotrin.\nAs for strokes, as you get older, a doctor can turn the end of a stethoscope around to the “Bell” potion and listen to your carotid arteries in your neck, listing for what’s called “Bruit” (brewey), a swooshing sound in your neck, sometimes only in one of the 2 carotids on either side. In the eye, I can see “Holenhorst Plaques”, flat flakes that break off of the cholesterol in your carotids. When I look in, they look like someone is back in your retina with a bright yellow flashlight shining back at me, if the flat side is facing me. If on edge they are harder to see, these can be easily missed. Sometimes, I can press on the eye, and make them flash on and off. It is not a good sign. I send the patients out for an Echo, ultrasound of the carotids.\nI tell the patients that they may have an impending stroke to make sure they get in, timely. I had one patient actually have a stroke, while they were doing the procedure. They hit her with some “clot buster” medications and was fine. She was very grateful at her next visit, when she told me the story. I would say ¾ th’s of patients I sent out, ended up having a procedure to remove the clots from their carotid arteries."}

To check if these are real symptoms, you may try 2 or 3 steps e.g. ask the patient to- 1) smile well, 2) say a complete sentence and repeat it, 3) to utter some difficult word like Czechoslovakia, and repeat it 4) raise both of his hands high in the air, 5) protrude the tongue outside straightly. If he is unable to do all these easily then may be a brain haemorrhage has taken place and you should take the patient to the doctor, as early as possible. To prevent, in case of an elderly person and having blockage problem, he should walk slowly for at least 15 mins. Minimise , as far as possible , consumption of Fried food as these food may contain cholesterol, not to dissolve in blood. It may become the reason of blockage and bleeding in tissue or ventricles & cause brian haemorrhage. Eat green leafy vegetables as much as possible and cook these in minimum oil."}

How can she expedite the recovery process?", "answers": "Your mother already has one of the most important aspects of recovery: a supportive family. Without knowing details, it is hard to say what should be done. I would point out that there are many theories about recovery, perhaps the right approach has not been provided. In addition, some therapists are true specialists in these types of problems. It is important to find someone who really knows what they are doing. And my third and final piece of advice is that treatment should be continual: using techniques such as appropriate positioning and bilateral activities will work much better if they are done during daily tasks instead of just a few times a week in the therapy gym. I hope this has been helpful."}

I have visited a few other rehab centers too, and most of them function as nursing homes and some of them as an affiliate to hospitals. Sukino is the one and only player that provides personalised, I repeat, personalised care that focuses on the person overall-wellbeing rather than just the disease. The center is aptly setup just for one service i.e. post surgery/post hospital care\nLong story short: My father had brain aneurysm surgery a few years ago and the doctor told us it could take months for him to completely recover from it. My brother and I started taking turns to look after him since he couldn’t do much but we realised that it was a lot of work for us and we needed professional help. We then decided to try homecare, and little less than two weeks into it, we realised it was a wrong decision considering the intensive care he needed at that time.. That’s when a colleague of mine told me about Sukino’s neuro rehabilitation centre in Bangalore. Sukino’s team indeed helps fasten the recovery process, the way they care is what anybody would love to see their loved ones being cared for and they did it much better than my family and I would have.\nMy father’s treatment plan includes many sessions with physiotherapists, occupational therapists,speech and swallow therapists and yoga therapy. They also do have a dietician to guide the F&B team on a personalised diet plan. We visited him often at the centre and there was a noticeable improvement each time. Sukino’s staff were very helpful throughout the process and took care of all my father’s needs. I definitely suggest you go for Sukino – they are a caring bunch who look after their patients like family.\nFor more information about Sukino’s neuro rehabilitation care, please visit: https://www.sukino.com/Neuro-Rehabilitation-Center"}
{"_id": "aca2ae3a", "question": "Which are the best full-time physiotherapy centers in India for a brain hemorrhage patient?", "answers": "I constantly accepted I'd work an all day work until the day I resigned. I had never at any point known about routine set of expenses business, significantly less thought about it as a possibility for myself.\nAt that point, three years into exercise based recuperation practice, I ended up at an intersection.\nI had been working two low maintenance occupations at little outpatient orthopedic facilities, feeling a piece overpowered by both, and yearning to return to an emergency clinic condition. A previous colleague of mine revealed to me his emergency clinic was contracting an intense consideration routine set of expenses physical advisor—and that per diems much of the time went full-time. Along these lines, I chose to give it a go.\nThings worked out: I found the activity, and routine set of expenses PT ended up being the best thing that at any point transpired as a treating clinician. The adaptability and significant compensation empowered me to concentrate on a wide range of different interests on my days off. I wrapped up never filling in as a full-time physical specialist again!\nWhat is outlay exercise based recuperation\n?\nRoutine set of expenses—or PRN—active recuperation differs from office to office, however as a rule, outlay PTs fill in as available to come back to work physical advisors. Offices use them for additional inclusion on days when full-time staff individuals are debilitated, traveling, or generally inaccessible. Now and again, outlay physical advisors wind up working nearly as much as full-time PTs, while in different cases, they just work a couple of days a month.\nAs a routine set of expenses PT, you'll some of the time realize your work dates ahead of time, however you'll regularly discover you're required the prior night—or even the day of—a move. Movements are typically eight hours in length, and they could possibly have adaptable hours, contingent upon the office.\nThese positions quite often come without business benefits, which means you won't get took care of time, days off (except if they're state-commanded), proceeding with instruction inclusion, medical coverage, or different advantages. Those advantages aren't modest, so in case you're not accepting them, your boss ordinarily will \"improve the pot\" by employing you at a higher hourly rate. This compensation differential is considerably increasingly articulated when you're new out of school.\nObviously, there are a few downsides also: you'll be the first to have your hours diminished when the registration drops or things get moderate. There will likewise be times when you need to see patients while different specialists go to group building occasions and workforce gatherings. Along these lines, it's anything but difficult to get a handle on left as an outlay advisor.\nBasically, you can consider routine set of expenses as having \"no surprises\" on the two sides of the coin—which implies you'll have unmatched adaptability. Simultaneously, it implies you'll have to take a considerable amount of activity to guarantee you're getting what you need in the method for hours and expert development.\nHere are a couple of tips to make routine set of expenses work for you:"}

{"_id": "d96a654b", "question": "How do I differentiate brain hemorrhage and infarct in a CT scan?", "answers": "First, OP, you need to attend and successfully complete medical or osteopathic school (as one would express in at least American terms.) Then you need to learn the fundamental concepts of CT scanning, including not only the basic physics, the ramifications of the BBB (Blood-Brain Barrier,) but also radiologic terms such as mass effect.\nThen you can learn the attenuation and morphologic characteristics of both hemorrhage and infarction over time."}
{"_id": "d9d4d8f9", "question": "Why does an upper respiratory infection cause head aches, reduced neurological function, and symptoms resembling brain hemorrhage?", "answers": "A headache is a symptom, not a diagnosis or a condition. People with migraines, or chronic tension headaches, or another headache disorder will frequently have headaches as a symptom or as a part of whatever else is going on, including an infection.\nWith URIs (Upper respiratory infections), the coughing motion transmits forces to the neck/head, increasing the likelihood of headaches to those predisposed. The valsalva (bearing down) of a cough can also increase the chance of headaches, also via the neck (not through increased intracranial pressure, at least not in most people).\nThose with URIs with sinus involvement can have trigeminal irritation, increasing chance of headaches. Most actual sinus headaches present as facial or dental pain, not actual headache.\nYour brain hemorrhage comment makes me wonder if you, or the person you’re thinking about, has had a brain hemorrhage previously. Symptoms of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), or any other previous structural CNS disturbance (tumor resection, MS attack, trauma), from which they have recovered can re-express the previous symptoms during a systemic illness, when tired, even at the end of a long day. This is not a new event, but the “rewiring” from the old event decompensating due to the illness/fatigue. Once no longer ill or tired, things go back to how they recently were. URI’s can certainly do this, as can the flu, a urinary tract infection, etc.\nTherefore, get the flu shot, wash your hands, use purell, etc!\nI hope this helped."}

Controlling Daily Sodium and Calories To benefit from the proven DASH eating plan, it is important to limit daily sodium levels to 2,300 mg, or 1,500 mg if desired, and to consume the appropriate amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight or lose weight if needed. Ways to Control Sodium Levels The key to lowering your sodium intake is to make healthier food choices when you’re shopping, cooking, and eating out. Tips for Lowering Sodium When Shopping, Cooking, and Eating Out Shopping Cooking Eating Out Read food labels, and choose items that are lower in sodium and salt, particularly for convenience foods and condiments.* Choose fresh poultry, fish, and lean meats instead of cured food such as bacon and ham. Choose fresh or frozen versus canned fruits and vegetables. Avoid food with added salt, such as pickles, pickled vegetables, olives, and sauerkraut. Avoid instant or flavored rice and pasta. Don’t add salt when cooking rice, pasta, and hot cereals. Flavor your foods with salt-free seasoning blends, fresh or dried herbs and spices, or fresh lemon or lime juice. Rinse canned foods or foods soaked in brine before using to remove the sodium. Use less table salt to flavor food. Ask that foods be prepared without added salt or MSG, commonly used in Asian foods. Avoid choosing menu items that have salty ingredients such as bacon, pickles, olives, and cheese. Avoid choosing menu items that include foods that are pickled, cured, smoked, or made with soy sauce or broth. Choose fruit or vegetables as a side dish, instead of chips or fries. *Examples of convenience foods are frozen dinners, prepackaged foods, and soups; examples of condiments are mustard, ketchup, soy sauce, barbecue sauce, and salad dressings. Most of the sodium Americans eat comes from processed and prepared foods, such as breads, cold cuts, pizza, poultry, soups, sandwiches and burgers, cheese, pasta and meat dishes, and salty snacks. Therefore, healthier choices when shopping and eating out are particularly important. Ways to Control Calories To benefit from the DASH eating plan, it is important to consume the appropriate amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight. To help, read nutrition labels on food, and plan for success with DASH eating plan sample menus and other heart-healthy recipes . The DASH eating plan can be used to help you lose weight. To lose weight, follow the DASH eating plan and try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Find out your daily calorie needs or goals with the Body Weight Planner and calorie chart . Talk with your doctor before beginning any diet or eating plan. General tips for reducing daily calories include: Eat smaller portions more frequently throughout the day. Reduce the amount of meat that you eat while increasing the amount of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, or dry beans. Substitute low-calorie foods, such as when snacking (choose fruits or v\nhttps://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/dash-eating-plan\nDASH diet.\nExcess body weight\ncan lead to raised blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease\n, and stroke.

{"_id": "762c8539", "question": "How accurate is a CT scan in detecting a brain hemorrhage if done within 72 hours of occurrence?", "answers": "Very accurate.\nCT scans show X-ray density differences mapped out to form an image. Fresh Blood is more X-ray dense than normal brain tissue. Therefore it is most visible immediately after the bleed.\nHere is an acute subdural on the right. You can see that is more dense (whiter) than the normal brain and you can see the compression on the right lateral ventricle and the surface sulci on the right side of the brain.\nAs the blood ages, it gradually become less dense and less visible but still can be detected by mass effect (the displacement of normal structures). If the bleed is very minimal and has become isodense with brain, it will be very difficult to detect.\nHere is a relatively large left subdural bleed that is the same density as the underlying brain but it is “effacing” the sulci and compressing the lateral ventricle. These are “mass effects” that demonstrate that there is an isodense subdural at the line. Note that these mass effects are the same as the image of the acute subdural above."}

If you have a severe brain hemorrhage that causes you to stop breathing, then lack of oxygen would injure your heart, and you could die from a cardiac dysrhythmia like ventricular fibrillation, or asystole. I can't really think of a way that a cardiac arrest would DIRECTLY cause a brain hemorrhage, but if you were elderly, and had v fib or asystole from a heart attack, and you collapsed and struck your head on a hard surface, that might cause a traumatic brain hemorrhage. Malignant hypertension could cause both a cardiac event and a brain hemorrhage."}

But there is something to be said about your extreme guilt. It is perfectly natural to feel guilty in such situations and a lot of it has to do with the enormity of the loss rather than what you did and didn’t do. So many people I know have, in hindsight, thought of something that they might have done wrong to cause a loved one’s death. For example, ‘I should have taken him to X hospital and not Y.’\nPlease don’t let this guilt kill you. It is not as if you ignored some definite symptom which you knew would cause his death. Did you know that he had such a serious problem for a few days before his hospitalization? Only then would you be guilty of negligence. When this guilt strikes you, ask yourself if you purposely ignored his problem so that he would die. Keep rationalizing this way and with time, your guilt should subside. Best wishes."}

{"_id": "011fc004", "question": "I recently had a brain hemorrhage and luckily have been left with no long lasting disabilities but I am struggling with stroke fatigue, any ideas how on how to manage this?", "answers": "First — congratulations on surviving your stroke!\nI too had an intracerebral hemorrhage. I’m glad I didn’t know until later that 60% of people die within 30 days of this type of stroke. My neurologist saw a suspicious shadow on a CT scan and went in for a closer look. He found another (unburst) aneurysm that he strongly recommended I have fixed after my brain had had a few months to recover from the trauma of the initial stroke. I did. He “coiled” the troubling aneurysm and I am very relieved that I no longer have a “ticking time-bomb” in my brain.\nI couldn’t sleep at all for months after my stroke. During sleepless nights, I read about people with post-stroke sleepiness and I envied them! Get yourself tested for sleep problems, such as sleep apnea. That can cause one to feel tired even after a “good night” of sleep. There may be other sleep related after effects of the stroke that can be addressed.\nEverything is a bit harder after a stroke and normal things leave me exhausted. Over time, I’ve learned to moderate my activity to minimize this. I returned to work five months post-stroke. I found myself working and sleeping — nothing else. After a year, I spoke with my doctors and they suggested I take a few more months off work. My energy returned, a bit. I can now function, but I can’t do as much as I did before the stroke.\nGive yourself a break. Let yourself rest apart from physical therapy and other rehab activities. You don’t say how long it has been, but your brain is likely still healing and rewiring itself to bypass the damaged areas. Healing continues. It has been over three years since my brain hemorrhage and I’m still recovering.\nCourage!"}

And by safely I mean like besides the obvious risks a typical human being would face.", "answers": "Since there are basically NO risks to taking LSD or shrooms, I don’t know what you mean by “obvious risks.” They are utterly harmless, though they’ve managed to scare the bejeesus out of the secret police and executive branches of our government (especially after they spent a couple of years slipping acid in each others’ coffee, and dosing random strangers without warning) This has inspired them to sink a great deal of money and effort into spreading lies and propaganda meant to scare people away from self-realization and spiritual awakening. My guess is that they’re afraid these folks might vote.\nI’m not a neurosurgeon, so I couldn’t say for sure. Generally speaking, I’d say the cannabis is a much greater risk than psychedelics, since some people can suffer from cannabis psychosis. I’ve been through it, and it’s no picnic. To be on the safe side, if you are going to experiment, I suggest you stick, with LSD since it’s much more predictable and does not much affect the body or nervous system, physiologically speaking. Mushrooms do have a potential for physical OD, though it’s absurdly high."}

{"_id": "768ef4f9", "question": "How are intracerebral hemorrhages possible when blood does not enter the brain due to the blood-brain barrier?", "answers": "Blood - of course! - enters the brain! The brain has a high metabolism and is dependent on the constant supply of oxygen and glucose delivered by the blood. A compromise in bloodflow to the brain leads to an intracerebral ischemia, a stroke, with neurological symptoms due to an infarction (a death of cells supplied by the occluded vessel by for instance a bloodclot). A hemorrhage occurs when there is a rupture in the wall of the bloodvessels and blood is massed outside the vessels (which is also a stroke leading to neurological symptoms).\nThe blood-brain barrier is due to special properties in the lining of the capillaries in the brain preventing larger molecules ( as some drugs) from entering the intercellular fluid and the cells. It is an evolutionary developed protection of the brain, and thus the whole organism, from toxins."}

That is when most people reach their peak function post stroke. Small gains can be made for a few years after, but usually they are adaptive gains, by which I mean they've adopted a new way to do something rather than had a massive physical improvement.\nIts not the most pleasant to think about, and we always encourage hope and effort, but its important for families to be realistic, which means planning for life as it is now (at 6 weeks post) if gains happen thats great, if they don't they can be set up at home or residential care to cope with the new functional changes."}

I have Crohn’s disease and it’s suspected that a blood clot from the intestines caused my strokes, as the MRA to the brain showed minimal build up of the arteries to the brain. A MRA of the intestines is a good precaution, as bleeds there can dislodge a clot. Only takes a 2mm clot to cause a brain stroke.\n2mm is the size of some of the smallest arteries in the midbrain.

{"_id": "642432f8", "question": "Is it possible for someone that had a car accident to have brain injury then hemorrhage?", "answers": "What I believe you wish to know is how common is hemorrhaging when an accident has occurred. Almost inevitably there will be some blood but hemorrhaging implies a much greater flow of blood. Many injuries, which are percussion in that the head has head something, will cause some subdural bleeding. Only when there is significant injury does one expect a hemorrhage. The other side of that is hemorrhages can occur within the brain with no accident or incident. Cerebral Vascular Accidents (CVAs) are a common intracranial event which often lead to ‘strokes’. But, again, there was no external incident to cause them.\nThe brain and the bleeding within it is a complicated situation. I’ve only simplified my answer to conform to the question."}

There may be no functional impairment, various degrees of impairment, or death, depending on the severity and location of the compression. Compression in the brainstem is more likely to be lethal (if it involves the respiratory centers, for example) whereas the same size mass and same degree of compression in the cerebrum might even go unnoticed.

{"_id": "0fda044f", "question": "Why aren't the mental health issues regarding circumcision given as much credence as the physical health issues (i.e., hemorrhage, brain trauma, genetic abnormalities due to stress, urethral closure leading to kidney disease, etc.) cf., Jimmy Kimmel?", "answers": "The reason is because those are all blatant falsehoods. I am a man who was circumcised at birth, and I have never in my life regretted it or wanted to change anything. In fact, I am glad to have been circumcised because it makes penile hygiene much easier. I have a healthy and pleasurable sex life, and I do not feel that circumcision has denied me any sexual pleasure at all.\nThere are a number of medical issues that I might have had to worry about if I had not been circumcised that I am entirely free of, and there are zero additional medical problems that I have to worry about because of circumcision.\nI recommend without reservation that all infant males be circumcised as I was."}
