{"_id": "bc79ff5c", "question": "When you turn off the engine of a car, at what position does the piston in the internal combustion engine stop in relation to a four-stroke cycle?", "answers": "Let’s take 4 cycle, 4 cylinder in-line engine. The crank throws are arranged such that pistons 1-4 and pistons 2–3 move in the same direction, ie both pistons 1 and 4 move up and down together; and pistons 2–3 similarly move up and down together. In such a configuration firing order could be one of either 1–2–4–3 or 1–3–4–2.\nNow this means that before firing, piston 1 would be moving up towards TDC approaching the end of the compression stroke, and piston 4 would be approaching TDC at the end of the exhaust stroke. After ignition has occured in cylinder 1, it and piston 4 will be moving down to BDC while pistons 2–3 will be moving up to TDC, one of them approaching the end of the compression stroke and the other, the end of the exhaust stroke.\nWhen you turn off the engine no more power strokes are left and the engine will slow down and eventually stop. The slowing forces are friction and the compression pressure acting on whichever piston is approaching TDC at the end of the compression stroke, since switching off the engine does not stop it from taking in air and compressing it. Of the two forces slowing down the engine, compression pressure is the more prevalent and the engine will tend to stop around two positions that can be viewed on the flywheel as diametrically opposite each other. When you dismantle the flywheel of an engine that has been running for a long time, these two diametrically opposed positions can be seen easily by teeth that have been worn with respect to the teeth at other positions of the starter ring gear; because these positions are where the engine has stopped and the starter motor pinion has to clash against. Of course this position is not an exact point but rather a range.\nIf a starter motor begins to slip when one is trying to start the engine, a garage, for a relatively cheap fix, would take out the ring gear, rotate it slightly around the flywheel and assemble it again in a new position so that fresh, relatively less worn teeth come into contact with the pinion during starting."}

Detroit has also stopped manufacturing 2-strokes.\nHowever, their engines will run reliably for quite a few more years.\nThey were used in every application imaginable - trucks, boats, locomotives, pumps, generators, excavators, cranes, buses, farm equipment, pavers - you name it and Detroit had an engine for you!\nDetroits were all sleeved engines meaning their cylinder bores were not a part of the actual engine block but rather a large “tin can” open at both ends which are inserted into the block - the pistons moved inside of , and wore, the sleeve’s internal metal surface rather than a part of the actual metal block casting.\nAfter 10,000 or more operating hours the engine would be tired and it was time for a rebuild - “put in the kit” was the trade term - new sleeves, new pistons and rings, connecting rods, reground crankshaft with fitted bearings, new cam bearings, seals, gaskets, etc., etc, …..when you were finished you had an engine back within “factory new specs” ready for another 10, 000+ hours of operation.\nDetroits were manufactured in a number of series - 53, 71, 92 and 149 - and a number of different cylinder configurations 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16. The series was the cubic inch displacement of each cylinder - a 71 series engine had a 71 cubic inch displacement for each cylinder - for example, a 6–71 had 6 cylinders each with 71 cubic inches for a total displacement of 426 cubic inches.\nMany parts would interchange within the series - for example a 6–71 head would fit a 12–71, a 3–53 head would fit a 6–53, etc.\nThey were heavy, simple, incredibly reliable, almost indestructible engines which were noisy, dirty by today’s standards, and always leaked oil.\nIt was said if you had Detroits in your boat and there was NOT oil in your bilge water - something was definitely wrong."}

He counts syllables in a word, words in a sentence, the number of pen strokes to write a word, and more ways than I can relay. Is this a form of OCD?", "answers": "It very likely is, although only a medical professional is qualified to diagnose it. Lindsey’s answer provides some excellent insight. Someone with OCD feels a compulsion to do those activities. It’s not a choice. Many people with OCD—and I know one personally—feel that if they don’t perform a specific routine, something “bad” will happen. It’s an overwhelming sense of dread. Often that dread involves others, such as parents. “If I don’t do this, something terrible will happen to my parents,” for example.\nNow, that’s not always present in OCD, but it seems to be pretty common.\nOCD often is a co-existing condition with others, such as ADHD or Asperger’s (which fairly recently was redefined as a variation of autism . . . though, from personal observation, I don’t agree.). That’s not always the case, but if your friend also has been diagnosed with ADHD, it wouldn’t be terribly surprising if he also had OCD.\nOn the other hand, your friend’s behavior could possibly “just” be a manifestation of autism. I’ve also known people with autism who “deconstruct” things. Sometimes it’s the calendar—what day of the week did a specific day of the week fall on, who was born on a specific date, etc. (Before autism was well known—back in the 1950s—my uncle had that trait/interest.) Sometimes it’s fascination with machinery. It’s possible that your friend is fascinated by deconstructing things having to do with words.\nThough I’m not a medical professional, one factor that may help define your friend’s behavior is whether he’s doing it because he’s fascinated/interested in what he’s doing (autism), or whether he’s doing it because he feels forced to, and that bad things might happen if he doesn’t (OCD)."}

And you would not want it back after it has been in another person’s body!\nTransplant surgery is pretty routine now, but someone who has renal failure and needs a transplant has likely been exposed to quite a few medications and run the risk of infections that healthy people’s immune systems manage easily - but immunosupression means their immune system isn’t doing the job. If it were, the kidney they received from you with your unique protein signature would be recognized as an invasive protein and attacked by the immune system.\nWhen the kidney was in you, that kidney was familiar to your immune system because it was made of the same proteins. After transplanting, the kidney is exposed to another person’s immune system…..and many of the similar - but not exact - proteins in your transplanted kidney signal “FOREIGN” to the transplant recipient’s immune system. In order to mute the immune reaction, we use immunosuppresive drugs. And the kidney slowly gets attacked by a weakened immune reaction - and the recipient may harbor a low grade fungal infection, or low grade bacterial infections due to the immune suppression.

{"_id": "0b6b072c", "question": "What are some stroke-related small techniques that Olympic swimmers use to go faster?", "answers": "Most advanced stroke techniques are highly contextual depending on where you are in your development as a swimmer.\nJust because a gold medalist does something doesn’t mean that it’s a good thing that everyone should be doing.\nA gallop-style of swimming freestyle is great for some people, but it doesn’t work for everyone. Not everyone is the same: The Gallop Swim\nStroke\n: Is it Faster? Should You Consider It?\nThere are several different freestyle styles you can try, see if you can find one that helps you the most.\nYou mention butterfly kick off backstroke starts and turns as well.\nNotice Missy Franklin’s nose. She wears a nose clip for backstroke. The big problem with backstroke underwaters is that you have to constantly blow air out your nose or you’ll get water up your nose. If you don’t like nose clips you have to have huge lungs to really work it.\nIn generally for swimming in a pool, some things I’ve noticed that give me a particular advantage:\nTurns. I worked on turns exclusively for a 2 weeks. You can make up body lengths on a turn. The flip needs to be fast, you can’t linger on the wall and you have to push off HARD. You need to have a great streamline and a quality butterfly kick as well.\n\nSome tips on improving your turn are here: Bart Loews's answer to What's the best technique to do a pro stylish-like turn while swimming laps?\n\nTo really get a good push off, though, you need to build up those leg muscles with squats, deadlifts, explosive calf extensions and plyometrics.\nFeel the water. With every stroke you need to feel what you’re doing in the water and maximize propulsion while minimizing drag. When you put your hand in the water the goal should be to treat it like a ladder. If you’re doing it right your body should be moving by your hand rather than your hand moving down your body. Ideally your hand will stay in the same place in the water as when it entered, but obviously, even with a paddle, that’s not possible.\n\nFeel the water around your hands and move in such a way to move more of it.\nUndulation and rotation. Backstroke and freestyle are vertical axis strokes while butterfly and breaststroke are undulating strokes. The undulation helps you move through the water, but don’t overdo it on the butterfly and don’t underdo it on the breaststroke. Most new swimmers have waaaaay too much awkward undulation and they also swim very flat in the breaststroke. Due to the nature of the stroke you can sneak in an upward butterfly kick in the breaststroke and not get called on it 99% of the time.\n\nFreestyle and backstroke have natural side to side rotation which are beneficial to getting the most out of your stroke extension. This is another example of a gold medalist doing something different that probably won’t work for most people. Katinka Hosszú destroyed the competition in backstroke but swims with a relatively flat stroke. Don’t try to do this, it’s not good for most swimmers, you won’t get enough extension on your pulls.\nExtensions. Fully extend at the end of your strokes. In freestyle you should be making a significant splash as you flick your wrist at the end of your stroke. When you first start doing this your forearms will probably feel it. You’ll be surprised how much faster you go when you start extending before the recovery.\n\nIn breaststroke it’s essential to use your kick as a platform to throw yourself forward, there’s less extension in breaststroke than the other strokes, obviously.\nButterfly kick during underwaters. Underwater butterfly kick is the best thing since sliced bread. Get good at this. Every turn should take you out past the flags. That said, the effectiveness of butterfly kick varies from person to person and depends a lot on your body composition and the speed of it is vastly overstated — it’s mainly effective because it’s used on the starts and turns, the parts of your race where you’re already moving your fastest.\nKicks. A lot of people when they learn to swim try to make as big a splash as possible. They do this by bending their legs and feet. Bending your legs is the best way to stop yourself in the water. Don’t do this. Don’t bend your knees, point your toes and kick from your hips (in everything but breaststroke). In any event under a 200 (even sometimes the 200) kick is essential to keep your body high in the water. 200 and more you don’t want to kick as much, keep a regular, slow, but powerful kick to keep your legs elevated, but kicking is so draining that over a long distance the cost benefit doesn’t exist to keep kicking so hard…only kick enough to keep your legs from dragging.\nIn the end, unless there’s something obviously wrong with your stroke, I wouldn’t mess with it too much. Play around with things in practice and talk to lots of coaches, everyone has different insights. The key is to find someone and something that helps you — not to necessarily just copy something that made someone else successful.\nMost of my advice works for the average person, Olympians are not average and are successful because they’ve found things that work for them."}

{"_id": "98755f4f", "question": "What is the best natural therapy to treat my chronic constipation, which I believe maybe related to my stroke or depression?", "answers": "This may seem counter-intuitive, but walking more can seriously improve bowel motility. Walking helps tone all kinds of muscles, gently improves circulation of blood to places like the bowels, which are really just a looong, extended sphincter muscle lined with a layer of tissue that absorbs nutrients as this muscle pushes food through the bowels.\nAnd getting little more daily exercise by walking is most often doctor-recommended after health problems like strokes. (Assuming you're already bring treated by a doctor for that.) Walking is very “natural,\" and unless you have joint problems or are extremely overweight, most can add it to their life without great difficulty. Just try parking in the boonies every time you go shopping or to work, it'll add walking without dramatically altering your routine. If you have those problems (bad joints or obesity), you should find a heated pool where you can walk in water regularly, or do gentle water-aerobics. The water helps ease joint pressure & movements, yet adds gentle resistance. You should notice an improvement in the first two weeks of daily walks.\nBetween that and any physical therapy you've been prescribed (?) for your stroke recovery, you should be improving fairly well. You can increase your fiber intake as well by substituting high fiber oatmeal (or whole oats) for breakfast toast or cereals. I also like having a quarter cup (or more) of Kashi Berry Fruitful cold cereal for my daily afternoon or tv snack. Just a small amount of this tasty treat can double your daily fiber intake. If you don't like that cereal, keep trying others, there's bound to be one you'll like.\nIf you like to cook, Fiber One cereals used to print a recipe for banana nut muffins made with their cereal which I found yummy to eat — I couldn't stop myself and my ex-husband from scarfing them down. He normally didn't like bran muffins from a bakery, either. I think their website still has the recipe, but I've not figured out how to include links in my answers yet, sorry.\nPlease note I don't work for Kashi or Fiber One cereals, I just like those best myself. And I've had doctors suggest this walking to me for this problem and tried it when laxatives, stool softeners, and enemas didn't work great for me; the doctors were right. Walking is the “miracle cure” we often ignore hoping medical sciences can offer better, but you really just can't top it."}
{"_id": "88dea374", "question": "Why do most passenger car engines have a long stroke relative to their bore?", "answers": "An under-square engine, that is, having a smaller bore than stroke allows more leverage to the crank and results in a lower revving, torquey engine. Since most people are economy minded, they drive and accelerate slower, so power is not paramount to the majority. This why manufactures do not advertise the hp of their models on prime advertisements except for the sporty performance cars they make. What is important is the gas mileage, the creature comforts and safety features of their best sellers.\nTrucks need towing and load hauling capability, and a torquey low speed engine is just the ticket. It’ll last much longer than a high rpm engine since it’s intended to move a lot of weight from 0 to only low speeds and do it quickly.\nOptimum dimensions theoretically are equal bore and stroke. But there is a give and take or compromise to this. Being underquare actually reduces the displacement of the engine thereby aiding in economy and increased engine life; a smaller cylinder will eat less fuel than a larger one.\nThere is a little known effect a longer stroke engine will have; the noise from each combustion cycle in each cylinder is spread out over a longer time interval, and produces a softer BANG each time on the power stroke, making for a quieter running engine."}

{"_id": "1644bc45", "question": "Are strokes related to ischemic heart disease?", "answers": "Strokes are mostly due to atherosclerosis. Coronary heart disease is due mostly to the same thing. Atherosclerosis is a disease that is multifocal ( touches many arteries at the same time) and can touch any artery in the body.\nNow to be succinct, there are other causes for these ischemic accidents besides atherosclerosis e.g. hereditary clotting problem, vasculitis…etc. But the principle stays the same, if it can affect a coronary artery or block it, it can affect too a cerebral artery.\nWhen plaque builds up, the artery’s wall becomes fragile. Now you need to know the the inner layer of a vessel, called endothelium, does not trigger a thrombus formation. The rupture of a plaque exposes the external layers of the wall of an artery to blood, clotting happens, as there is many chemicals that triggers it ( the same happens when you get a wound) and closes the artery further. All colors of the spectrum can be observed, from a completely and acutely blocked artery giving rise to an acute coronary syndrome to a relatively tolerated partial block to an extent, patient is happy when resting and in pain when making effort described as a stable angina.\nTo conclude, yes!! Strokes and ischemic heart disease are related to the extent that they are a manifestation of the same disease affecting arteries essentially, which is frequently atherosclerosis."}

{"_id": "ec2bcdc4", "question": "Are strokes and heart attacks related to each other?", "answers": "Some are, sorta.\nThe vast % of heart attacks (there are some rare exceptions) are caused by an acute clot formation in a partially blocked heart artery.\n80% of strokes are caused by blood clots that form on atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries (the ones in your neck that go to your brain). But the carotid arteries don’t block off; rather the clot breaks loose, goes to a brain artery, and blocks off there.\nOccasionally, the clot comes from the heart (atrial fib).\n20% of strokes are caused by a blood vessel in the brain rupturing and bleeding into the brain.\nSo a common theme is atherosclerosis."}
{"_id": "8c40caa8", "question": "Why do people with bradycardia not intrinsically have hypertension if stroke volume and blood pressure are related?", "answers": "Because, fortunately, Mother Nature is cleverer in engineering than we are.\nHer solution to this riddle not only protects us from hypertension, but, paradoxically, makes it very difficult for us to control it once we have screwed up her system.\nSo, let’s start with the logic behind your question:\nYou have assumed correctly, that, when you compare bradycardia (very low heart rate, HR) with normal heart rate, a higher stroke volume (SV, the volume of blood ejected by the left ventricle with each heart beat) is needed to generate the same amount of blood flow (cardiac output, CO) per minute.\nSimply because:\nCO = HR x SV (equation 1)\nYou have also correctly assumed, that the body’s highest priority is on securing blood flow, and that pressure is simply a means to safeguard sufficient flow.\nThe primacy of flow over pressure is quite obvious: insufficient flow means insufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients, and that creates an immediate emergency for vital organs such as the brain and the heart.\nIn contrast, elevated blood pressure only becomes a problem after years or decades of hypertension.\nAt the most basic level the formula that represents this relation is the one that you know already from high school:\nFlow = Pressure/Resistance or\nQ=P/R (equation 2)\nRearrange this and what you get is\nP=Q x R. (equation 3)\nIn the case of the cardiovascular system flow equals cardiac output.\nSo now you have\nP = HR x SV x R (equation 4).\nAnd here is the first misconception.\nThe “P” represents the mean arterial pressure (MAP), that is, the average pressure over the heart’s cycles. That is not the pressure that we use to define hypertension. We use systolic and diastolic pressure.\nEquation 4 tells you that a lower heart rate (HR) can be compensated by a higher stroke volume (SV) without any change in P, in this case MAP.\nWhich is a good thing because lower MAP is typically better than higher MAP.\nEquation 4 gives you also a hint at something else. There is another player in the game: Resistance. It refers to the resistance that the circulatory system offers to the blood flow.\nAside from resistance, there is one more crucial player: Elastance.\nElastance is the quantity that describes the stiffness of the arteries. Higher elastance means stiffer arteries means higher pressure.\nTo bring it all together, you need to know that Mother Nature has coupled the heart’s and the arteries’ functions very tightly together. We even have a name for this phenomenon: arterio-ventricular coupling.\nThe nice thing about this coupling is, that we can pack these relations into some straight forward equations, one of which also answers your question.\nequation 5: EA = arterial elastance; Pes = end-systolic pressure; SV = stroke volume\nWritten in this form it gives the wrong impression that Elastance is determined by Pressure and Stroke Volume.\nIn reality, it is pressure which is the result of arterial Elastance and Stroke Volume.\nEach of those latter two can be affected by aging, disease or deconditioning, but the body also has direct means to regulate them.\nSo, a better way to represent this is to rearrange the equation to:\nIn other words, while stroke volume is related to end-systolic pressure, a lower elastance (higher compliance) of the arteries can more than offset its effect.\nWhich is why athletes, who typically have a lower heart rate but also more “pliable” arteries than non-athletes, do not have hypertension, as your question implies.\nThere are a lot more parameters which affect blood pressure. Resistance is a very important one. But there are also blood viscosity, arterial diameter and wall thickness, and functional parameters of the heart that all determine blood pressure.\nWith so many levers to work with, Mother Nature has made it rather difficult for us to understand why somebody’s blood pressure has gotten too high.\nWhich is why close to 40% of hypertensive patients treated with 3 or more drugs cannot reduce their blood pressure sufficiently.\nPS: The above explanation and equations are a simplification of the complexity of blood pressure control. But it helps to grasp the concept and answer the question."}
{"_id": "f8f68061", "question": "How is the RPM of an actual four stroke gasoline engine related to the number of thermodynamic cycles? What would your answer be for a two-stroke engine?", "answers": "I am afraid your question is not fully closed.\nA thermodynamic cycle refers to a process where heat is exchanged in order to produce work output. For internal combustion engines the most famous cycles are Diesel and Otto. The first one is widely used with Diesel oil as the medium for combustion and the second cycle use gasoline.\nThe thermodynamic cycle demands certain changes to take place in order to produce output so lets name these as intake, compression, combustion and exhaust.\nA four-Stroke engine will complete one of these processes at the time. Hence, needs to do it on four steps. On the other hand a two stroke engine is able to complete 2 of the above mentioned processes simultaneously hence, complete a cycle in 2 strokes.\nAt this point I want to make it clear that there is only one thermodynamic cycle.

{"_id": "1fe07063", "question": "What is relation between number of working stroke per minute and rpm in single acting six and four stroke engine?", "answers": "If by “single acting six” you mean a 2 stroke cycle vs. a 4 stroke cycle, then the answer is that in a 2-stroke cycle engine the working strokes per minute is equal to the product of (RPM x the number of cylinders). In a 4 stroke cycle engine, the working strokes per minute is equal to the (RPM x the number of cylinders) divided by 2.\nThe reason that accounts for the difference is the fact that in a 4-stroke cycle cylinder there is a dedicated inlet stroke, and a dedicated exhaust stroke, while in a 2-stroke cycle cylinder the action of reed valves and the participation of fluctuation of crank case pressure allows the intake event to be combined with the power stroke and the exhaust to be combined with the compression stroke."}
{"_id": "6ef6ab7f", "question": "Can a stroke be related to the sunset?", "answers": "Both strokes and heart attacks are most likely to occur around 6:30 in the morning. A protein that blocks clots from breaking down and moving through the bloodstream to the brain and heart reaches their lowest point during the day round this time. The result is clots in legs or elsewhere break up and start circulating. If they lodge in a narrowed heart artery or in the brain, you have a heart attack or a stroke. If the area is critical to life, you may have a death.\nMy wife has had a number of strokes over the years that started early in the morning. She has a blood disorder that leads to her blood clotting too easily. Stress and diet can impact this for her. As a result she is on a blood thinner that keeps her blood’s clotting properties steady and in appropriate ranges.."}

When you have a stroke one side of the body is affected, so the smile is bent crooked with one side up and the other side down and unable to make a normal smile.\nAnother test is to ask the person to raise both arms to the same height, but if they have a stroke they will not be able to do this either.

These theories were fed to society heavily by about 2010. I explain them in the below. I’ve been fighting these theories for 20 years.\nRudolph Jensen's answer to What is wrong with saying ‘all lives matter’?\nThese theories linked below this paragraph are sexist and racist. They are leading to massive problems when applied to society that we are seeing right now. Of course, the “woke” crowd doesn’t see it that way. The theories divide people into groups based on race, sex, sexual orientation, and gender then perpetually treat those groups differently. Some are grouped into perpetual oppressors and others perpetual victims. Racism is discriminating against different races based on color of skin. Racism is dynamic and not fixed to a simplistic narrative. Academia has a LOT of power and they teach these theories to others. Those people once taught go into journalism, teaching, activist groups, and politics. Virtue signaling and getting special victim status is intoxicating as it’s a “feel good” narrative and gives power to those pushing the narrative. This type of victimology lead to authoritarianism and hundreds of millions of deaths in the 20th century through Communism and Fascism. You’d think humans would learn but alas they often don’t want to think critically. The number one problem and threat in the Western World now is adherence to these theories.\nCritical race theory - Wikipedia\nPostmodernism - Wikipedia\nIntersectionality - Wikipedia\nSome quotes from Dr. Thomas Sowell - Wikipedia\n“Virtually no idea is too ridiculous to be accepted, even by very intelligent and highly educated people, if it provides a way for them to feel special and important. Some confuse that feeling with idealism.”\n― Thomas Sowell\n“Some of the biggest cases of mistaken identity are among intellectuals who have trouble remembering that they are not God.”\n― Thomas Sowell\n“Intellectuals may like to think of themselves as people who \"speak truth to power\" but too often they are people who speak lies to gain power.”\n― Thomas Sowell\n“It is amazing how many people think that they can answer an argument by attributing bad motives to those who disagree with them. Using this kind of reasoning, you can believe or not believe anything about anything, without having to bother to deal with facts or logic.”\n― Thomas Sowell\n“One of the painful signs of years of dumbed-down education is how many people are unable to make a coherent argument. They can vent their emotions, question other people's motives, make bold assertions, repeat slogans-- anything except reason.”\n― Thomas Sowell\n“What socialism\n, fascism and other ideologies of the left have in common is an assumption that some very wise people—like themselves—need to take decisions out of the hands of lesser people, like the rest of us, and impose those decisions by government fiat.”\n― Thomas Sowell\nDo we really want children learning what’s shown in the video below? They are teaching “woke” theories in many schools across the country now. I learned about them in college.\nI am not pushing a narrative but rather I’m appealing to the reader to think critically about the narratives pushed upon society. Do not fall for “feel good” ideas with no substance.\nThe speaker below is in the UK parliament and is discussing the very issue I am writing about."}

(Like travellers experiencing jet lag).\nAccording to Chinese medical books (from thousands of yrs ago), our organs work according to our bodies’ circadian & biological rhythms. That circadian clock is divided into 12 2hr periods & each period governs a different organ. In reality we can't live the best life for our organs as we'd have to eat between 3 a m & 5 a m & sleep while we should be working. (I recently heard from a friend that he does have a friend who's practising part of it now).\nOnce the rhythm is out of whack, it affects everything from our heart, liver, digestive system, sleep, hormones, kidney etc.\nUnless the whole world changes together, some theories just remain that since it's impossible to practise no matter how good. But eliminating the time change (which originally was to benefit farmers in agriculture) can mean being kinder to our bodies twice a year."}
{"_id": "e8492e76", "question": "How is it possible to have a low heart beat (about 40) AND high blood pressure (190+)? I would have thought that both were mutually exclusive. The question concerns a relative, so it is for real. (It has caused a blood clot stroke? ) Thanks.", "answers": "Question: “How is it possible to have a low heart beat (about 40) AND high blood pressure (190+)? I would have thought that both were mutually exclusive. The question concerns a relative, so it is for real. (It has caused a blood clot stroke? ) Thanks.”\nPhysiologically there’s no reason this can’t happen. Plenty of blood moves even at a slow heart rate, so if the circulatory system has high resistance the blood pressure will go up.\nI would wonder, given the question and the mention of blood clot/stroke, whether this was not the cause of the event but the result. When something bad happens in the skull that increases pressure on the brain (intracranial hypertension), there is a response (called the Cushing reflex) that includes high blood pressure and a slow heart rate. This is typically a concerning finding."}

If nothing unusual is found, he will send you to a neurologist who should order an mri to rule out neurological reasons."}
