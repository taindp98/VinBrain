{"_id": "6687fccb", "question": "What are blood clots?", "answers": "A blood clot is a build-up of blood that has changed from a liquid state to a gelatinous or semi-solid state. Clotting is a necessary process that can prevent you from losing too much blood in certain cases, such as when you are injured or cut. When a clot forms internally in one of your veins, it may not usually dissolve on its own. This may be a completely risky and even life-threatening situation.\nTypes of blood clots:\nArterial clots form in the arteries. Once arterial clots form, they cause signs right away. Because this type of clot prevents oxygen from reaching vital organs, it can cause severe pain and serious health emergencies, such as stroke, heart attack, severe abdominal pain, and paralysis.\nVenous clots usually form slowly in the veins. Venous clot signs, including swelling, redness, numbness, and pain, are gradually noticed.\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the name given when a clot forms in one of the main veins inside your body. It is most common for this to occur in one of your legs, however, it may additionally take place in your arms, pelvis, lungs, or maybe your brain.\nSuperficial vein thrombosis is a blood clot that forms in a vein near the surface of the skin. They are not normally released or travel through the bloodstream.\nCitations:\nBlood Clots | causes | diagnosis | treatment | prevention | Symptoms\nCopyrights © 2021 All Rights Reserved by Medicover Hospitals.\nhttps://www.medicoverhospitals.in/symptoms/blood-clots"}

{"_id": "2371ae15", "question": "Can blood clots be treated?", "answers": "A2A\nYes they can, and there are a few different ways to go about it.\nThere are clot busting medications that can eliminate an already-existing clot. For example, in people who are having ischemic strokes (caused by clots), we use a medication called TPA that is literally able to destroy the clot.\nYou can also use medications like Heparin or Coumadin (Warfarin). For people who are in the hospital for clots, we frequently will use a heparin infusion to treat the clots as well as prevent new ones from forming. Coumadin is more a medication people are sent home on.\nThere are newer medications that I'm not a huge fan of, including things like Eliquis, Xeralto, and Pradaxa and their claim to fame in advertising is that they don't require blood testing. What they don't tell you is that the reason that you don't have to have blood testing is because they don't actually know what clotting factor it mediates and therefore they actually don't know how to test for it. Moreover, that means that they don't have medications to reverse these blood thinners in the event they're too effective at thinning your blood. That can be pretty catastrophic.\nSometimes you can actually handle clots surgically as well. Think of a cardiac catheterization, for example. They take a catheter, usually through your groin, and they threat it up to your heart and into the coronary arteries to grab the clot leading to a heart attack to stop the damage. There are also embolectomies (surgical removal of a clot that has traveled, aka \"embolus\") and thrombectomies (surgical removal of a clot). It's pretty darn cool!"}
{"_id": "6f805886", "question": "How does blood clot?", "answers": "Turns out blood is a pretty interesting substance. As most of us know, it provides nutrients at the cellular level and carries away the resultant waste. In addition, white blood cells and various proteins mediate a highly complex immune response to hoards of invaders that would kill us without that response. As to coagulation, it begins with platelet exposure to a disrupted vessel wall lining that results in a cascade of protein transformations resulting in the formation of fibrin, the gelatinous substance that we know as clot. The interesting thing is that blood HAS to remain a fluid under most circumstances and HAS to generate semi solid clot when the vascular system is disrupted. Without this delicate, dynamic balance of fluid vs solid, we would bleed out at minor injury, or undergo random disruption of the circulation that is so necessary for survival. That this happens most of the time is one of the true wonders of human physiology. However, there are clotting disorders, such as hemophilia and various protein abnormalities that can result abnormalities that disrupt this delicate balance. Disclaimer: I am not a biochemist, so some of the details here may be faulty but I was trained by an academic vascular surgeon who’s primary research interest was in this area."}

{"_id": "9a20b0eb", "question": "How does blood clots dissolve naturally?", "answers": "Your body is supposed to do it for you. Coagulation begins usually with platelets get ‘sticky’, form a ‘white clot’, then the clotting components get activated and they form a sticky ‘blob’ including red cells. That results in a red plug.\nThe conditions that trigger clotting don’t normally exists inside of blood vessels. When they do, clots inside the blood vessels cause problems. A cause for that is often a chemical reaction and a known one is sometimes an antigen-antibody interaction. That isn’t supposed to happen, but in some situations (like an allergy to heparin) it does.\nTo answer your question, the body has an antidote for clots. Chemicals will break down the clots. There is a blood test that shows when this is happening. (d-dimer). In Covid-19 with intravascular clotting, that is positive, so the problem is not that the clot prevention isn’t working, but something is triggering the clotting inside the blood vessels.\nThe most common problem in humans is Leiden factor V, a mutation. I cannot find any reports relating this to coronavirus, but there is one that evaluates the same clotting problem in H1N1 flu, and Leiden factor V was not involved.\nLeiden factor V patients often don’t need treatment since it is usually a problem for young females on birth control pills (estrogen makes it worse).\nExcessive clotting can be treated with hepain, hirudin analogs, and long term by coumadin or factor X inhibitors like abcixamab.\nI hope this helps."}
{"_id": "c8ea0fe0", "question": "Which vitamin is necessary for blood clotting?", "answers": "“ Vitamin K plays an important role in coagulation, better known as blood clotting. Clotting is a process that helps prevent excessive bleeding both inside and outside the body. Your body needs vitamin K in order to produce the proteins that go to work during the clotting process.\nVitamin K. Vitamin K is a cofactor for the enzyme responsible for chemical reactions that maintain blood clotting factors: prothrombin; Factors VII, IX, and X; and proteins C and S. Because vitamin K is supplied in the diet and by synthesis of intestinal bacteria, deficiencies are not common.\nVitamin K is found in some plant foods, such as leafy green vegetables, and is also produced by the body. Vitamin K comes in two forms. ... Both vitamin K-1 and vitamin K-2 produce proteins that help the blood to clot.

{"_id": "212767ee", "question": "Are the reports of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine causing fatal blood clots real? What should people that have already taken the vaccine do now?", "answers": "The AstraZeneca vaccine appears to cause a very specific type of blood clot in the brain, Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST), in a very small percent of patients under 60. It is an extremely rare condition. It is still extremely rare among those who have taken the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine, but the (very small) numbers are large enough relative to the normal rates that the regulatory bodies are acknowledging a likely connection. Those who experience it usually get symptoms between days 4–20 post-vaccination, so if you have taken AZ and are past that window, no need to worry. For more detail, please see the Canadian article I included later in this post.\nDifferent countries are making different decisions about how to react to this. The risk of this side effect is much lower than the risk from COVID-19. We accept medical treatments all the time which carry some degree of risk, because the prognosis is still better than no treatment at all. In this case, the situation is complicated because (a) the group at highest risk for the CVST side effect (people under 60) is at lower risk from COVID-19; (b) not everyone will catch COVID-19, and (c) there are other vaccines which don’t seem to cause this side effect - but these are in short supply. If a country has the option to vaccinate with AZ or suffer a COVID-19 outbreak with no vaccine, it’s better to use AZ. But where multiple vaccines are available, it makes sense to use AZ for older people and a different choice for younger people.\nThe reporting on this topic has been particularly confusing. The UK and EU were already feuding about vaccine access, and then the EU started having these cases, and the UK initially denied any link. There are innocent reasons for them to have done so. The UK began its vaccination program with senior citizens, only vaccinating a small number of younger patients, eg healthcare workers. This very rare side effect was not noticeable because most of the people they were vaccinating were low risk for the CVST side effect. However, some EU countries, such as Germany, began with vaccinating people under 65. (AZ hadn’t tested many seniors in their trials, and Germany was waiting for UK data to be convinced the vaccine was safe for older citizens.) Ironically, that meant they vaccinated younger people first, who turn out to be at higher risk for the CVST side effect. That’s why they noticed it so quickly, and explains why the UK and EU data seemed to contradict each other at first. However, as the UK finished vaccinating its seniors and moved on to its younger residents, they began having cases, too. Also, the numbers in the EU got larger as they vaccinated more people, and it became clearer it’s not just a statistical fluke.\nHere is what the UK is saying now (as of Apr 7). The UK is recommending that people under 30 who are receiving their first dose take Pfizer or Moderna instead, and is continuing to use AZ for people older than 30.\nThere have been reports of an extremely rare adverse event of concurrent thrombosis (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) following vaccination with the first dose of AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222). There has been no signal for thrombosis/thrombocytopenia following receipt of other COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the UK (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). Given the very low numbers of events reported overall, there is currently a high level of uncertainty in estimates of the incidence of this extremely rare adverse event by age group. However, the available data do suggest there may be a trend for increasing incidence of this adverse event with decreasing age, with a slightly higher incidence reported in the younger adult age groups.\nJCVI statement on use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine: 7 April 2021\nSince the start of the pandemic over 4 million COVID-19 infections have been confirmed in the UK causing more than 120,000 deaths. Over 30 million people have received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine since the start of the programme, which Public Health England ( PHE ) estimate has prevented at least 6,000 deaths in the first 3 months of 2021. Analysis of infection data since the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines in the UK demonstrates that vaccination is highly effective and substantially reduces the risk of infection and severe COVID-19 disease. There have been reports of an extremely rare adverse event of concurrent thrombosis (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) following vaccination with the first dose of AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222). There has been no signal for thrombosis/thrombocytopenia following receipt of other COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the UK (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). Given the very low numbers of events reported overall, there is currently a high level of uncertainty in estimates of the incidence of this extremely rare adverse event by age group. However, the available data do suggest there may be a trend for increasing incidence of this adverse event with decreasing age, with a slightly higher incidence reported in the younger adult age groups. In contrast, the risks of severe disease associated with COVID-19 increases steeply with age, with the youngest adults at lowest risk. There are currently no known risk factors for this extremely rare condition, which appears to be an idiosyncratic reaction on first exposure to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Alternatives to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine currently approved for use in the UK include the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines. JCVI has weighed the relative balance of benefits and risks and advise that the benefits of prompt vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine far outweigh the risk of adverse events for individuals 30 years of age and over and those who have underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease. JCVI currently advises that it is preferable for adults aged <30 years without underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease, to be offered an alternative COVID-19 vaccine, if available. People may make an informed choice to receive the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to receive earlier protection. There are some adults <30 without underlying health conditions who are in phase 1, who were prioritised due to an increased risk of exposure and/or to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to vulnerable individuals. This includes health and social care workers, unpaid carers and household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals. Acting on a precautionary basis, if these persons are still unvaccinated, it is preferable for them to be offered an alternative COVID-19 vaccine, if available.

{"_id": "fa7b2540", "question": "What are some symptoms of blood clots?", "answers": "This question is too unspecific to be answered meaningfully.\nBlood clots , where?\nClotting of blood can be a positive thing, such as in wound healing, when the blood clot forms to prevent loss of blood from an injured blood vessel, by sealing it. That process is called hemostasis.\nIt can also be positive in the case of the immune system physically trapping an invading microbe within small blood clots. You won’t feel anything if that happens.\nIt can be a negative thing when clotting happens in a heart vessel. If not resolved within a few minutes, the tissue downstream of the blood clot that occludes the vessel will die. That’s called a heart attack. If it resolves quick enough, again, you won’t notice anything.\nWhen the same thing happens in the brain its called a stroke, or, if you are lucky, a TIA (transient ischemic attack).\nBlood clots in the venous system are another problem to which Jennifer Larson has provided an answer."}

They will probably feel around for abdominal tenderness too.\nIf you are lucky, the cause will be less serious, such as infection in your urinary tract, kidneys, or perhaps stones in the bladder or kidney. You may have other symptoms, such as pain and urinary frequency/urgency that will help the doctor decide. Kidney stones are excruciatingly painful, so this problem may not seem so lucky!\nIt could be from kidney injury - sports, accident, falls - or even from a very stressful workout or intense running. This needs checking out.\nSome medications, such as anticoagulants, may cause blood to appear in the urine - again, very important for a doctor to check this.\nProbably the worst case scenario is what happened to me (though I didn't realise it immediately) - it's advanced kidney cancer. In my case, the few days where I had blood in my urine just happened to coincide with a bloody boil on my labia and I thought that's where the blood had come from. It wasn't till 3 months later when the doctor picked up high blood calcium levels in a routine blood test that the stage 4 cancer was detected.

{"_id": "8fa91e1d", "question": "What foods help with blood clotting?", "answers": "Blood clotting is a normal yet complex process which is known to prevent bleeding when there is an injury or a cut in our body. However, there are times when blood clots form in some critical parts of our body like heart, lung or brain, which if not treated in time, can cause serious complications. These clots may occur in the arterial or venous blood vessels. It is when this clot breaks and travels through the blood, it disrupts the flow of blood to important organs such as heart, lungs or brain, and can result in stroke.\nHere are 5 natural\nblood thinners to reduce blood clots and the risk of stroke:\n1. Ginger\nOne of the best ways to add ginger to your diet is to begin your morning with tasty ginger tea. Research says that sipping ginger tea is quite beneficial and may cure many health problems. And, when it comes to blood thinning, ginger is known to reduce inflammation and further relaxes the muscles. Who knew that a single cup of ginger tea can do wonders for your health.\n2. Cayenne Peppers\nCayenne peppers are power-packed with properties that help in thinning our blood. And, the credit goes to salicylates, which are found in high amount in cayenne peppers. Adding cayenne peppers to our daily diet, in the form of capsules or in the food, could lower your blood pressure and increase circulation.\n3. Salmon\nIt is said that foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon, tuna and trout are one of the best blood thinning foods. It is mainly because omega-3 fatty acids help lower the cholesterol levels in our body. Moreover, they are known to reduce the chances of clotting in the blood.\n4. Red Wine\nMany experts and nutritionists believe that drinking a glass of red wine every day may help prevent heart diseases, as red wine is known to have properties that help in thinning the blood and further preventing clogged arteries. And, we know how much you fancy drinking red wine, so don't just get carried away and stick to only one glass a day!\n5. Cinnamon\nWe add cinnamon to enhance the taste and fragrance of our dish or drink, especially when added to tea, it tastes bliss. But, did you know that it is a powerful anti-coagulant? Cinnamon is capable of lowering blood pressure and relieving inflammatory conditions. This may reduce the chances of having a stroke. However, long-term consumption of cinnamon may cause liver damage, therefore, make sure you use this spice sparingly.\nOther than the natural foods and drinks mentioned above, there are other natural foods like pineapple, ginseng, kelp, olive oil, almonds and more that are known to reduce blood clotting. However, it's important to note that these foods need be taken in moderation. Always speak to your doctor before trying anything that could have an impact on your health"}
{"_id": "8af3709a", "question": "Can you describe the process of blood clotting?", "answers": "Coagulation, in physiology, the process by which a blood\nclot is formed. The first stage is primary homeostasis. It is characterized by blood\nvessel\nconstriction and platelet\naggregation at the site of vessel injury.\nClotting is a sequential process that involves the interaction of numerous blood components called coagulation factors. There are 13 principal coagulation factors in all.\nThere are two processes that can initiate clotting:\nA very rapid process the so-called extrinsic pathway .\nSlower but larger intrinsic pathway .\nBoth pathways result in the production of factor X.\nThe Extrinsic Pathway -\nCells\nthat are normally found external to blood vessels secret a protein called Tissue factor, which starts the Extrinsic pathway.\nTissue factor binds to activated Factor 7.The TF-7 heterodimer\nis a protease with two substrates: Factor 9 and Factor 10.\nThe Intrinsic Pathway-\nThe intrinsic\npathway is activated by injury that occurs within a blood vessel.\nThis pathway begins with the activation of factor XII (Hageman factor), which occurs when blood circulates over injured internal surfaces of vessels.\nIf blood escapes into tissue spaces\n(e.g., as a result of an injury), contact with collagen in the tissue space activates Factor 12.\nActivated Factor 12 is a serine protease\nthat activates Factor 11 which, in turn, activates Factor 9 which, in turn, activates Factor 10.\nThe Two Pathways Converge -\nThe activation of this factor marks the beginning of the so-called common pathway of coagulation Factor 10 — produced by either or, more likely, both pathways — binds and activates Factor 5.\nThis heterodimer is called prothrombinase because it is a protease that converts prothrombin (also known as Factor II) to thrombin.\nThrombin has several different activities.\nTwo of them are:proteolytic cleavage of fibrinogen (aka \"Factor I\") a soluble plasma\nprotein form long, sticky threads of insoluble fibrin\n.\nIt activates Factor 13 which forms covalent bonds between the soluble fibrin molecules converting them into an insoluble mesh work that traps platelets, blood cells, and plasma Within minutes, the fibrin meshwork begins to contract, squeezing out its fluid contents.\nThis process, called clot retraction, is the final step in coagulation. It yields a resilient\n, insoluble clot that can withstand the friction of blood flow."}

{"_id": "23bfe49b", "question": "How do doctors diagnose blood clots?", "answers": "Doctors suspect clots by weighing risk factors like age, cancer, recent illness, and immobility as well as symptoms like swollen limbs or the sudden onset of trouble breathing or chest pain. Physical exam findings like one sided leg swelling or the LACK of other findings to explain trouble breathing raise the suspicion. Then tests are ordered: a d dimer blood test looks for evidence of recent clotting, and can exclude clots if the patient is low probability for having one. But often the test is an ultrasound of a limb or a CT scan of the chest looking for clots in the lung. Clots can also show up on nuclear medicine scans like a V/Q scan which shows patchy blood flow in lungs with clots in them (these tests are less precise than CT scans so they're rarely used, unless a person can't receive iodine based contrast for a CT or sometimes to plan certain lung surgeries). An MRI or clots can appear on a heart echo too. The odder the clot the more non standard the test to find it: Sagittarius sinus thrombosis of the brain is rare and would be detected mostly on MRI. Clots are also rare in the vena cava but a CT could see one.\nThe test of choice for blood clots, particularly of the lung, USED to be an angiogram, in which dye was injected directly into blood vessels near the suspected clot and x-rays taken. Because this is invasive and has been made unnecessary by CT scans, it's almost never done now.\nOccasionally clots are not suspected but are found \"incidentally\" on scans done for other reasons. A common example is a cancer follow up scan which shows an asymptomatic clot; cancer patients are prone to clots and get a lot of scans."}
{"_id": "51cbbd27", "question": "How do I resolve a blood clot?", "answers": "There are several types of drugs that will dissolve clots. The one that is used most urgently is heparin. It comes in a number od different molecular weights and can either prevent the fibrinogens from forming clots in the first place, or actually separate the molecules of the blood cells from each other. It is given as an injection or IV. There are other drugs that can do the same that can be given orally. I am currently receiving treatment for a DVT in my leg and am taking one or the oral drugs. I was hospitalized for two days with IV heparin when it was discovered, then released to home with the oral drug. It will take a total of 6 to 7 months to safely dissolve the clot without breaking it into small clots that could travel to my lungs or brain( a really, really bad idea)."}
{"_id": "e8c03c80", "question": "What does blood contain that is necessary for blood clotting?", "answers": "Here’s a helpful diagram from Merck Manuals:\nWhen an injury causes a blood vessel wall to break, platelets (in the blood) are activated. They start out as spherical-shaped, but change to spiny-shaped when activated so they can stick to the broken blood vessel wall and each other, starting to plug the wound. The platelets also interact with other proteins in the blood to form what is known as fibrin (made from thrombin), which functions almost as a net to entrap more platelets and blood cells to create the clot itself. As the blood vessel heals, the clot is slowly dissolved. Hope this helps!"}
{"_id": "24c7deba", "question": "What are the risk factors for forming blood clots?", "answers": "‘Internal factors (those related to the person’s physical make-up) have 2 conditions that come to mind. The first is important: Leiden factor 5. This genetic condition makes the blood easier to form clots (thrombophilia). It’s presence is not readily apparent, but can be found on a blood test. It is a larger problem for females, as it is aggravated by estrogen. It often is first apparent after stating blood control pills. A rare condition is thrombocytosis; too many platelets in the blood.\nExternal factors are mostly mechanical. Blood tends to clot when it is moving slowly.

If the affect important areas, for instance a clot in one of the coronary arteries, it can, if large enough cause death because it causes the heart muscle to die. It the clot is large enough it will cause death. But a smaller clot would cause a coronary thrombosis (what caused it or the more modern term ‘myocardial infarction - meaning death of myocardial tissue.\nAn embolism is also a clot but this one can be moved so can affect different places in the body. The bigger the clot the moredamage occurs in the area where the embolism gets stuck, because it it too big to pass down narrowing arteries. This means the damage can occurs anywhere in the body. Common sites are limbs, for example in the leg, the area of the limb affected will depend on the size of the clot. This outcome would lead to to gangrene and may require ampution. If a clot moves to the brain then the result would be a cebro-vascular accident or more commonly called a stroke. The clot has caused the area supplied by the blocked artery to die. The affects of such an eccentric could be mild or fatal. But often the person suffers loss of mobility on one side, partial blindness, loss of speech, loss of understanding, - the result depends on what part of the brain is affected.\nAn embolism, depending on it size, could cause a minor problem, or severe disability, or losing the ability to speak and be understood. But it can also be immediately fatal.\nThe affects of the disability a thrombosis can cause can, and often are life changing.

If the patient is on birth control pills, they are stopped immediately. Testosterone supplements can also thicken blood.\nConditions\nInactivity\nGood circulation depends on good movement. Every year, people who never had a blood clot before wind up with one from riding in an airplane with their legs down and moving very little. Patients hospitalized and suddenly inactive, even patients who go to surgery are at risk of blood clots.\nHigh levels of cholesterol and tricylerides (fats) can build up plaque inside blood vessels, making them more narrow inside, less slippery and less elastic and therefore more prone to the development of a blood clot.\nThis time of year, we see the snow shovelers’ heart attack. This is generally a person with high cholesterol and high tricycle levels, often out of shape who goes out in the cold to shovel which causes the body to use a lot of energy both to stay warm AND to move all that snow. A blood clot breaks loose from inside one of those not-so-smooth-inside blood vessels, travels to the tiny coronary vessels feeding the ever active heart muscle and WHAM, they have a heart attack."}
{"_id": "f869c170", "question": "Why would a vaccine cause blood clots?", "answers": "Your question suggests that ALL vaccines cause blood clotting. That is definitely not true. You might MEAN to ask why one vaccine, the Astra Zeneca Covid vaccine causes blood clots. Currently, it is still an open question whether it does, or if the clots are a result of ascertainment bias and correlation.\nBut let’s say there is a relationship between this ONE vaccine and an extremely rare side effect of an unusual clotting disorder coupled with thrombocytopenia. What might be the explanation? During normal infections, Adenoviruses associate with coagulation factor X, and this helps them to hide from the immune system. Now we know that people who get colds aren’t dying from systemic clotting every winter, so it seems that the human adenoviruses that most vaccines are based on have figured out how to coexist peacefully with humans.\nProblem: The adenovirus that the Astra Zeneca vaccine is based on is a chimp virus that humans in Africa do not seem to have ever seen, based on what antibodies they have in their blood. Is it possible that the chimp virus proteins when administered in large amounts trigger an immune induced clotting reaction in a small number of people? I have to say its plausible. But we don’t know."}

A larger blood clot in a critically important blood vessel causes symptoms that depend upon whether the clot is in an artery or a vein, and in which part of the body. Symptoms could include swollen leg, chest pain, breathlessness, weakness, blindness, unconsciousness, death. If you’re lucky the blood clot disperses before any permanent damage is done."}

{"_id": "6b6299b6", "question": "Why doesn’t menstrual blood clot?", "answers": "There are some differences between normal and menstrual blood. The major one is the presence of anticoagulants in the menstrual blood.\nThe body produces and releases anticoagulants during menstruation to stop the blood from clotting. However if the rate of flow is above the normal limits, then there is a chance that the anticoagulants may not have enough time to work properly and there may be bright red or dark blood clots.\nBlood clots are most of the times physiological or normal but it may also be a warning sign of problamatic pregnancy. It can happen after a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or other pregnancy related problems."}
{"_id": "d9dba5d4", "question": "Does eating ice cause blood clots?", "answers": "No, why?\nFrom the Mayo Clinic website Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\nMany factors can increase your risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and the more you have, the greater your risk. Risk factors for DVT include:\nInheriting a blood-clotting disorder. Some people inherit a disorder that makes their blood clot more easily. This inherited condition may not cause problems unless combined with one or more other risk factors.\nProlonged bed rest, such as during a long hospital stay, or paralysis. When your legs remain still for long periods, your calf muscles don't contract to help blood circulate, which can increase the risk of blood clots.\nInjury or surgery. Injury to your veins or surgery can increase the risk of blood clots.\nPregnancy. Pregnancy increases the pressure in the veins in your pelvis and legs. Women with an inherited clotting disorder are especially at risk. The risk of blood clots from pregnancy can continue for up to six weeks after you have your baby.\nBirth control pills or hormone replacement therapy. Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) and hormone replacement therapy both can increase your blood's ability to clot.\nBeing overweight or obese. Being overweight increases the pressure in the veins in your pelvis and legs.\nSmoking. Smoking affects blood clotting and circulation, which can increase your risk of DVT.\nCancer. Some forms of cancer increase the amount of substances in your blood that cause your blood to clot. Some forms of cancer treatment also increase the risk of blood clots.\nHeart failure. People with heart failure have a greater risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism. Because people with heart failure already have limited heart and lung function, the symptoms caused by even a small pulmonary embolism are more noticeable.\nInflammatory bowel disease. Bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, increase the risk of DVT.\nA personal or family history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (PE). If you or someone in your family has had DVT or PE before, you're more likely to develop DVT.\nAge. Being over age 60 increases your risk of DVT, though it can occur at any age.\nSitting for long periods of time, such as when driving or flying. When your legs remain still for many hours, your calf muscles don't contract, which normally helps blood circulate. Blood clots can form in the calves of your legs if your calf muscles aren't moving for long periods"}
{"_id": "eae519bf", "question": "Why are white blood clots passed through menstruation?", "answers": "Causes of menstrual clots\nDuring menstruation, the endometrial cells that line the uterus strip away and leave the body.\nAs this happens, the body releases proteins that cause the blood in the uterus to coagulate. This coagulation prevents the blood vessels in the uterine lining from continuing to bleed.\nThe blood that the body has already shed also contains these coagulation proteins.\nWhen the flow is most substantial, the coagulation proteins within the blood may start to clump together, resulting in menstrual clots.\nThis generally occurs when menstrual blood pools in the uterus or vagina before leaving the body.\nPossible health conditions\nAlthough it is normal to have clots in the blood during menstruation, this symptom can sometimes signal a medical issue. It is advisable to seek medical advice if the clots:\nare larger than a quarter in size\nare very frequent\noccur with an abnormally heavy flow that requires a person to change their pad or tampon at least every 1–2 hours\noccur with significant pain\nThe following conditions may cause abnormal menstrual clots:\nUterine polyps or fibroids\nA blockage in the uterus may stop it from contracting as it should, meaning that it cannot force the blood out as quickly as usual. The blood will leave the body more slowly so it will have more time to pool and form clumps.\nThe blockage can also cause a heavier flow, which results in more blood pooling.\nBlockages may occur as a result of growths in the uterus. These include uterine polyps and fibriods, which are not cancerous but can cause other health issues without proper management.\nUterine polyps and fibroids consist of either endometrial or muscular tissue that grows in the uterine wall. They can cause symptoms such as:\npersistent lower backpain\npain during sex,\nfeeling bloated\nfertility issues\nirregular spotting\nEndometriosis\nEndometriosis can cause painful and heavy periods.\nEndometriosis is a condition that causes the tissues of the uterine lining to grow outside of the uterus.\nThis abnormality can lead to several symptoms, which may be worse around the time of menstruation.\nSymptoms of endometriosis often include:\npain and cramping in the pelvis or lower back\nvery heavy periods, or menorrhagia\npainful periods, or dysmenorrhea\ndiscomfort or pain during sex\nfertility issues\nAdenomyosis\nIn people with adenomyosis, the uterine lining grows into the muscular wall of the uterus.\nThis can make the endometrial lining and uterine wall much thicker, which can lead to a much heavier flow during a period.\nAs a result, it is more likely that blood clots will appear in the menstrual blood.\nHormonal imbalances\nThe balance of hormones in the body is essential for maintaining a healthy uterus.\nIf the levels of specific hormones become unbalanced, many issues can occur, including heavy menstruation or clotting.\nPregnancy loss\nDuring a miscarriage, or pregnancy loss, a person will usually pass a number of large clots, depending on the stage of the pregnancy.\nPregnancy loss can sometimes occur before a person knows that they are pregnant, so they may mistake an early miscarriage for a regular menstrual cycle.\nEnlarged uterus\nAfter pregnancy, a person’s uterus often remains somewhat larger than it was before. An enlarged uterus can also be due to structural issues, such as fibroids.\nThere will be additional space for the blood to pool in, which could lead to further clotting before it exits the body.\nBleeding disorders\nSome bleeding disorders may be responsible for heavy menstrual flow, as they can affect the coagulation proteins that the uterine lining needs to stop menstrual bleeding.\nDisorders such as platelet function disorder or von Willebrand’s disease (VWD) may cause abnormally heavy menstruation."}

Nothing I can say will change that, so until you do, I want you to do it safely. DO change needles as often as possible. If you can’t change them every time, at least squirt bleach through them 3 or 4 times. DON’T use the needles after they’re dull. This can lead to tearing the skin which makes you more susceptible to infection. DO rinse your cooker when you’re done. Reusing a dirty cooker doesn’t add anything to the shot, and you may be injecting contaminants that can hurt you.

{"_id": "3b136490", "question": "What causes blood clots in the heart?", "answers": "There are two main types of blood clots in the heart. clots that form in the heart itself, or clots that travel via the veins from other locations in the body (eg Deep Vein Thrombosis). In addition to this some conditions thicken or change the consistency of the blood making clotting more likely (cancer, leukemia, diabetes, atherosclerosis, inflammation, dehydration, infection), and some people are born with genetic predisposition to clotting problems or problems that affect the smoothness of the inner lining of the circulatory system making clotting more likely for them even when they are healthy (eg clotting disorders like Factor V Leiden, Connective Tissue disorders).\nClots that form in the Heart\nTo oversimplify, the situation, clots that form in the heart itself usually do so because the blood in not flowing ideally, or there is lose of smoothness of the lining of the heart or major blood vessels, or foreign matter there that acts as a catalyst for blood clot formation.\nForeign Material, or rough surfaces providing focus for clot formation\nThings like faulty heart valves, scar tissue or artificial heart valves, or vegetations (sticky clot bits) on valves from infection (from dental problems or IV drug use for example), can encourage clots to form within the chambers of the heart itself. Foreign materials from medical interventions, like central venous lines, PICC lines and other cardiac catheters can also provoke a blood clot within the heart itself.\nBlood flow problems or abnormalites leading to clot formation\nIf there is an electrical or conduction problem with the heart, and it does not beat in a well coordinated way, there can be areas within the heart where blood can be relatively stagnant, and clots form, (atrial fibrillation is an example of a heart rhythm problem that affects blood flow, and can lead to blood pooling and not flowing well in parts of the atria), in the heart. likewise clot formation in the heart is likely after/during a heart attack, when blood flow is abnormal or may stop altogether for a while.\nClots that form in the heart can effect the efficiency of the heart, or dislodge, and travel to block circulation in any part of the body, causing problems like strokes (clot material travelled to brain)\nClots that form outside the Heart\nMany factors can contribute to clots forming outside of the heart, particularly related to blood flow, foreign matter, genetic susceptibility, injury or provokation by an illness or condition. Deep vein thrombosis is one common example. Things like airplane flights or bedrest when recovering from surgery , can mean there is little movement, blood pools and clots are more likely to form. Medical interventions, the insertion and use of cannulas, and central lines add foreign material to the bloodsteam and can be the focus for clot formation. Many illnesses and conditions can contribute to cardiovascular disease.\nDVT and Embolisms\nPieces of blood clots in large deep veins can break off, and travel through the great veins back to the heart. A broken piece of a clot that travels is called an embolus (or multiple is emboli). A pulmonary embolism is a life threatening complication that can occur after a deep vein thrombus… this is a piece of clot from a DVT that travels to the heart, and is pumped by the heart into the circulatory system of the lungs, blocking circulation and oxygenation downstream from the clot.\nClots that form in blood vessels that supply the heart.\nAnother major category of blood clot problems related to the heart, but not strictly in the heart chambers, is the blockages of arteries that supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart. This is referred to as coronary artery disease, where the walls of the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply the heart), are thickened or scarred with things like cholesterol deposits in plaque. The thickened irregular walls of the blood vessels can restrict or affect blood flow to the heart, and even provoke the formation of a blood clot. Medical interventions like stents and Coronary Artery Bypass surgery can be used to get through or around blockages, to restore blood flow to the muscles of the heart."}

Anyone can develop superficial thrombophlebitis, but females are affected more than males.\nAs clots/bruises heal, usually within 2 to 4 weeks, they often turn colors, including purplish black, reddish blue, or yellowish green. Sometimes the area of the bruise spreads down the body in the direction of gravity. A bruise on a leg usually will take longer to heal than a bruise on the face or arms.\nCheers!"}

{"_id": "c3cc80c1", "question": "Why doesn't blood clot in blood vessels normally?", "answers": "Blood coagulation starts when vessel wall is damaged! There is collagen layer beneath the endothelium which triggers coagulation cascade through a mechanism known as intrinsic mechanism. Plus, tissue factor (a clotting factor, a protein molecule which is required for clotting) enters circulation through damaged blood vessel. This factor triggers clotting mechanism through one more way known as extrinsic mechanism.\nNormally, the collagen layer is not exposed to inside of the vessel. This fact together with smooth endothelial surface and flow of blood keeps blood from clotting. (that's very short summary of a long process of coagulation!)"}

A small clot in someone with lungs riddled with emphysema will have more of an impact than a similar clot in a health set of lungs!\nIn patients at the milder end of the spectrum, with normal vital signs, good home social situation and a low risk of mortality (calculated using systems such as the PESI score), outpatient management is entirely appropriate - that is, anticoagulation at home (either oral or injectable). The evidence we have suggests that in low risk patients, hospital stay is unnecessary, and does not improve outcomes. If however, there are clinical signs suggesting a more serious illness, a hospital stay would be indicated - for treatment and observation.\nWith DVT, again it depends on illness - more often than not though, it would be managed at home. The only exceptions I can think of would be for patients who can’t take blood thinners due to high bleeding risk (and thus require filter insertion to prevent clots breaking off and travelling to the lung), or who can’t walk and have no support at home.\nHope that helps!"}

{"_id": "3bbe4bb2", "question": "Are microchips the reason for death from blood clots in vaccines?", "answers": "Not really.\nAbout 40 years ago, I was working for the CIA, conducting experiments on inserting microchips into flu vaccines for the Alien Overlord from the supernova Cygnus-X, who I will refer to from now on as AOC.\nIn those days, the microchips were so large that you could see them in the vaccine bottles, so we were not able to do what AOC wanted. So we asked Bill Gates to help, and in return for us supplying him with sex slaves, he was able to help us get the chips to be small enough so that they were not noticed.\nPart of my job was on working on the method of programming the chips once they were inserted. As you may know from getting your pet microchipped, this is usually done before injection, but we had no instructions from AOC at the time what she wanted us to program the chips for.\nI was able to come up with a clever way of programming the “flash memory” on the chip, using a compact high frequency microwave generator that would “burn” in the code, in much the same way as we program ROM (read only memory) with ultraviolet light.\nBut it took a while before AOC was confident enough in our ability to get the vast majority of Americans vaccinated for some “fake virus”. So for the most part, our initial experiments were just getting the chips in, unprogrammed, waiting to be “flashed” with the microwave imprinter.\nNow as you may know with the microchips used for household pets, even though these chips are very large in comparison, and do not cause blood clotting. And that is because once they are in the body, there are no more blood clotting issues once the entry is healed up.\nSo I can assure you that there is no danger of blood clotting from the microchip itself. The danger is only when the candidate is selected for “programming” and someone is able to get close enough to the microchip to place the microwave “imprinter” on the skin, to program the chip below.\nOne of the things I worked on, for the Deep State Department, in the CIA, was a way of getting the imprinter to work without the candidate knowing about it at the time. I already knew that the easiest way to do this was as part of a mass operation at airports, forcing people to go through a “scanner” so that they could be imprinted, so that the imprinter could be remotely engaged, as part of the scanner “process”.\nI had then left the CIA by the time they arranged to have the World Trade Center destroyed in “fake terrorist attacks” but someone I knew still at the CIA warned me about the attacks, so i was able to warn my sister, who would have been there on that day if I had not told her about it.\nSince by then I had myself been programmed by AOC, I watched the events of 9–11 on a computer screen, with tears of laughter running down my cheeks. Or at least AOC thought I was laughing.\nSince then, the technology has proved itself.\nThe Patriot Act resulting from 9–11 made it possible for the Deep State to automatically program anyone who had a flu vaccination, and every child who had an MMR vaccination, whenever they came through a US airport and went through the “scanners”.\nThis already made it possible to elect Hussein Obama as president, as by then enough Americans had been programmed.\nBecause of all the confusion caused by the evil Obamacare, the private health insurance companies who are responsible for the excellent medical care that Americans get, did not notice the increase in blood clotting caused by the “scanners” when they programmed the microchips.\nBut the United States still needed a way of getting more Americans to get a fake vaccination. The initial attempt by the Chinese, with their first fake virus (SARS) did not get any Americans vaccinating for it.\nBut the second time around, the Chinese were able to create a fake virus in a lab, that only killed American citizens. I believe they were personally rewarded by AOC with sex slaves, supplied by Bill and Melinda Gates from the third world, and pizza, supplied by Joe Biden’s sex slave operation in Washington.\nThis made is possible for enough Americans to get injected with the microchips, where in many of the places they were programmed at the same time, so that Joe Biden could be elected president, even though he still had to use dead people to vote.\nAnd as I know from my own work on this, very often the “microwave based” programming would result in blood clotting, because it was done too fast and was still an experimental technology that altered DNA.\nAnother side effect was that some people who supported the REAL president were manipulated by AOC and their programming to attack Congress, and to say that they wanted to kill AOC, so that she could pretend that she was afraid of them being only a third of a mile away down a corridor from her office.\nBut the simple fact is that it is not the microchips themselves that cause the blood clotting, but the microwaves used to program them.\nAnd if you believed any of this, you are even more stupid and ignorant than the person who asked the question."}

{"_id": "fa29c880", "question": "Which vitamin is helpful in delaying blood clotting?", "answers": "Vitamin K is used by the body to help blood clot. Warfarin (Coumadin) is used to slow blood clotting. By helping the blood clot, vitamin K might decrease the effectiveness of warfarin (Coumadin).\nVitamin K helps to make various proteins that are needed for blood clotting and the building of bones. Prothrombin is a vitamin K-dependent protein directly involved with blood clotting. Osteocalcin is another protein that requires vitamin K to produce healthy bone tissue."}
