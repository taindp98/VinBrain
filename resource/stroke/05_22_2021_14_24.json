{"_id": "90589e28", "question": "What is blood pressure?", "answers": "I have answered this question. Part of it I am rewriting here.\nOne must understand blood pressure in simplest form for which doctors have no time to explain. \"Pressure on arterial walls is blood pressure \" why it increases?Following could be attributed to high blood pressure\n1. Cholesterol gets deposited on arterial walls,causing narrowing of arteries and reducing available space for blood flow thereby increasing pressure on arterial walls.\n2. Hardening of arteries. Cholesterol deposition and ageing process causes hardening of arteries,known as atherosclerosis.Arteries loose it's natural elasticity resulting in high BP.\n3. Water retention. It's caused by some medical conditions like kidney problems etc.,commonest cause of water retention is access salt and alcohol intake. In both the conditions blood volume increases which in turn raises blood pressure.\n4. Constriction of arteries. It's caused mainly due to stress,smoking or intake of nicotine. When arteries are constricted blood pressure increases.\nWhen one takes medicine it gives relief of symptoms by relaxing arteries or by reducing heart rate or its force but does not eliminate underlying causes discussed above and one gets feeling of cured and continues with unchanged life style, harbouring disease in perpetuity."}

{"_id": "239f4d0f", "question": "Why is 120/80 considered normal blood pressure? What's the logic behind 120 and 80? Is that value normal at any age, or does \"normal\" change?", "answers": "The premise of this question is wrong.\n120/80 is the common cut-off for when you need to start to worry about your blood pressure. Though blood pressures slightly higher than 120/80 are considered normal as well.\nWhy is the cut off 120/80? That’s the conclusion that experts have agreed upon most recently. (See JNC 8 guidelines\n)\nOkay. But WHY did those experts agree on those?\nWell. Studies that have been done. Starting with the groundbreaking landmark incredible Framingham Heart Study\n; lots of studies have been done to try to determine if there were any correlations/causations for high blood pressure and heart disease. And yes, there were. The Framingham study is very notable because it is HUGE, it is a great study design, and the first of its kind (at least in that scale). We knew very little prior to this study.\nWe now know that there is a correlation between high blood pressure and heart disease. As your blood pressure rises, your risk increases (in terms of seeing how many people got heart disease and at what blood pressure).\nBut Jason! Why 120/80? Mostly because the incidence of heart disease starts to climb at 120/80. It isn’t high at 120/80, but it is starting to raise. At systolic pressures of 130, the incidence rate becomes steeper and steeper, past 130, it’s already unacceptably higher than normal.\nThe number 120/80 is mostly arbitrary. Guided merely by the increases in incidence of heart disease from the cohort studies done in the past.\nFor your next question, Is this the value for any age? No! Not at all. Pediatric patients have their own set of recommended values, and geriatric patients have their own set of recommended values as well. Neonates have their own values as well.\nKeep in mind that 120/80 is a normal *resting* blood pressure. You can have a blood pressure at 170/110 and it could still be considered normal if you were doing a lot of running 10 second prior."}
{"_id": "09f994e9", "question": "Can caffeine increase blood pressure?", "answers": "Coffee has a dual effect on blood pressure.\nCaffeine (1, 3, 7-trimethylxanthine) in coffee is a central nervous system stimulant, which means it stimulates the brain. It causes the release of the stimulants, noradrenaline and adrenaline, in the brain. It is also an inhibitor at the adenosine receptors. Since blood pressure is dependent on the heart rate and stroke volume, as well as on the peripheral resistance which, in turn, is dependent on vasoconstriction, coffee will raise blood pressure.\nBlood Pressure = Heart Rate x Stroke Volume x Total peripheral Resistance,\nBy all indications, caffeine central nervous effects will raise blood pressure indirectly by increasing all the three components of blood pressure in the equation above.\nCaffeine (1, 3, 7-trimethylxanthine) has direct effects on the heart. By increasing the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), caffeine increases the contractility of the heart. It does so by inhibiting phosphodiesterase. The cAMP in the heart is linked to beta-1 receptors which increase contraction. It, thus, increases the stroke volume and the heart rate. Again, as an adenosine blocker, caffeine activates the heart.\nCaffeine in coffee, however, in blood vessels, directly causes vasodilation, which leads to increased urination, and this dehydrates the body. The vasodilation is mediated by cAMP, which in the case of blood vessels, is linked to the beta-2 receptor which causes relaxation. Caffeine equally causes blood vessel dilation indirectly by stimulating the release of nitric oxide. The vasodilation and increased urination will reduce blood pressure.\nVasodilation will reduce peripheral resistance, and dehydration will reduce the volume of blood, the venous return, and the stroke volume.\nAgain, looking at the equation, above, caffeine will directly lower blood pressure by lowering two of the three components of blood pressure, namely the stroke volume, and the peripheral resistance.\nMy take:\nInitially, blood pressure will rise on drinking coffee due to the multiple effects of caffeine on the brain, heart tissue, and blood vessels. This rise, however, is blunted when profound vasodilation and dehydration set in and reduce blood pressure, negating the initial rise.\nDrinking just a few cups of coffee a day, in my opinion, will not raise blood pressure. That said, high levels of caffeine, as in energy drinks, can raise blood pressure to a dangerously high level, especially in hypertensive patients."}
{"_id": "8a7bee69", "question": "Why does sodium increase blood pressure?", "answers": "Salt / Sodium Effects On Blood Pressure And Brain to kidney >\nSalt works on your kidneys to make your body hold on to more water.\nThis extra stored water raises your blood pressure and puts strain on your kidneys, arteries, heart and brain.\nKidneys\nArteries\nHear\nt\nbrain\nYour body removes unwanted fluid by filtering your blood through your kidneys. Here any extra fluid is sucked out and put into your bladder to be removed as urine.\nTo do this, your kidneys use osmosis to draw the extra water out of your blood. This process uses a delicate balance of sodium and potassium to pull the water across a wall of cells from the bloodstream into a collecting channel that leads to the bladder.\nEating salt raises the amount of sodium in your bloodstream and wrecks the delicate balance, reducing the ability of your kidneys to remove the water.\nThe result is a higher blood pressure due to the extra fluid and extra strain on the delicate blood vessels leading to the kidneys.\nOver time, this extra strain causes damage the kidneys - known as kidney disease. This reduces their ability to filter out unwanted and toxic waste products, which then start to build up in the body.\nIf kidney disease is left untreated and the blood pressure isn't lowered, the damage can lead to kidney failure. This is when the kidneys are no longer able to be filter the blood and the body slowly becomes poisoned by its own toxic waste products.\nThese five condiments top the list of salt traps:\nKetchup & BBQ sauce\nWe know that there’s a lot of sugar in ketchup – and unlike what Ronald Reagan once said, it doesn’t count as a serving of vegetables! But the salt factor in ketchup is also something to consider. One tablespoon of ketchup – about what you might put on your hotdog at a hockey game from one of those little packets – clocks in at 167 mg of sodium. That’s 7% of the daily recommended dose for an adult. For a child, well it’s not hard to do the math when most dietitians recommend no sodium for kids at all.\nMustard\nA serving of mustard, that other street-meat condiment, has around the same amount of sodium as ketchup– 150 mg. And those fancy French Dijon mustards from France don’t change a thing. Most contain about 120 mg.\n…just in case you’. It also contains over 100mg per tablespoon.\nHot Sauce\nOne teaspoon can clock in as high as 120 mg of salt –not as “hot” as one might think. But we must admit, a little goes a long way. If you like it hot, you can always try a couple of shakes of chillies into your cooking instead.\nSoy Sauce\nFinally, the very condiment that is often used to replace table salt is another super-carrier: Soy sauce. Just one tablespoon has over 900 mg of sodium – that’s almost half your daily intake! Even reduced-sodium soy sauce contains over 500 mg. How about making your own peanut sauce, or squeezing a little lemon on your food?\nSalad dressing\nEating a healthy salad? Good job! Now, check the sodium content of what you’ve smothered on top: Italian salad dressing contains 430 milligrams in just 2 tablespoons! You’ll likely use at least that. – Maybe try a little lemon , and herbs , balsamic vinegar instead\nToday’s food culture of being able to eat whatever we want, whenever we want has made it difficult for people to limit their intakes, which has led to two-thirds of Americans being overweight. Like an alcoholic or smoker who is trying to quit, advising them to just have one drink or one cigarette a day will do little to eliminate the cravings or the overall habit; it will only leave them frustrated, with that taste still in their mouth, wanting more. Giving up salt, oil and/or sugar can feel the same way for many people, a state that TrueNorth Health Center calls “The Pleasure Trap.\nSOS/salt oils/sugar\nNutritionally speaking, we do not need to add salt, oil and sugar to our food; we can get all the sodium, fat and sugar we need, and in their best forms, from eating a whole-food, plant-based diet\n. The body’s actual need for sodium and essential fats are in fact pretty low (less than the amount of sodium in ¼ teaspoon of salt a day and less than 10% of daily calories from fat), so we don’t need to supplement with any added salt and oil."}
{"_id": "dc7e6431", "question": "Which hormone controls blood pressure?", "answers": "Blood pressure isn’t controlled by a hormone, but it is influenced by several of them.\nThe biggest influence on blood pressure is blood volume, and therefore how much water the body retains. Assuming a beating heart, the organs with the next greatest influence are the kidneys. The amount of water they retain in the body, and the ratio of water to sodium, are regulated by antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone.\nEstrogens can also promote water retention and elevate blood pressure, experienced by many women around the middle of the menstrual cycle.\nEpinephrine and norepinephrine also affect blood pressure by stimulating the heart to beat faster and harder and stimulating the constriction of blood vessels.\nAngiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that raises blood pressure.\nNatriuretic peptides promote sodium excretion in the urine, water follows sodium, and thus they lower blood pressure.\nThyroid hormones raises the heart rate and contraction force and can contribute to hypertension in hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).\nErythropoietin can raise blood pressure by elevating red blood cell count; a higher concentration of RBCs promotes retention of water in the circulatory system and thus raises BP. This happens in EPO doping by athletes and can occur when someone native to a low elevation spends an extended time at a high elevation such as the Rockies, Andes, or Alps."}
{"_id": "565ed8f4", "question": "Does high blood pressure (147/85) cause dizziness?", "answers": "TOP 10 NATURAL WAYS TO CURE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE.\nI am Nancy Lopez. I want to share some high blood pressure methods from Nicole Roberts’s Twitter in the following. Nicole Roberts is a famous doctor in Miami\n1- Exercise regularly. According to Nicole Roberts’s advice, Regular exercise helps make your heart stronger and more efficient at pumping blood, which lowers the pressure in your arteries. In fact, 150 minutes of moderate exercise, such as walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, such as running, per week can help lower blood pressure and improve your heart health.\nSome exercises for high blood pressure:\n+ Go for a Swim.\n+ Take a Walk.\n+ Ride a Bike.\n+ Hit the Gym.\n+ Yoga\nUseful post: Best 3 exercises to cure high\nblood\npressure\nin 9 minutes\n2- Reduce your sodium intake.\nAs Nicole Roberts, Salt intake is high around the world. In large part, this is due to processed and prepared foods. In many studies, salt has been linked to high blood pressure and heart events, like stroke. If you already have high blood pressure, it's worth cutting back your sodium intake to see if it makes a difference. Swap out processed foods with fresh ones and try seasoning with herbs and spices, rather than salt.\n3- Drink less alcohol.\nAs Nicole Roberts, Drinking alcohol can raise blood pressure. In fact, alcohol is linked to 16% of high blood pressure cases around the world.While some research has suggested that low-to-moderate amounts of alcohol may protect the heart, those benefits may be offset by negative effects.\n4- Eat more potassium-rich foods.\nAs Nicole Roberts, As Judy Gomez, Potassium is an important mineral. It helps your body get rid of sodium and ease pressure on your blood vessels. To get a better balance of potassium to sodium in your diet, focus on eating fewer processed foods and more fresh, whole foods.\n5- Cut back on caffeine.\nAs Nicole Roberts, If you've ever downed a cup of coffee before you've had your blood pressure taken, you'll know that caffeine causes an instant boost. If you suspect you're caffeine-sensitive, cut back to see if it lowers your blood pressure.\n6- Learn to manage stress.\nAs Nicole Roberts, Stress is a key driver of high blood pressure. When you're chronically stressed, your body is in a constant fight-or-flight mode. On a physical level, that means a faster heart rate and constricted blood vessels. When you experience stress, you might also be more likely to engage in other behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or eating unhealthy food, that can negatively affect blood pressure. MediationWayAZ is the best site to learn how to stop stress and learn mediation.\n7- Lose weight.\nAs Nicole Roberts, If you're overweight, losing weight can make a big difference for your heart health. According to a 2016 study, losing 5% of your body mass could significantly lower high blood pressure. In previous studies, losing 17 pounds (7.7 kg) was linked to lowering systolic blood pressure by 8.5 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 6.5 mm Hg.\n8- Try meditation or deep breathing.\nAs Nicole Roberts, While these two behaviors could also fall under \"stress reduction techniques,\" meditation and deep breathing deserve specific mention. Both meditation and deep breathing are thought to activate the parasympathetic nervous system. This system is engaged when the body relaxes, slowing the heart rate and lowering blood pressure.\n9- Cut added sugar and refined carbs.\nAs Nicole Roberts, There's a growing body of research showing a link between added sugar and high blood pressure. In the Framingham Women's Health Study, women who drank even one soda per day had higher levels than those who drank less than one soda per day. Another study found that having one less sugar-sweetened beverage per day was linked to lower blood pressure.\n10- Eat berries.\nAs Nicole Roberts, Berries are full of more than just juicy flavor. They're also packed with polyphenols, natural plant compounds that are good for your heart. One small study had middle-aged people eat berries for eight weeks. Participants experienced improvements in different markers of heart health, including blood pressure.\n>>Useful resources:\n1- Wikipedia: Hypertension - Wikipedia\n2- Best methods: 21 ways to cure high\nblood\npressure"}

The heart pumps blood into the arteries (blood vessels) which carry the blood throughout the body. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, means the pressure in your arteries is above the normal range. In most cases, no one knows what causes high blood pressure. What you eat can affect your blood pressure.\nHow does nutrition affect blood pressure?\nCertain foods can increase blood pressure.\nCertain foods can lower blood pressure.\nGaining weight can increase blood pressure.\nLosing weight can reduce blood pressure.\nWhat should I eat to control high blood pressure?\nEat foods lower in fat, salt, and calories.\nUse spices and herbs, vinegar, lemon or fruit juices instead of salt to flavour foods.\nUse less oil, butter, margarine, shortening, and salad dressings.\nWhat are some of the foods I should eat?\nSkim or 1% milk, yoghurt, Greek yoghurt (calcium-rich foods can lower blood pressure).\nLean meat.\nSkinless turkey and chicken.\nLow-salt, ready-to-eat cereals.\nCooked hot cereal (not instant).\nLow-fat and low-salt cheeses.\nFruits (fresh, frozen, or canned without added salt).\nVegetables (fresh, frozen or canned, no added salt).Richly coloured green, orange, and red items are high in potassium and minerals that help lower blood pressure.The goal is 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day.\nPlain rice, pasta, and potatoes.\nBread (English muffins, bagels, rolls, and tortillas).\nLower salt \"prepared\" convenience food.\nUnsalted seeds (pumpkin, squash, sunflower) and unsalted nuts are mineral-rich foods that lower blood pressure.\nHigh\nBlood\nPressure\nwith E.D\nWhat foods should I eat less of?\nButter and margarine.\nRegular salad dressings.\nFatty Meats.\nWhole milk dairy products.\nFried foods.\nSalted snacks.\nCanned soups.\nFast foods.\nDeli meats.\nWhat's the difference between sodium and salt?\nSalt is mostly sodium, a mineral that occurs naturally in foods. Sodium is the substance that may cause your blood pressure to increase. Other forms of sodium are also present in food. MSG (monosodium glutamate) is another example of a sodium added to food (common in Chinese food).\nHow does salt increase blood pressure?\nWhen you eat too much salt, which contains sodium, your body holds extra water to \"wash\" the salt from your body. In some people, this may cause blood pressure to rise. The added water puts stress on your heart and blood vessels.\nHow much sodium is too much?\nThe American Heart Association recommends limiting daily sodium intake no more than 1,500 milligrams. (A teaspoon of salt has about 2,400 milligrams of sodium.) Most people greatly exceed these sodium guidelines.\nHow can I reduce my sodium intake?\nDon't use table salt.\nRead nutrition labels and choose foods lower in sodium.\nChoose foods marked \"sodium-free,\" \"low sodium,\" and \"unsalted.\"\nUse salt substitutes (ask your healthcare provider first).\nDon't use lite salt as a substitute.\nRead content labels.

You definitely need a medicine that will lower your blood pressure.\nKey points to remember\nFor some people, lifestyle changes may be enough to lower blood pressure. Whether or not this is an option for you depends on how high your blood pressure is, whether you have other health problems, such as diabetes, and whether any of your organs have already been damaged. Your doctor may also take into account your chances of having other conditions, particularly heart disease.\nLifestyle changes are just as important as medicines to lower blood pressure and lower the risk of heart attack and stroke. Lifestyle changes include losing weight, eating healthy, being active, limiting sodium and alcohol, and not smoking.\nIf healthy habits aren't enough to lower your blood pressure to your goal, your doctor may recommend taking pills.\nMost people who take high blood pressure pills need to take two or more types of pills that work together.\nEven with pills, you will need healthy habits for the rest of your life to reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke."}

This is the type of damage that trigger strokes, heart attacks and dissecting aortic aneurysms (a dilating then tearing of the main, largest artery). The blood pressure at its worst, is the number apt to do the harm. What is measured at random moments is only a glimpse of how we are when other situations occur.\nSo, when blood pressure is high, even temporarily, it places vulnerable blood vessels at risk of damage. Small vessels in the eye and kidneys getting damage lead to two of the more common consequences from hypertension: retinopathy and nephropathy.\nYour question, “Is a blood pressure of 160/90 high?” is yes. It should be a wake up alarm to investigating your health.\nHypertension is a silent killer. It is one of the leading risk factors, if not the most important risk for cardiovascular disease.

Benign is easy to treat since bp won't be very high as in malignant, leads to disease after very long time.\nMalignant is more dangerous, where blood pressure stays very high like 200/120, 230/140 and some time as less as 160/100. It's generally difficult to treat. All end Organ damage will manifest within 5 years if bp is not controlled adequately.\nSecondary hypertension is due to any abnormal changes or disease of the organs such as kidney, nervous system or blood vessel, increased amount of thyroid hormone in the blood, etc.\nOkay, first no cure.\nCan be controlled and bp may become normal.\nNatural:\nExcercise regularly.\nAerobic\nCycling and/or jogging\nYoga and meditation\nDASH diet\nSalt restriction (<2gms of sodium/day)\nFruits/veg (adequate Potassium and magnesium)\n- this is N/A for patients with end\nstage kidney failure\nDecrease dietary fat intake\nIncreased dietary fibre intake\nFluid restriction (only for patients with end stage kidney failure)\nOthers drink adequate amount of water\nStay stress free.\nStop smoking.\nTry to avoid/Reduce coffee consumption\nTry to avoid/Reduce alcohol consumption to (<20ml/day)\nBp will be maintained very well in most casses by the above methods.\nMedications:\nAnti hypertensive drugs\nSuch as depin, clonidepin, ramipril, enalopril, lisindopril, thiazides etc..\nAlong with drugs to decrease the blood pressure Drugs to control the disease that causes hypertension is also given in patients with secondary hypertension.\nPlease follow your docs prescription for drugs, taking medications that is meant to decrease your bp may decrease it too low if taken at high dosages/multiple drugs at a time.

{"_id": "39b18620", "question": "Which blood pressure medicine has the least side effects?", "answers": "Perhaps because of my inability to answer your question, I assert that you have asked the wrong question. If you look up side effects, you will find a long list for any of them. While side effects are very important, they are not a good guide to selecting the best BP medicine for a particular person.\nWhen PPIs first came out I heard a speaker address the high cost of these drugs with an implied comparison to the earlier acid reducers, the H2 blockers. “The most expensive drug is the one that does not work.”\nFor a BP medicine you want it to work, to be easy to take, to have tolerable side effects, to be affordable, to have few drug interaction, to be free of the need for laboratory monitoring, and to provide benefits beyond just controlling blood pressure\nOver the years research the guidance regarding BP medicine of choice has changed. Starting with an ACE-inhibitor or ARB or with a dihydropyrodine calcium channel blocker is recommended with the next step bring to combine the two or to add a thiazide diuretic. Examples of these drug classes are lisinopril, losartan, amlodipine and chlorthalidone.\nAny BP medicine can work too well dropping BP and causing dizziness. Most can cause erectile dysfunction.\nACE inhibitors cause chronic cough in 10 percent, and due to effects on the kidneys lab monitoring is needed. Due to effects on the kidneys they are recommended for people with diabetes. Most can be taken once a day. ARBs are similar but without the cough, but they cost more. Calcium channel blockers may cause swelling of the legs (edema), but they may help treat Raynaud's, and they may help prevent migraines. Diuretics can help with edema, but they need lab monitoring.\nThe guidelines for where to start in paragraph 4 above are in part based on what works, but also on health consequences. The chief reasons for controlling BP are to prevent stroke and heart attack. Medicine that controls BP without reduction in stroke and heart attack likely has not met its goal. Research on doxazosin, an alpha blocker, was stopped because it was triggering heart failure, but it is still a good choice if there are problems from an enlarged prostate.\nPerhaps you did not want all this, and I didn't even answer the question you asked. Number of side effects does not lead to selecting the right drug. See your family physician."}

{"_id": "effa3138", "question": "Does meditation really lower blood pressure?", "answers": "Will meditation remove or alleviate the cause of your hypertension? If the answer to this question is \"yes\" then the answer to your question is also \"yes\".\nThat of course assumes that your question has been motivated by concerns about hypertension. Otherwise why would you want to lower your blood pressure. As I have explained here (Lutz Kraushaar's answer to If blood pressure is high, what will be the cardiac rate?), blood pressure is your body's means to an end - to ensure sufficient blood flow to all organs - not an end in itself.\nSo, back to your question (and the assumption of hypertension): About 90% of diagnosed cases of hypertension have no identifiable cause. That is, your medical practitioner has no clue about the exact physiological pathway and cause behind your hypertension.\n\"No clue\" doesn't sound very academic, which is why we prefer to call it \"idiopathic\" (which definitely sounds as if we knew what we are talking about).\nThat's why there are so many different classes of drugs to treat hypertension. From beta-blockers to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) to calcium channel blockers, diuretics and alpha-blockers and more recently renin inhibitors.\nIn many cases hypertension is one of the side effects of endothelial dysfunction (ED) - the endothelium being the thin monolayer of cells that separate the interior arterial wall from the blood stream. ED doesn't happen over night. It is mostly the result of years of insult, typically from inadequate lifestyle choices.\nBut even with an intact endothelium there are ample reasons why blood pressure may become elevated.\nFor example when the lumen (the inner diameter) of the vessels is somewhat narrowed, which increases the resistance to blood flow. One way to overcome flow restrictions when resistance is high is to increase pressure. Which is what your organism is built to do.\nNow, one of the reasons why your vessels may be narrowed is a constant contraction of the muscle cells that form the medial layer of your arteries. This vascular tone, as it is called, is the result of a very complex interaction between vasodilatory (vessel widening) and vasoconstrictive (vessel narrowing) pathways.\nAnd one surefire way to give vasoconstriction the upper hand is constant stress. But, remember, that's only one of the many causes.\nIf that is the cause of your hypertension, then, yes, meditation might help you quite a bit, as long as it also alleviates your stress experience.\nIn clinical research meditation practices, such as transcendental meditation and the mindfulness meditative practices have shown some effects, but they were relatively small.\nThat, however, should not discourage anybody from trying meditation. For one simple reason: as long as medical science cannot pinpoint the exact cause of anyone's hypertension, it cannot investigate properly how large the effect of any intervention might be that targets this specific cause."}
{"_id": "92c90b6a", "question": "What causes low blood pressure?", "answers": "It is shocking but the truth is that drinking too much water causes low blood pressure.\nRecently 2 ladies reported with low blood pressure.

She continued her medicines that was the reason for slow drop in blood sugar. Her BP was 120/76.\nMobile recording of patient.\nExplanation\nWhen a person drinks too much water, most of this water is absorbed in large intestines causing excess fluid in cells. That lowers the minerals concentration in cells. So blood supplies minerals to cells and in the process blood volume ia reduced.\nThat causes low blood volume due to water not getting absorbed in small intestines.\nThe blood volume hits the lower end causing low blood volume and thirst. That is vicious circle. more u drink more thirsty u will feel.\nRead my quora profile to achieve perfect hydration levels and to become healthy.

{"_id": "babe3991", "question": "What affects blood pressure?", "answers": "The Question asked has been explained in great detail in Quora a bit earlier.\nI reproduce the answers received for your perusal.\nThere were many answers and i have selected the top 7 .\nLou Davis, Emergency Nurse, Clinical Nurse Educator\nWritten Mar 5, 2012\nThis from the National Blood Transfusion service (UK) website:-\nHow the Body Replaces Blood?\nDuring a whole blood donation we aim to take just under a pint (about 470mls) of blood, which works out at no more than 13 per cent of your blood volume. After donation, your body has an amazing capacity to replace all the cells and fluids that have been lost.\nTake red cells. Millions of them are being made and dying every second. When you give blood you lose red cells and the body needs to make more to replace them. Special cells in the kidneys, called peritubular cells, sense that the level of oxygen in the blood has decreased (due to the loss of red cells) and start secreting a protein called erythropoietin. This passes through the bloodstream until it reaches the bone marrow (the soft fatty tissue inside the bone cavities). The bone marrow produces stem cells, the building blocks that the body uses to make the different blood cells – red cells, white cells and platelets. The erythropoietin sends a message to the stem cells telling more of them to develop into red blood cells, rather than white cells or platelets.\nYour body makes about two million new red cells every second, so it doesn’t take long to build up stores of them again. What about your white cells and platelets? A number of other messenger proteins also stimulate the production of these cells in the bone marrow, and over the next few days levels return to normal.\nWhy Wait?\nSo why wait 16 weeks between whole blood donations? Well, unlike white cells and platelets, it takes several weeks for all the red cells to be replaced. There’s an important link between your red cells and your health because it’s these cells, or rather the red-coloured haemoglobin they contain, that take oxygen around your body. Haemoglobin contains iron and some is lost with each blood donation. To compensate, iron is mobilised from the body's iron stores, and the body also increases the amount of iron it absorbs from food and drink. Any iron deficiency can result in reduced haemoglobin levels, and eventually, if not treated, in iron deficiency anaemia. This deficiency can make you feel tired, which is why, as well as asking you to wait 16 weeks to donate whole blood, we also test your haemoglobin levels every time you give. We make sure that your haemoglobin level is above 125g/l for women and135g/l for men.\nIron levels\nThe body stores iron in the form of two proteins –ferritin (in men it accounts for about 70 per cent of stored iron, in women 80 percent) and haemosiderin. The proteins are found in the liver, bone marrow, spleen and muscles. If too much iron is taken out of storage and not replaced through dietary sources, iron stores may become depleted and haemoglobin levels fall. After a donation, most people’s haemoglobin levels are back to normal after six to twelve weeks. We ask you to wait 16 weeks to ensure that if you are a dedicated loyal donor who never misses a donation, we don’t risk lowering your haemoglobin levels over the long term. You can help your iron levels by eating a variety of iron-rich foods. On average men need to replace about 1mg of iron per day, women 2mg. With a balanced diet, getting enough iron shouldn’t be a problem. Foods such as lean red meat, poultry, fish, leafy green vegetables, brown rice, lentils and beans can all boost your haemoglobin. Vitamin C helps with iron absorption, so to get the most from the food you eat, drink a glass of vitamin C-rich fruit juice with your meal.\nDrink up\nBlood volume makes up approximately eight per cent of your body weight. About 55 percent of blood is comprised of plasma, of which 90 per cent is water. So although you donate less than a pint of blood at a time, almost half of this is water. That’s why it is important for you to drink plenty of water (we would like you to drink at least 500ml), just before you donate and immediately after you’ve donated. It’s important to replace fluids after you’ve donated, to help bring your blood volume levels back to normal. The kidneys also play their part in controlling blood volume by regulating the amount of sodium and water lost in urine.\nFeeling faint\nAfter donation some people can feel faint. When the body loses blood, special nerve cells in the walls of the arteries of the neck, called baroreceptors, sense that your blood pressure has dropped. The blood vessels constrict to compensate for this loss and to keep the blood pressure normal. Standing up too quickly, for example, can cause an abrupt drop in your blood pressure and make you feel light headed. Lying on the couch restores blood flow to the brain as your head will be at the same level as your heart. Sitting on the edge of the donation bed with your feet hanging down for at least two minutes will also help, as it allows your blood pressure to stabilise itself before you stand up. If you are feeling faint, our staff will ask you to stay at the session until you feel well again.\n(NBTS)\nWe medical folk have ways of classifying 'shock' due to loss of circulating volume. The categories range from Class I shock to Class IV, with Class IV signifying a loss of 40% of circulating volume (usually 2000 mls +)\nClass I shock - the first classification can occur with volume loss of 750ml and can be associated with the onset of symptoms, eg slightly elevated respiratory rate, narrowed pulse pressure, mild anxiety. It is important to avoid potentially inducing these symptoms in an otherwise well person and so the amount taken is a good percent lower than this amount.\nRobert Wolverton, Physician\nWritten Sep 26, 2014\nIt takes about two weeks to produce a fresh red blood cell, but production ramps up a bit after donation because of the drop in red cell mass, so even while losing (via recycling in the spleen) worn-out red cells during the recovery period from donation, it still takes about two weeks to replace the red cell component of blood. The lost fluid volume is replaced within hours to a day. (By the way, a \"unit\" of blood in the U.S. is about 300 milliliters, not a pint.)\nJackson David Reynolds, BS, Biology; AS, Chemistry\nWritten Mar 15, 2015\nThe renewal of all hematologic components does not take place simultaneously. For example, after donating a unit of whole blood, the average person will replenish the lost VOLUME within 24-48 hours (depending on rate of post-donation fluid intake), but it takes around eight weeks for the donor's body to replenish all of the formed elements (erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets) lost during the donation.\nTheoretically, one can SURVIVE after losing about half one's total blood volume, but this would be spectacularly dangerous. From a practical standpoint of donor risk minimization, however, the safe upper limit would really be closer to one \"unit\" (what most people think of as a \"pint\") of whole blood, or a double unit of red cells (of the same total volume), separated by aphaeresis.\nUser-10185532933882708813, I do physiology research.\nWritten Nov 14, 2013 · Upvoted by Doris Studnicka, MS Immunohematology, aka Specialist Blood Banking; Problem Investigator for Medical Devices; former…\nWhat part of the blood are you talking about? You replace the water in a day, the protein in about a week, the platelets in about a week, and the red cells not for 3 weeks or more. That last part is what keeps you from donating very often.\nHritvik Jha, 2nd year MBBS student\nWritten May 14, 2015\nOriginally Answered: How much time does the human body take to recover its blood after donating 450 ml?As an example, on average a normal, healthy individual who donates a unit of blood (about 450 ml or ¾ pint) will fully recuperate from the blood loss in four to six weeks.\nThe issue is a bit more complicated than that though. You see, our blood is made up of a variety of things:\nRed blood cells that carry oxygen from the lungs to all other tissues in the body.\nWhite blood cells that provide the body's defenses against disease.\nPlatelets, specialized cells that plug damaged blood vessel walls and join other elements in the blood in the production of clots to stop bleeding.\nPlasma, a yellow fluid made up of about 92% water and 7% vital proteins such as albumin, gamma globulin, and antihemophilic and other clotting factors.\nAnd other elements consisting of mineral salts, sugar, fats, hormones, and vitamins.\nRed blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets account for about 45% of the volume of blood in the body. The remaining 55% is plasma including the other extraneous elements I mentioned. The four to six-week period I indicated a moment ago is the time necessary to replace ALL these factors, though our bodies actually replace some of the individual components faster than others. For example, the fluid\n(mostly water) lost in a blood donation, is replaced in only a few hours, provided the donor drinks a moderate amount of water or healthy, non-alcoholic liquids to replenish the loss. The other components of the blood, such as platelets and red cells begin to replenish immediately but take a bit longer to complete; usually within a few days or weeks depending on how much blood is lost. Generally speaking, after donating a unit of blood, the body replaces the fluid and white cells within 24 hours, and platelets and plasma proteins within 48-72 hours. The red blood cells are completely replaced in 4-6 weeks.\nPat Harkin, BSc Medical Genetics 1978, MBChB 1981, FHEA\nWritten Jan 20\nOriginally Answered: How long does it take for the human body to replace a pint of blood?The lifespan of a red cell is about 120 days, so you make about one tenth of a pint per day as normal balance. You can replace lost blood quicker than that but I'd say a week to ten days to make a pint.\nAhsan Ali Amjad, Student in Surgery and Medicine\nWritten Jun 26\nOriginally Answered: How long does it take for your body to replace 1 pint of blood?Your blood is replaced every three months Body does not has any serious effect by removing 500ml of blood because sympthatics compensate for it that's why you can donate only 500ml but if more blood is lost from body then it does not take long for kidneys to reabsorb most of water and severe erythropoetin and form RBCs and restore the original volume"}

{"_id": "993af37e", "question": "Why does working out lower your blood pressure?", "answers": "How exercise can lower your blood pressure\nHow are high blood pressure and exercise connected? Regular physical activity makes your heart stronger. A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort. If your heart can work less to pump, the force on your arteries decreases, lowering your blood pressure.\nBecoming more active can lower your systolic blood pressure — the top number in a blood pressure reading — by an average of 4 to 9 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). That's as good as some blood pressure medications. For some people, getting some exercise is enough to reduce the need for blood pressure medication.\nIf your blood pressure is at a desirable level — less than 120/80 mm Hg — exercise can help prevent it from rising as you age. Regular exercise also helps you maintain a healthy weight — another important way to control blood pressure.\nBut to keep your blood pressure low, you need to keep exercising on a regular basis. It takes about one to three months for regular exercise to have an impact on your blood pressure. The benefits last only as long as you continue to exercise.\nHow much exercise do you need?\nAerobic activity can be an effective way to control high blood pressure. But flexibility and strengthening exercises such as lifting weights are also important parts of an overall fitness plan. You don't need to spend hours in the gym every day to benefit from aerobic activity. Simply adding moderate physical activities to your daily routine will help.\nAny physical activity that increases your heart and breathing rates is considered aerobic activity, including:\n·\nHousehold chores, such as mowing the lawn, raking leaves, gardening or scrubbing the floor\n·\nActive sports, such as basketball or tennis\n·\nClimbing stairs\n·\nWalking\n·\nJogging\n·\nBicycling\n·\nSwimming\n·\nDancing\nThe Department of Health and Human Services recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity most days of the week.\nIf you can't set aside that much time at once, remember that shorter bursts of activity count, too. You can break up your workout into three 10-minute sessions of aerobic exercise and get the same benefit as one 30-minute session.\nAlso, if you sit for several hours a day, try to reduce the amount of time you spend sitting. Research has found that too much sedentary time can contribute to many health conditions. Aim for five to 10 minutes of low-intensity physical activity — such as getting up to get a drink of water or going on a short walk — each hour. Consider setting a reminder in your email calendar or on your smartphone.\nWeight training and high blood pressure\nWeight training can cause a temporary increase in blood pressure during exercise. This increase can be dramatic, depending on how much weight you lift.\nBut weightlifting can also have long-term benefits to blood pressure that outweigh the risk of a temporary spike for most people. And it can improve other aspects of cardiovascular health that can help to reduce overall cardiovascular risk. The Department of Health and Human Services recommends incorporating strength training exercises of all the major muscle groups into a fitness routine at least two times a week.\nIf you have high blood pressure and you'd like to include weight training in your fitness program, remember:\n·\nLearn and use proper form. Using proper form and technique when weight training reduces the risk of injury.\n·\nDon't hold your breath. Holding your breath during exertion can cause dangerous spikes in blood pressure. Instead, breathe easily and continuously during each exercise.\n·\nLift lighter weights more times. Heavier weights require more strain, which can cause a greater increase in blood pressure. You can challenge your muscles with lighter weights by increasing the number of repetitions you do.\n·\nListen to your body. Stop your activity right away if you become severely out of breath or dizzy, or if you experience chest pain or pressure.\nIf you have high blood pressure, get your doctor's OK before adding weight training exercises to your fitness routine.\nRead more : Life Weight"}
{"_id": "7d21824a", "question": "What can high blood pressure cause?", "answers": "With my patients I remind them that Hypertension is called the \"silent killer.\" Eventually it will kill you without giving you any signs or symptoms. This of course happens over years, unless you have a major arterial rupture in the brain at a weaken area, usually the brain called an aneurysm.\nThe slow and steady ways are kidney failure, and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). The kidney is composed of millions of small hair like blood vessels. When blood pressure is high these hair-like blood vessels rupture and are never repaired. This will eventually lead to severe kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis to keep you alive. This is a 6 hour procedure 3 times a week. nothing to look forward too.\nNow for CHF. If I made you bend your arm every time your heart beat your arm would get tired, but it would not get bigger. Now if I added a small weight to your hand and you had to lift that weight your arm would also tire but it would also get bigger. If you plucked a small chunk of hear muscle and a small chunk of arm muscle you could put them side by side and not be able to tell the difference. However under a microscope you would see a slight difference in the heart muscle. So being similar heart muscle will enlarge with extra effort. Pumping against high blood pressure is generally extra effort.\nNow put your hands together as you did when you were a child. Remember squeezing those hands and causing them to eject water up \"like a clam\" we used to say. now bend the fingers of one hand outward and leave a big space between your closed hands. Now imagine trying to squeeze them underwater. Not much water coming up, right? well that is how the heart works. The heart squeezes against itself. as it becomes bigger the less it functions as a pump.\nThe athletes heart pumps say 75% out each time it beats. the Very young adult say 65%, and the functional older heart 55%. Now imagine an enlarging heart pumping less than 55%, and gradually getting to 40% You are now in CHF.\nThe average white person in America gets CHF around 55 years old. 50% are dead by 60 years old. the rest straggle on for a few years at most. No medications, no procedures, no surgical interventions. Just impending death. That is CHF.\nCHF where your output is 40% means the body's organs are not getting the blood supply they need and begin a slow process of dying. CHF with a cardiac output of around 20% and you are a cardiac cripple, unable to walk across a room without exhaustion. Our African- American population have 3 times more Hypertension than white Americans. So you would think 3 times more CHF. Not three times more 20! They can see it as early as 35 years old, yet they still die five years later.\nControl your blood pressure. Diet has a limited potential look into medication."}

{"_id": "6ce2856c", "question": "What is the reason for low blood pressure?", "answers": "There are a number of possible causes for a fall in blood pressure. Blood pressure is a complex interplay of the amount of blood flowing out of the heart (cardiac output) and the size of the small arteries (arterioles) in your body ( this latter item is known as peripheral resistance)\nThe amount of blood flowing out of the heart depends on the amount of circulating blood, how well it returns to the heart through veins and the strength of the heart to fill and empty properly. The heart rate if it is very low or very high can also affect the amount of blood leaving the heart over a extended period time.\nSo one could think of examples where there is a large loss of blood or a blood clot prevents blood flow returning to the heart or a weakness of the muscle of the heart from poor blood supply as a cause. The function of the valves in the heart is also important. If the valves are too narrow ( valvular stenosis) or if they leak too much ( valvular regurgitation), this will also affect the amount of blood that is leaving the heart.\nThe resistance of the small arteries in the body is affected by a number of items. These include activity in sympathetic nerves, parasympathetic nerves circulating catecholamines, medications and the metabolic needs of the local tissues.\nSo now to answer your question “why the blood pressure could fall “ there are a number of possibilities. It is also important to note here that the speed of change in one of the variables discussed above will also determine the magnitude of the fall in blood pressure; a gradual change may not cause much change in blood pressure while a sudden change will cause a large fall in blood pressure. There could be any number of causes of low blood pressure acting either individually or together. A large amount of bleeding, a blood clot forming in a leg in the leg, dislodging and travelling to and lodging in the pulmonary artery will decrease the amount of blood returning to the heart. Weakness of the heart muscle from poor blood supply as in blockage of a coronary artery, weakness of the heart muscle following chronic valve disease or a viral infection can reduce the amount of blood leaving the heart.\nA decrease in the resistance of arterial vessels could occur from decreased sympathetic innervation to the vessels. This occurs in the situation following administration of spinal or epidural anaesthesia after a severe injury to the spinal cord causing paralysis in the legs. A reflex from severe stretching of the bowel or the bladder can increase parasympathetic stimuli to the arteries with a resultant decrease in resistance known as vasodilatation.. In some individuals their response to stress is to faint. In this situation, it appears that the heart rate instead of increasing actually decreases and there may also be a decrease in vascular resistance . The sudden drop in blood pressure which results causes the patient to lose consciousness And fall to the floor. The described changes in heart rate and blood pressure quickly revert to normal blood pressure rises and the patient begins consciousness.\nfinally there are medications which are taken to reduce abnormally elevated blood pressure. These act primarily by reducing peripheral vascular resistance. They may also have mild effects on the circulating blood volume and the pumping strength of the heart.\nTo determine the cause of low blood pressure in a particular situation can be"}

{"_id": "101d6369", "question": "Does drinking water lower blood pressure?", "answers": "Your blood pressure can go up or down depending on your physical and\nmental state.\nIs is all to do with osmosis. Osmosis is the biological phenomenon whereby water moves across a semi-permeable membrane (eg. the walls of a blood vessel) from an area of high water concentration to an area low water concentration. Eg. suppose you put a balloon filled with pure water into a glass of salt water. The water will move out of the balloon, causing it to shrink. When there is less water in the balloon, there is less pressure on the walls of the balloon.\nThe same thing happens with your blood vessels. The more water you drink, the more fluids leave the blood vessel, causing your vessels to relax and your blood pressure to reduce. Conversely if you have lots of salt in your diet, this causes the opposite. The water goes into the blood vessels, building up pressure. If the pressure is too high, the blood vessel will burst like a balloon. This is how hypertension causes stroke and kidney disease.\nAlthough water does not significantly raise blood pressure, chronic dehydration causes high blood pressure by making the body to hold onto sodium. This increases blood volume and thus blood pressure.\nMost people have heard of the eight-glasses-a-day rule, even if they don't abide by it. Divide your body weight in two-- in ounces -- is how much water you should aim to drink per day minimum.\nDrinking adequate amounts of water can help lower your blood pressure."}

Repeat 4 more times.\nGood\nNow take a second reading of your blood pressure.\nBP measurement is notorious for being off, especially if you use one of these automatic cuff machine types. If a trained medical professional (a nurse, a physician or a trained medical technologist) is taking the b.p. reading using a stethoscope, they might get it right the first time. But if it is a home machine, then it is always better to take 2 readings, maybe 3 if you have the time.\nOnce you have your readings, discard the reading that looks “off”, if there is one that is a clear outlier. This is because sometimes the machines can be wrong.\nA reading like 150/80 looks unusual to me, because your diastolic pressure is spot on normal, and your systolic pressure is higher than expected.\nA second reading will either confirm that the first reading is valid, or it will tell you that the fist reading is abnormal, and needs to be disregarded.\nIt is always best to look at trends over a period of days or weeks, where you take the b.p. reading at roughly the same time each day and track how your blood pressure changes with the days. A little bit of +/- is acceptable, but rarely do you find an odd reading like 150/80 being reproduced time after time.\nIt is possible to alter your bp reading significantly on purpose, if you do weird things just before taking the blood pressure reading. I will not go into how to do these, because I don’t want anyone to start playing mischief with your medical professionals.

You can easily miss its initial symptoms till it gets too late to make amends. Which is why, Ayurveda recommends to follow a controlled diet and lifestyle that can keep a check on your blood pressure throughout the day. As per Ayurveda, following dincarya (daily regime) and ritucarya (seasonal regime) is essential to oversee hypertension. So, here are some eating habits you can adopt in your every day life for controlling BP efficiently:\nAvoid spicy, sour and salty foods like chillies, ready-to-eat preparations and refined flour products. Take your meals on time and avoid binge eating after sunset.\nAdd nourishing foods like green gram, wheat, carrot, flax seeds, sesame seeds, pomegranate, Amla, beetroot, red cabbage, garlic, ghee and milk to your daily diet.\nMake it a habit to consume supper early in the evening. Incorporate sweet, astringent and bitter food sources in it as they reduce blood toxicity.\nFurther, you can top up your diet with some Ayurvedic herbs like Punarnava, Ginger etc. that can lower the blood pressure and prevent its complications. Here are some easy remedies for doing so:\nDrink dry ginger herbal tea in the morning hours, if your high blood pressure is triggered by consuming untimely meals or refrigerated food.\nConsume Amalaki or Gokshura powder/tablets every day, if you are exceedingly indulgent in junk food.\nHypertension caused by stress, anxiety or intake of alcohol/acidic food can be curbed with Arjuna and Shatavari.\nFor prolonged complaint of hypertension, drink Moringa leaf juice with honey regularly. Make sure to consult your physician for getting your dosage guidelines\nBoil some Garlic cloves in milk and drink it with honey. It is a sureshot remedy for controlling high blood pressure.\nIf you find these remedies too hassling, you can also try Nirogam’s Hypershun\ntablets. It is composed of Giloy, Ashwagandha, Mandukaparni, Vacha, Mandukpishti, Praval pishti and many more BP-regulating herbs that nourish the kidney, spleen and intestine tissues, while lowering your average blood pressure readings.\nHope this helps you to manage your BP problems better!"}
{"_id": "1a993882", "question": "Why does my blood pressure fluctuate?", "answers": "1. Food Sensitivities\nSome people will have changing blood pressure due to being sensitive to certain foods. In most cases, the blood pressure would dramatically rise after eating a trigger food. This is particularly common for those with salt sensitivities after taking very salty meals. Usually, this can return to normal for a while. Yet, you many need to make some diet changes, if such swings in pressure occur frequently.\n2. Stress\nWhen we are stressed, our bodies increase blood sugar, blood pressure, respiration rate, and heart rate. In a stressful situation, peripheral arteries constrict, making the heart work harder to get oxygenated blood throughout tissues in the body. Occasional stress isn't typically a concern but frequently experiencing it can cause chronic fluctuations in blood pressure which may be harmful.\n3. Caffeine Consumption\nAs a stimulant, coffee produces a temporary rise in blood pressure. Drinking three or four cups may increase your blood pressure 4 to 13 mmHg. If you don't regularly have caffeine, you may notice more significant fluctuations. Experts don't know why caffeine increases blood pressure but think it may be due to constriction of blood vessels.\n4. Medications\nCertain medications, including over-the-counter ones, may lead to temporary elevations in blood pressure. These include anti-inflammatory meds, decongestants, and acetaminophen. You can experience worse fluctuations from illegal street drugs, leading to life-threatening situations.\n5. Adrenal Fatigue\nYour adrenals regulate multiple hormones in the body and can seriously affect your cardiovascular health. If your adrenals are fatigued due to an extended illness or excessive/chronic stress, they can't regulate your blood pressure properly.\n6. Fever\nA fever is a sign that your body is fighting an infection. Since a fever speeds up your heart rate, it increases your blood pressure due to the narrowing blood vessels. It is very common to notice fluctuating blood pressure during a fever or other sickness.\n7. Deposits of Calcium or Cholesterol in the Arteries\nIf you have calcium and/or cholesterol deposits in your arteries, they will become stiff and inelastic. This makes them incapable of relaxing and causes hypertension. This condition is most common among those who are middle-aged or older and stiff arteries may also lead to systolic hypertension.\n8. Dehydration\nDehydration can also lead to fluctuations with a dramatic decrease. You can just regain water retention to raise your blood pressure by increasing the blood volume.\nFluctuating\nBlood\nPressure"}

{"_id": "1fe34d37", "question": "How does potassium reduce blood pressure?", "answers": "Via 2 pathways (I’ll explain them in laymen terms below this list):\ndirect: vasodilation via hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle.\nindirect: increased sodium excretion via the kidneys.\nThe direct effect:\nContrary to sodium, potassium is a directly vasoactive agent, that is, it has a direct effect on the vascular vessels.\nThe cellular concentration of potassium, the most abundant ion in all animal cells, is regulated by an enzyme that actively pumps sodium out of and potassium into the cell. This so-called sodium-potassium channel (or Na+-K+ pump) ensures that the concentration of sodium is always higher outside the cell, and the concentration of potassium is always higher on the inside.\nThe net result is a negative charge on the inside and a positive charge on the cell’s outside, the difference being the membrane potential.\nIn the case of vascular smooth muscle cells any signal that triggers a depolarization of their membranes’ resting potential stimulates the cells to contract.\nWhen that happens over any length of a vessel, the vessel diameter is being reduced, which increases the pressure in the vessel.\nOur current understanding of the role of potassium in regulating blood pressure is that increasing potassium supply (though dietary means or supplementation) may lead to hyperpolarization of the vascular medial smooth muscle cells.\nHyperpolarization means that the cells need a larger stimulus than normal to contract. That is, they are more resistant to anything that promotes a blood pressure increasing reduction of vessel diameter.\nThat affects not only larger vessels but also the vascular beds of small vessels, which are the vessels that regulate peripheral resistance. The more constricted they are, the higher the resistance in the entire arterial system, the higher the blood pressure.\nThe vascular beds of the kidneys play an important role in the regulation of systemic resistance. And the vascular beds of the brain may also be affected.\nThe indirect effect:\nDietary increase in potassium can stimulate an increased sodium chloride excretion via urine, which may have a lowering effect on blood pressure in the presence of high sodium intake.\nThat is why supplementation with potassium may have an effect on blood pressure, but the effects are neither immediate nor guaranteed. Dietary or supplemental increase of potassium acts with a time delay of weeks, and may not materialize at all due to the organism’s possible compensatory responses."}

I would like to share some high blood pressure techniques from Jean Flores’s WordPress blog as followings. Jean Flores is a famous doctor.\nBEST FOODS FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE RECOMMENDED BY HARVARD HEALTH:\n1- Leafy greens\n2- Berries\n3- Red beets\n4- Skim milk and yogurt\n5- Oatmeal\n6- Bananas\n7- Salmon, mackerel, and fish with omega-3s\n8- Seeds\n9- Garlic and herbs\n10- Dark chocolate\n11- Pistachios\n12- Olive oil\n13- Pomegranates\nJean Flores also shares some useful tips below:\n1. Walk and exercise regularly\nAs Jean Flores, Regular exercise helps make your heart stronger and more efficient at pumping blood, which lowers the pressure in your arteries. In fact, 150 minutes of moderate exercise, such as walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, such as running, per week can help lower blood pressure and improve your heart health. Useful source: Top 3 exercises to cure high\nblood\npressure\n2. Reduce your sodium intake\nAs Jean Flores, Salt intake is high around the world. In large part, this is due to processed and prepared foods. In many studies, salt has been linked to high blood pressure and heart events, like stroke. If you already have high blood pressure, it's worth cutting back your sodium intake to see if it makes a difference. Swap out processed foods with fresh ones and try seasoning with herbs and spices, rather than salt.\n3. Drink less alcohol\nAs Jean Flores, Drinking alcohol can raise blood pressure. In fact, alcohol is linked to 16% of high blood pressure cases around the world.While some research has suggested that low-to-moderate amounts of alcohol may protect the heart, those benefits may be offset by negative effects.\n4. Eat more potassium-rich foods\nAs Jean Flores, Potassium is an important mineral. It helps your body get rid of sodium and ease pressure on your blood vessels. To get a better balance of potassium to sodium in your diet, focus on eating fewer processed foods and more fresh, whole foods.\n5. Cut back on caffeine\nAs Jean Flores, If you've ever downed a cup of coffee before you've had your blood pressure taken, you'll know that caffeine causes an instant boost. If you suspect you're caffeine-sensitive, cut back to see if it lowers your blood pressure (20Trusted Source).\n6. Learn to manage stress\nAs Jean Flores, Stress is a key driver of high blood pressure. When you're chronically stressed, your body is in a constant fight-or-flight mode. On a physical level, that means a faster heart rate and constricted blood vessels. When you experience stress, you might also be more likely to engage in other behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or eating unhealthy food, that can negatively affect blood pressure.\n7. Lose weight\nAs Jean Flores, If you're overweight, losing weight can make a big difference for your heart health. According to a 2016 study, losing 5% of your body mass could significantly lower high blood pressure. In previous studies, losing 17 pounds (7.7 kg) was linked to lowering systolic blood pressure by 8.5 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 6.5 mm Hg (28Trusted Source).\n8. Try meditation or deep breathing\nAs Jean Flores, While these two behaviors could also fall under \"stress reduction techniques,\" meditation and deep breathing deserve specific mention. Both meditation and deep breathing are thought to activate the parasympathetic nervous system. This system is engaged when the body relaxes, slowing the heart rate and lowering blood pressure.\n9. Cut added sugar and refined carbs\nAs Jean Flores, There's a growing body of research showing a link between added sugar and high blood pressure. In the Framingham Women's Health Study, women who drank even one soda per day had higher levels than those who drank less than one soda per day. Another study found that having one less sugar-sweetened beverage per day was linked to lower blood pressure.\n10. Eat berries\nAs Jean Flores, Berries are full of more than just juicy flavor. They're also packed with polyphenols, natural plant compounds that are good for your heart. One small study had middle-aged people eat berries for eight weeks. Participants experienced improvements in different markers of heart health, including blood pressure.\nUseful resource:\n-Wikipedia: Hypertension - Wikipedia\n-21 ways to cure high\nblood\npressure"}

{"_id": "32c1ee8b", "question": "Is stress the cause of high blood pressure?", "answers": "STRESS! A phenomenon that you suffer from during your daily hustle owing to a haphazard work-pressure, unbalanced schedule without any ME-time! Often, we want to take a break, we want to escape the exhaustion but there’s no beating that as you grow to take more responsibilities, both professionally and personally. Having said that, we are all aware of the impacts that stress has on us, including poor physical, mental and social health. Today, we shall primarily talk about stress and its consequences which include chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes. But first, let’s get to know the effects of stress on our health.\nHow Can Stress Affect Your Health?\nStress develops over time. Be it a haphazard schedule, over due work load or personal problems - anything that worries you, becomes a part of mental health and the same goes for your physical health when you are constantly hustling to make your mark. The cause can be whatever depending upon your lifestyle, but the impact remains grave.\nHaving a stressed schedule can deteriorate your mental health and can affect your hormonal balance. It can also promote high levels of cortisol which can affect your physical health as well. Poor mental health can affect your physical health as well and can lead to grave disorders for a lifetime including hypertension and diabetes as it affects your internal physique massively.\nIs Hypertension A Consequence of Stress?\nIn the majority of cases, yes! Heavy stress can affect your hormones and can affect the blood circulation as it tampers with your heart rate and respiration rate. As a consequence, the blood pressure elevates and when it becomes a regular part of your life, it takes up the shape of chronic hypertension which in turn remains there for life. This condition is known as Hypertension where your body has high blood pressure throughout its blood vessels and should be regularly managed to avoid consequences like a cardiac attack and neuromuscular damage with stroke.\nCan Ayurveda Help In Dealing With Stress and Hypertension?\nAyurveda, when taken as a lifestyle, can also help with precautions and is an ideal way to battle against diseases that originate from stress - be it physical or mental. Elements of ancient health including that of Panchkarma and DHyana can help you deal with physical and mental health respectively. A brief insight on your schedule with an organizational approach can also help you loads and as a result, you shall feel much relaxed than what you have felt in earlier times. Reducing stress can help you out in protecting yourself against these diseases as well. However, if you are already battling Hypertension, here are a few Ayurvedic remedies that can work wonders for you.\nHypertension can be easily managed with herbs like Shankhavali, Ashwagandha, and Khurasni. If you are looking forward to dealing with your mental stress, Shankhapushpi, and Brahmi are your go to herbs. However, these herbs only contribute to declining your stress levels in both aspects. In case you are having trouble managing your Hypertension or high blood pressure, it is ideal that you go for specifically curated Ayurvedic remedies Like Dr. Vaidya’s Unmadvati. Infused with herbs like Vekhand and Shatavari in addition to the above mentioned herbs, it helps in restoring your natural health while battling the consequences of hypertension."}
{"_id": "762de527", "question": "What is the correlation of blood pressure to the pulse?", "answers": "Busting 4 Myths About Blood Pressure and Heart Rate\nThese 2 vital signs measure decidedly different health factors\nBlood\npressure\nand heart rate go hand in hand in most people’s minds. After all, these two vital signs\nusually are measured at the same time at the doctor’s office.\nBut each measures distinctly different factors related to your heart health. Blood\npressure\nis the force of blood flowing against the walls of your arteries, while heart rate — sometimes called pulse — is the number of times your heart beats every minute.\n1. Blood pressure and heart rate are always linked\nFalse: It is true that blood pressure and heart rate often rise and fall together, Dr. Laffin says. When you face danger, for example, your blood pressure and pulse may both jump upward at the same time. However, if your heart rate rises, that doesn’t automatically mean your blood pressure will rise — or vice versa.\n“When the two are disconnected, you may be looking at a specific problem,” “For example, if you are dehydrated, bleeding or have a severe infection, blood pressure typically decreases and heart rate increases.”\n2. Blood pressure and heart rate have “normal” target numbers\nFalse: There are guidelines\n, but what’s normal varies from person to person.\nOptimal blood pressure typically is defined as 120 mm Hg systolic — which is the pressure as your heart beats — over 80 mm Hg diastolic — which is the pressure as your heart relaxes. For your resting heart rate, the target is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (BPM).\n3. A low pulse or blood pressure always indicates a problem\nFalse: What’s healthy for one person may indicate danger for another. For example, a fit person may have a resting heart rate in their 50s or, in some cases, even their 40s. “It can actually be a sign of being in really good shape,”\nLow\nblood\npressure\ncan be a bit trickier, especially in older patients and those with heart disease. If you’re in danger from low blood pressure, your body will tell you that you are weak.\n4. High blood pressure is more dangerous than a high heart rate\nTrue: Again, what’s considered normal varies. But doctors say there is enough clinical evidence to suggest that when blood pressure is even a little over your typical average over time, the risk for heart disease and stroke go up. The physical effects of high blood pressure take their toll on your blood vessels.\n“Essentially, for each increment of 20 mmHg over 115 mmHg systolic, your risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure or chronic kidney disease doubles,”\nElevated heart rate can be a sign of danger, too, but the cause-effect relationship is not so clear.\nCredits Google Images\n…\n..\n.\nPeace"}

{"_id": "3de932a6", "question": "What are the symptoms of high-blood pressure ?", "answers": "Most people with high blood pressure have no symptoms at all, that's why it's called the silent killer, since in the long run it can damage your heart, kidneys, brain, eyes, causing heart attacks, heart failure, strokes, even blindness.\nOnly in very severe high blood pressure (Hypertensive emergency\n) causing your brain to swell it can cause headache, nausea, confusion, paresthesia (Hypertensive encephalopathy\n), and if the eyes are severely damaged you get vision problems (Hypertensive retinopathy\n)\nSo only by measuring correctly you will know your blood pressure.\nMeasuring blood pressure is another problem, many people who on one occasion had too high a blood pressure didn't have it when blood pressure was taken at a later moment, we call it White coat hypertension\n. In the large Australian therapeutic trial in mild hypertension study published in The Lancet on 14 June 1980 they found that even after 3 measurements of too high a blood pressure 504 (12,8%) of the in total 3932 participants had a blood pressure below the inclusion range at the 4th, 5th etc. measurement so weren't that hypertensive at all. So before treating high blood pressure just make sure it really is too high.\nUsually the first measurement is falsely high, we repeat measuring blood pressure until we have two measurements within 5% of each other, the mean of which we consider the right measurement.\nYou can help your doc by measuring your own blood pressure at home using a validated blood pressure monitor, following the recommendation above, and writing the measurements down.\nHere you find a validated list (in green) of blood pressure monitors:\ndabl Educational Trust|Monitors for Self-measurement of\nBlood\nPressure\n(SBPM)\n\nI would go for an upper arm blood pressure monitor. They costs around US$ 100,- Don't just buy a cheap one, because they aren't reliable so are no good.\nBy now we have scientifically proven non pharmacological means to treat high blood pressure, being:\nloosing weight (most important)\n3-4 times a week 30-60 minutes of (aerobic and isometric) exercises\nrelaxation exercises\nless than 1 alcoholic drink a day\navoid salt in the food (unfortunately not all hypertensives are salt sensitive, so works only FOR some) strive for 2 to max 6 grams of salt a day in your food\ndon't smoke: smoking will damage your cardiovascular system more than the protection you gain from anti-hypertensive therapy.\nsome research is being done on supplementing potassium, calcium, omega 3 fatty acids, low fat diets etc.\nSee:\nNon-pharmacological treatment of hypertension.\n\nAlternative Treatments for High\nBlood\nPressure\n\nhttp://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CDkQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Fproduction%2Faction%2FcjoGetFulltext%3Ffulltextid%3D678648&ei=hTREUb-sEe2b1AW7u4C4Dw&usg=AFQjCNE6THQq53zkTGnenKwjS6p1jW-eBg&bvm=bv.43828540,d.d2k\nIf these aren' effective enough meds will be added."}

{"_id": "25b9add5", "question": "What is a normal blood pressure for someone over 70?", "answers": "When it comes to treating blood pressure, “normal for age” and “average” are not useful concepts. If high blood pressure was typical for your age group, and you could add 5 years to your life expectancy with cheap pills that lower blood pressure, would you forgo treatment just because you were average or “normal”?\nHigher levels of blood pressure are dangerous at ANY age for simple physical reasons—pressure puts a damaging physical strain on your arteries and organs. (In fact, higher pressures are probably more dangerous as you get older and your arteries and organs become less resilient.)\nCardiovascular (heart attack and stroke) risk starts to rise log-linearly above about 115 mm/Hg systolic. (Log-linearly means that the risk grows more and more quickly as systolic BP moves up from 115.)\nThere is debate about the blood pressure level at which treatment other than diet-and-exercise should be started. It depends on one’s personal situation. The most recent US guidelines define a systolic (the upper-number) BP of 119 or less as “normal,” regardless of age. By “normal,” they really mean “safe.”\n120 to 129 is termed “elevated.” 130–139 is called Stage 1 Hypertension (High Blood Pressure).\nThe old treatment threshold used to be 140 systolic, and perhaps 130 if diabetes is present. The recent SPRINT study showed that treating to below 120 reduces mortality and cardiovascular event rates by 25 and 27%, respectively, in persons with at least one other cardiovascular risk factor."}

Hi friends, let me show some high blood pressure techniques from Tracy Hughes’s WordPress blog: Top 8 tips that can help to lower your high blood pressure in just 9 mins. Tracy Hughes is a famous blogger about blood pressure.\nTracy Hughes’s Tip 1: Lose weight. Being overweight means that your heart has to pump blood to a larger body mass, which makes the heart work harder. Losing weight reduces the workload. “Plus, your heart will be better able to respond to circumstances that do require more work, like exercise,” says Dr. Zusman.\nTracy Hughes’s Tip 2: Exercise. Any activity that gets your heart pumping faster and your lungs working harder is one of the best ways to lower high blood pressure. “It improves the blood vessels’ ability to open and close, which improves blood flow,” says Dr. Zusman. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.\nTracy Hughes’s Tip 3: Reduce your stress. Chronic stress may contribute to high blood pressure. More research is needed to determine the effects of chronic stress on blood pressure. Occasional stress also can contribute to high blood pressure if you react to stress by eating unhealthy food, drinking alcohol or smoking.\nTracy Hughes’s Tip 4: Reduce sodium in your diet\nTracy Hughes’s Tip 5: Control underlying conditions.\nTracy Hughes’s Tip 6: Stop caffeine.\nTracy Hughes’s Tip 7: Limit alcohol intake.\nTracy Hughes’s Tip 8: Stop smoking.\nUseful resources:\n1- Wikipedia: Hypertension - Wikipedia\n2- HypertensionTips68: Exercise tips for high\nblood\npressure\n3- Yoga solution from Quora: What are best yoga to control blood pressure?\n4- HBPtips365: 21 ways to cure high\nblood\npressure"}

A discussion from 2016 on Medscape (behind a paywall) NSAIDs, Coxibs, and Cardio-Renal Physiology: A Mechanism-Based Evaluation: Coxibs and Hypertension Medscape Log In says. The potential mechanisms for increased BP related to therapy with NSAIDs include effects on both blood volume and peripheral resistance. As discussed, inhibition of renal PG synthesis can lead to sodium and water retention, potentially increasing plasma volume. In addition, prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator, and inhibition of its synthesis under certain conditions may increase peripheral resistance. So, in short, by blocking cyclooxygenase 2 it causes salt and water retention, intravascular volume expansion, and most likely elevating peripheral vascular resistance too."}

Not adding salt to one’s cooking at all, avoiding salted foods like bacon, sausages etc., having low salt bread and milk will lower your salt intake to around 3 - 6 grams daily.\nThis is NOT something you want to ignore (especially when it can be treated).

{"_id": "ac6ab003", "question": "Is blood pressure 105/58 good?", "answers": "There's a great deal you didn't say about individual for whom that pressure was taken. It would be an entirely satisfactory blood pressure for a healthy adult.\nBut you didn't say the age. That systolic pressure is at the brink of abnormally high (95th percentile) for an 11-year old of average height. For a shorter 11-year-old or for a younger child, it would be greater than the 95th percentile.\nYou also didn't say the circumstance. Humans maintain a satisfactory blood pressure (even when dehydrated or bleeding) until they reach a point of collapse. The term for this is \"compensated shock\". So even if the blood pressure is the same number as a healthy normal person, it would not be normal if they were pale, clammy and light-headed."}
