{"_id": "a0c9e6ee", "question": "I want to try the paleo diet, but it claims that potatoes are bad‚Äîand doesn't red meat cause strokes and other diseases?", "answers": "While many on the paleo diet do not eat potatoes, many certainly do. Often the level of starches/carbs is based on someone's goals and activity levels. Higher levels of activity = higher carb intake. Sweet potatoes and white rice are usually the go-tos but white potatoes have their place as well. Additionally there is evidence that white potatoes in the form of resistant starch\ncan be beneficial for gut bacteria.\nAs for red meat causing diseases (as many others have pointed out) this is nonsense. Don't determine your diet by what the headlines say is the latest superfood or what food is going to kill you. Its bullshit. Do your homework.\nThe paleo diet has never been about re-enactment, its a framework for living an optimal life based on human appropriate food, movement, sleep, etc. Over the past few years, the \"paleo diet\" has evolved to be more about real, whole foods than the previous strict dogma. Many folks have started including beans, potatoes, etc. based on their tolerance to these foods and overall health goals.\nFind out what works for you and don't get hung up on the minutiae."}

{"_id": "f0a86e48", "question": "Is red cell dist.width (in a blood test of CBC) can be considered as an indicator to stroke?", "answers": "In response to your excellent question, there appears to be some interesting data that tends to support this concept. By definition,, the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is an employed parameter that represents the differentiation of red blood cell volume and size. (microcytic, macrocytic and normocytic). Results of the test, along with those of other blood tests, can help doctors to confirm the presence of certain anemias, a condition characterized by a lack of red blood cells. The RDW test can additionally determine, in many cases, the underlying source of the anemia. To cite one example, in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, which is differentiated from folate deficiency, an RDW can be revealing. RDW would increase due to the release of immature RBCs in certain blood diseases. RDW tends to increase in iron deficiency anemia, as mean corpuscular volume (MCV) decreases. MCV is the average volume of a red blood cell. However, there is more to this research narrative.-\nIt has been claimed with some compelling evidence, though not thoroughly conclusive, that RDW had an interesting association to mortality prediction and cardiovascular episodes, such as acute coronary syndromes, ischemic strokes, peripheral arterial disease and hypertension. It is also believed that RDW can be a predictor of mortality in some patients with cancer, renal failure and lung disease. Cerebral infarction (CI) (ischemic stroke, 70% of all strokes)), with cerebral thrombosis, lacunar infarction, cerebral embolism are caused by a brain blood supply disorder of brain lesions. -It should be kept in mind though, that, there is really no direct biological marker to diagnose stroke. RDW might be an available alternative that can narrow the gap.-\nIn a more direct response to your curious question, current studies confirm that RDW is narrowly related to the occurrence of ischemic strokes. It has been observed that the levels of RDW in these stroke patients was higher than in those without occurring strokes. It is tempting and even logical to assume that RDW assessment plays a principle role in stroke progression, -\nAnother obvious question is how is RDW related to these mechanisms, and what exactly is causing these changes? The RDW biological mechanism between ischemic strokes and RDW is still a bit vague. There are many unanswered questions. Inflammation and oxidative stress (imbalance between the cell and its ability to rid itself of toxic metabolites), may play an important part in this dilemma. Inflammation lessens the survival ability of RBCs and causes cellular damage. Other studies say that RDW was associated with tumor necrosis factor receptors or C reactive proteins, and other inflammatory mediators, which are all inflammation markers.-\nIn conclusion, though, RDW thinly appears to be a predictor for mortality and ischemic stroke risk, though its mechanisms remain unclear. Inflammation as well appears to be a respected player in this pathological equation. Many of these research findings originate from a mixture number of independent studies (meta analyses). There is no doubt, that regarding this topic, we have glimpsed only the tip of the iceberg. WE must, and should consider the importance and relevance of all the other findings and observations before rushing to half baked conclusions. Let us continue to research, learn and properly heal, whenever we can.-"}

I am doing to use Damian Wayne as Robin because in my eyes, I only really see four Robins and three is already on this list. I don‚Äôt know who is the Batgirl but I will use Barbara Gordon, just because reasons.\nSo Deathstroke vs Damian Wayne vs Red Hood vs Red Robin vs Nightwing vs Batgirl vs Batwoman, Heretic and Ra‚Äôs al Ghul, Lady Shiva and Bronze Tiger.\nSo first thing first I will take Batgirl out, just because I believe Deathstroke, Bronze Tiger, Lady Shiva, Red Hood, Nightwing, Red Robin and Heretic can take her out. And while she is highly intelligent, when you are in a death tournament, you can‚Äôt just sit down a plan. Damian Wayne probaby can‚Äôt defeat her but he does have a chance as he is train from both. I believe Red Robin can defeat her because he started his train when he was way younger. Batwoman could ‚Äúdefeat‚Äù as she have done so in Batgirl Vol 4 12.\nNext Batwoman will go down, just because usually her advantage is that she kills but now they are in a death tournament so she no longer gets this. Deathstroke, Red Hood, Nightwing, Heretic, Ra‚Äôs al Ghul, Lady Shiva and Bronze Tiger. Damian will have difficult with her but I do believe he can win as he is trained young and have is suppose to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. I see Red Robin being smarter and will think of a way out of this.\nThen I would say Damian Wayne is down, just because he is not as skilled and some more. He can be defeated by Deathstroke, When ever Robin is fighting Red Hood, Jason is not even looking for a fight, but one of a ‚Äúout fight‚Äù, Red Hood wins. In Teen Titans Annual Vol 6 1\nAnd this is what happen when Red Robin goes ‚Äúall out‚Äù in Red Robin Vol 1 14\nAnd forget when the New 52 movies say, Nightwing can beat Damian even without trying. In Batman Vol 1 688\nIn Batman Incorporated Vol 2 8, Heretic can defeat Damian\nI can see Ra's al Ghul, Lady Shiva and Bronze Tiger beating Damian in a a death tournament.\nFor a refresh, now there is Deathstroke, Red Hood, Red Robin, Nightwing, Heretic, Ra‚Äôs al Ghul, Lady Shiva, and Bronze Tiger left standing.\nWhen all of them, Heretic can go now. I believe that Deathstroke, Ra‚Äôs al Ghul, Lady Shiva, and Bronze Tiger defeat. As Deathstroke can fight a god, Ra‚Äôs have been around for a long time, Lady Shiva is the best of the best and Bronze Tiger is also good. While Damian might fail against in Batman Incorporated Vol 2 8\nI believe Red Hood, Red Robin and Nightwing is better than Damain Wayne.\nI would say Bronze Tiger goes out next. Deathstroke can take him, even though Bronze Tiger is more skilled, Slade has his ability and can use 90% of his brain. I also don‚Äôt really count Deathstroke the Hunted Vol 1 41 but if you do, good for you.\nI can see Jason beating Ben. Just cause Red Hood is more violent, in a way, and Red Hood is also very skilled as he is train by Batman, Nightwing, Bronze Tiger, Lady Shiva and the All-Caste. I believe he is smarter than Been. In Outlaws Vol 1 26, they did fight but it is good to keep in mind that in that issue Red Hood is not at his peak.\nRed Robin while may not be more skill, he is smarter in many ways. Bronze Tiger can be probably be defeated by Nightwing with difficulty. In Grayson Vol 1 18\nWhile Bronze Tiger is good, Ra‚Äôs al Ghul have been around for a long time. and Bronze Tiger have said that Lady Shiva is better than him. In Batgirl Vol 1 67.\nNot Ben is not to be taken lightly as he is very skill with Chi Manipulation.\nI will have to say that Red Robin have to go now. While, he is great at thinking and fighting, he might not be able to live though this death tournament. Deathstroke already can defeat him in Teen Titans Vol 3 4\nRed Hood already fight Tim and win a few times before and one of those times is in Teen Titans Vol 3 29\nNightwing will be able to beat Tim Drake, and they did fight in Nightwing Vol 2 139. It should be said that they both (Tim more) are not in the best of place. But you can see that Nightwing is not looking for a fight and is winning.\nWhile, Red Robin can out smart Ra‚Äôs, he did it with planing but with the same reason as Barbara, he can‚Äôt just think. And Ra‚Äôs should be skilled enough to defeat Tim. In Red Robin Issue 12\nWhile Red Robin did win aganist Lady Shiva\nBut if you think about Lady Shiva is not stupid and she won‚Äôt be falling for tricks, that is if Tim have time to plan against her with so many people.\nLady Shiva is good but I believe it is time for her to go. While she is good, Deathstroke has enhanced everything. And don‚Äôt believe the movie, Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons\nIn Outlaws Vol 1 26, Jason was was able to fight against Lady Shiva\nAnd while in Nightwing Vol 3 14, Lady Shiva did win, Nightwing was already injure before the fight, on top of that Nightwing did not even really use any of his weapons, besides the Escrima Sticks and two of his wingdings.\nBut Nightwing can land attack her still even if Lady Shiva can read his body language. Nightwing is suppose to be a unpredictable fighter and that‚Äôs what help him survive against Midnighter in Grayson Vol 1 6\nRa‚Äôs al Ghul have been around this earth the longest of everyone here. He have the most experience, he also have the Lazarus Enhancement, which help a lot in places like his strength, speed, stamina, agility, and durability. He can take on Batman, something Lady Shiva can‚Äôt really do.\nThe next person I will dismiss will be Ra‚Äôs al Ghul. Deasthstroke is better but not by a lot, while Ra‚Äôs al Ghul is the better fighter. In Deathstroke Vol 3 20, Deathstroke did seems like losing but I don‚Äôt believe he was in the right mind\nSo Ra‚Äôs al Ghul have a pretty big chance of winning but I am pretty sure that Deathstroke is stronger, faster, and smarter.\nRed Hood have defeat Ra‚Äôs al Ghul before in Outlaws Vol 1 27\nNightwing have defeated him in Nightwing Vol 2 152\nSo now down to three; Deathstroke vs Red Hood vs Nightwing.\nNightwing will now met his death because when you can comparing Deathstroke, Red Hood and Nightwing and ask who is the worst at killing, the answer will be Nightwing. While usauuly in a Nightwing vs Red Hood fight, I would back up Nightwing but this is a death tournament we are talking about. But in a in character fight, I would say Nightwing as he usually wins. In Batman: Battle for the Cowl Vol 1 3\nAnd when Nightwing goes against Deathstroke, it doesn‚Äôt usually go that well for Dick. In New Titans Vol 1 86\nGoing down to Red Hood and Deathstroke, the winner will be Deathstroke. While Jason is able to ‚Äúdefeat‚Äù Slade in Deathstroke Vol 3 16, he was already injure before the fight and in the fight Deathstroke did put up a really great fight.\nThis is just my long and sort of bias opinion."}

The major cause of morbidity and mortality is arterial thrombosis. Over time, polycythemia vera may convert to myelofibrosis or to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In approximately 5% of cases, the disorder progresses to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which is usually refractory to therapy. It should, therefore, be apparent that anyone with a diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) should be referred to a hematologist.\nCitations:\nBarbui, T et al, The 2016 revision of WHO classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms: clinical and molecular advances.

A lesion there can cause cerebellar traits (without the truncal tribulations of a cerebellar stroke caused by Corticopontine projection fibers[7] being affected), and usually called Ataxic hemiparesis[8][9] (footnote #9 I added because so much data online concludes PLIC/ICpost strokes are caused by Middle Cerebral or Carotid arteries [including prestigious institutions as Stanford medical school], but the PLIC is a border zone between anterior and posterior circulations, and 4 arterial branches converge there ‚Äî carotid artery (23.1%), middle cerebral artery (38.5%), PCA (17.3%), and the posterior communicating artery (21.1%)).\nFootnotes\n[1] Hemiparesis - Wikipedia\n[2] Stroke\n[3] Home\n[4] Functional role of the corticoreticular pathway in chronic stroke patients.\n[5] ScienceDirect\n[6] Corticofugal Motor Systems\n[7] ScienceDirect\n[8] Ataxic Hemiparesis\n[9] The Posterior Limb of the Internal Capsule as the Subcortical Transitional Zone of the Anterior and Posterior Circulations: Insights from Human 7T MRI"}

I was a scientist at the National Geophysical Data Center; my life had basically been defined by science since high school. No longer ‚Ä¶\nI was stuck at home alone. My husband travelled a lot for his job; he said he needed to be away anyway. Apparently I was a handful!\nFortunately, I had my church, where I developed strong friendships. Even then, though, I usually only saw people on Sunday morning =(\nTo complicate matters, I quickly discovered that things have the potential to get extremely weird if you announce to people that you‚Äôve had strokes. Nobody younger than about 60 even knows what a stroke IS. Of the people who do get it, the symptoms of stroke vary so widely that there‚Äôs no one set of deficits they can accurately predict you to have. ‚ÄúI apologize, but I‚Äôve got to go home now. I‚Äôm very tired,‚Äù might be acceptable once, but you can‚Äôt use it a lot before arousing suspicion that you‚Äôre just a party pooper.\nI can no longer drive. Do you know how difficult it is to get together with friends when you can‚Äôt get to them?\nEventually, my friends became the characters on TV shows I watched. I worked alongside Dr. Carter from ER and in the Office with Jim and Pam. It was a sad existence =(\nThe second effect the strokes had on me was to decrease my self esteem. In fact, this is the one thing that my therapists warned me about; sadly, their caution wasn‚Äôt misplaced. In addition to the loneliness I felt, I could also seemingly do nothing right.\n‚ÄúGoodness gracious, Kathy, you didn‚Äôt get the dog collars on right!?!? So you were shocking Chaco instead of Bonzo?‚Äù my husband accused me after Bonzo had bitten a neighbor. To top it off, I‚Äôd come inside to report Bonzo‚Äôs bad behavior and begun laughing hysterically, unaware that I suffered from psychobulbar affect (when you get your emotions mixed up and laugh and cry at odd times).\nSpeaking of PBA, it basically causes me to cry every time I hear loud music. Like at that college basketball game DH took me to and insisted that I not sit down until I stop sobbing. And like every Halloween parade my daughter has ever attended. It‚Äôs humiliating.\nWhen I was finally up to start cooking again it was rather hit-or-miss. I remember baking a usually delicious triple chocolate fudge cake and forgetting the sugar, leading to a less than appealing concoction, and serving it to DH‚Äôs work friends. Oops.\nThere are times when I dive back into my level two to three tiredness and can‚Äôt do ANYTHING. That sucks, but what sucks more is the inability to define it as a stroke thing. Maybe I‚Äôm just lazy! =(\nIn short, having a stoke is like losing your old self.

{"_id": "cc609d23", "question": "Why would I want the Covid vaccine if it has a clotting disorder as a side effect, and I‚Äôve had multiple strokes? Aren‚Äôt strokes caused by clotting disorders?", "answers": "Okay, here goes:\nCOVID-19 causes more than 20 times the number of blood clots of all types than any vaccines. So you reduce the chance of blood clots by taking the vaccine.\nThe numbers of blood clots seen for all except the Oxford vaccine is similar to the number of blood clots you see in the same number of unvaccinated people. So there is no risk ameliorated by not taking the vaccine.\nThe number of blood clots for the Oxford vaccine is problematic because a firm cause is suspected. But the numbers are still so small that they are under the aegis of the Law Of Small Numbers that basically says that when the number of observations is too small, no useful conclusions can be drawn.\nThe reasons that the Oxford and J&J vaccines were ‚Äúpaused‚Äù was not because of the blood clots per se, but because under Emergency Use Authorizations, the criteria are much, much, much more strict and the monitoring is much more intensive. It was just an overabundance of caution that was as much political as scientific. This is the system working like it is supposed to.\nBirth control pills cause over 500 times as many blood clots per user. n.b. Childbirth is still 100 times as dangerous as taking birth control pills. This doesn‚Äôt stop the use of birth control pills, does it?\nThe number one cause of strokes is high blood pressure, not clots. This is followed by diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, tobacco, heart disease, poor diet, alcohol, lack of exercise, and stress, in that order. Notice that blood clots and vaccines ae not even in the top ten. However, COVID-19 can easily result in strokes and blood clots that will absolutely kill you quite dead.\nGet the vaccine, especially if you are in poor health and have had strokes."}
{"_id": "2aa2dd82", "question": "What effects do strokes have on people short term and long term?", "answers": "Strokes affect different people in different ways. The fact that your friend‚Äôs mom seems to be doing well now is a good sign, because people tend to get better as they recover from strokes. However, she may be at risk of future strokes. I have seen strokes have the following affects on people:\nNo effect\nSemi-paralysis\nFull paralysis\nSpeech impairment\nBrain damage\nFine motor skills impairment\nSometimes strokes will affect one side of a body. A person can experience full or partial paralysis of his or her entire right side. You may notice one side of the face droops; that is because half of the face is paralyzed. If someone has facial paralysis, they may need eye drops to help moisten the eye that doesn't blink naturally.\nSometimes a stroke can cause severe brain damage. The person may lose all ability to speak. It may affect other areas of cognitive functioning, too. Some people go through intensive rehabilitation to relearn how to walk, write, read, and talk.\nI have had clients who did not even know they had high blood pressure. They only learned about it when they suffered a major stroke. One woman in particular is paralyzed on one side, wheel chair bound, and lost the ability to read. Now She is able to communicate and sign her name, and she can walk with a leg brace and someone near by in case she falls. It has been about 9 years since her stroke. Some people recover more quickly than that.\nI really hope your friend‚Äôs mom will be ok Everything I stated above is a frightening prospect, but like I said earlier, if she is doing good now, her abilities are not likely to regress."}
{"_id": "175680b3", "question": "Is clopidogrel or ticlopidine (ticlid) as effective as aspirin in preventing stroke?", "answers": "Clopidogrel is an anti-clotting drug: it prevents platelets from congregating at the site of a broken blood vessel and plugging up the tear.\nI believe that clopidogrel is better than aspirin at preventing ISCHEMIC stroke because my neurologist told me that she wasn‚Äôt surprised that I‚Äôd had another on just aspirin. She also told me that she thought clopidogrel would, in my case, prevent further strokes better than warfarin! I was very glad to hear that; warfarin is an extremely strong drug, requires that you eat a constant amount of leafy green vegetables, and requires that you get frequent testing to make sure your levels are ok.\nBut please be sure that we‚Äôre talking about the same kind of stroke. All of these drugs are anti-clotting/anti-coagulant-types, and will help to prevent an ischemic stroke BUT are not useful in preventing hemmoragic stroke; they actually increase your risk of such a stroke. That said, I know of somebody who had an hemmoragic stroke and was put on warfarin afterwards to prevent another stroke. In short, it‚Äôs really complicated! I‚Äôd trust your doctor.\nTL;DR Probably."}
{"_id": "ecbcbe1c", "question": "What is a stroke, and what are the effects of stroke? What effects can be seen with a stroke in the brain stem?", "answers": "As the blood pressure drops down, the blood supply towards the brain decreases and it does not get enough oxygen and nutrients. This creates a state of hypoxia. Very less blood flow toward the brain can lead to ischemic shock which releases inflammatory mediators that cause Hypotension Headache. The pain usually increases upon bending forward or lying down.\nLow Blood pressure can be due to excessive electrolyte loss by vomiting and diarrhea especially in summers when the body is already on the verge of dehydration.\nExcessive bleeding can also lead to hypovolemia and thus hypotension and ischemic stroke to the brain.\nSome inflammatory conditions such as pancreatitis can also cause Hypotension as fluid enters the inflamed tissue around the pancreas and in the abdominal cavity, escaping from the blood vessels resulting in concentrated blood and Hypovolemia.\nBradycardia that is slow heart rate can also decrease the amount of blood pumped by the heart resulting in low blood pressure, lightheadedness, and sometimes even syncope (fainting).\nSome medications can also cause Hypotension, such as: Calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, Antidiuretics, ACE inhibitors, and Alpha Blockers"}
{"_id": "27eef567", "question": "How can we increase the power of an engine without changing the bore and stroke of the engine cylinder?", "answers": "Increasing the power of an engine can help increase the performance of your car to a certain extent.\nYou increase the power output by any of the following methods:\nI) Installing a bigger air filter: a bigger and more efficient air filter will help your engine breath better.\nThis will improve combustion and thus increase the power output. This is one of the cheapest options available in the market. This also implies that the end power output won't be very noticeable. It doesn't require many changes to other parts of the car and doesn't increase the load or pressure on the engine.\nII) ECU remapping: the brain of the engine can be remapped in order to increase the power output. It alters the way the engine responds and thus increase the power it produces.\nThis method too doesn't cost much and doesn't require many changes to other parts of the car. Again the net power output is limited.\nIII) Installing a turbocharger: a turbocharger is much like an air filter only it pumps sufficiently more amount of air in to engine and thus increases power output.\nIf you are looking for a power bump in\na diesel car it's more likely that you already have a turbocharger installed. It isnt cheap and many a times it is necessary to upgrade accompanying parts of the engine. This is because more power means more pressure or load on the engine which needs to taken care of by cooling the engine efficiently and adjusting it's computers and mechanicals. A good turbo can boost your engines power output by 50bhp!\nTo contain the increase in power necessary improvement in mechanicals are recommended. Better brake pads are recommended. So are gaskets and filters. Oils and coolants of higher effectiveness (i.e aimed at high performance vehicles) are recommended. ECU remapping can further boost performance. Recalibration or gauges and meters may also be required.\nIncreasing the power of an old vehicle can lend a new lease of life to the vehicle and if done carefully can make a new car even more spirited. All the best for your mod. :)"}
{"_id": "b290eba9", "question": "What is Ram effect in Petrol engine during compression stroke?", "answers": "Generally inlet valve is closed at few degrees after piston reaches bdc ie. During initial part of compression, inlet valve remains open for few degrees. It ensures that momentum of incoming air is not hampered. This momentum provides inertia to incoming air to move forward even though compression has started. This phenomenon of pushing air into the cylinder with the help of its momentum is called ram effect.\nThus ram effect pushes more air into the cylinder to increase volumetric efficiency."}
{"_id": "33fa60d7", "question": "What are the long and short term effects of a stroke? What varying symptoms occur before and after a stroke survivor?", "answers": "I‚Äôm a stroke survivor. I know exactly how lucky I have been, but I still hate it.\nI had a right-side ischemic (clot) stroke with damage to the right posterior basal ganglia. The damage is small- only 1.2 cm across. The effects, though, are big.\nI did not lose consciousness nor have my cognitive abilities been damaged according to the Speech Language Pathologist. I could bear weight and had a reciprocal gait the next day. However‚Äî\nI had no idea where my left hand was- none. Once it was bent up behind me, and the nurse had to reposition because I was nearly laying on it, and didn‚Äôt know it wasn‚Äôt resting comfortably in front of me. If I held a cup of water in that hand and wasn‚Äôt looking at it every second, I would spill it- not from lack of strength, but because I didn‚Äôt know where it was and what position it was in, so the cup would tilt and spill. This is called proprioception- and I lost left side proprioception in a really weird way.\nThe loss in the upper limb- the hand- is pretty classic; the loss in the lower limb, hip to toes, was weird. Unlike not knowing where my foot was without looking, I lost bits and pieces of proprioception. For instance, I had my toes, but not my ankle. I could feel weight on my knee, but not my calf. My hip was all buggered up by it, with some muscles of the joint being known and others just along for the ride. In Therapy, they worked on strength so I could at least walk without a walker, but it took time to get all my bits and pieces back so I could do it correctly. I have stumped around like Igor for the past four months, but this past week, I seem to be getting back the last piece in my hip which is effecting the psoas muscle. Hooray for me!\nBut, I still hate it.\nI am no longer graceful- I was so graceful and competent. I moved swiftly and unerringly; I could walk two miles in 15 minutes; I could reach and bend and crouch and stretch and climb and move.\nNow I have to think about every move I make. I have to think when I walk- consciously think about each bit of the stride, chiding myself when my heel doesn‚Äôt strike the floor in the correct cadence, when I don‚Äôt push off with my toes hard enough, screwing up the gait. It is so tiring. It is so disheartening to have to do this, to have to be so super-aware of what used to be done naturally, with no thought, at all.\nI await the day I suddenly realize I haven‚Äôt had to think about all of this- I hope it comes soon.\nBut, I am lucky- very, very lucky. I could have lost the ability to swallow correctly, thus being on a feeding tube (worst case) or pureed mush diet for, well, ever. I could have lost the ability to speak, the larnyx frozen. I could have lost cognitive ability- as is, for the first couple months, it was as if the toy box where I held my stuff had been given a big shake; I knew I had whatever bit I needed, but had to sort through to find it again. But I could have lost all of it, I could have lost my life, so I am lucky.\nAnd all my therapists seem so surprised to learn I am only 4 months out from this stroke; ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre already back at work?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to push so hard, you know‚Äù; yes, I do, because I know the earlier I get back, the more I get back, so it‚Äôs off to the races as far as I am concerned.\nThere was no precursor to my stroke. In fact, the whole episode took about 10 minutes- How do you stop a stroke while it‚Äôs happening? I‚Äôve read some people feel dizzy sometimes, but there‚Äôs usually no sign it‚Äôs coming.\nWhich is why they can be so deadly.\nIf you are at risk for stroke, follow your doctor‚Äôs instructions- if you can get away from having this happen to you, you‚Äôll be glad."}

{"_id": "fe18f8aa", "question": "What is best style in swimming?", "answers": "Most strokes have some advantage to them. They are each best in one circumstance or another.\nFor swimming fast or long, front crawl, sometimes known as freestyle is best. There is nothing more efficient. It is the high speed, fuel efficient motorcycle of strokes.\nBreaststroke is the Mac truck of strokes. Not that fast but hugely powerful.\nStory time: At university, our coach devised a competition where two swimmers would be connected to surgical tubing. This tubing was strong and very elastic. Even with its elasticity, two swimmers going opposite directions could not both make it to their end of the pool. The coach gave no rules so I kept my breaststroke option secret. I outswam my first opponent simply with freestyle and then faced two more opponents and was furious. I migh have been able to beat the first one using freestyle but it was a close thing. I was faster but he was stronger. So I stuck to freestyle for around a minute then switched and pulled him down the pool. He later said he knew exactly when I switched strokes and he felt as if Ihad pulled on the side. The final swimmer was much better than I but not at breaststroke so I beat him to but it was more work than I wanted.\nOkay, breaststroke is good for towing things or getting your head high in waves.\nBackstroke gives you a different view and I have used it to navigate. I swam away from one or two objects on shore and could watch them best while doing backstroke.\nI have heard that Navy Seals use a form of side stroke for very long swims. I have gone 12 km using frontcrawl but that was in smooth water so maybe sidestroke is better in surf or waves.\nI can‚Äôt think of a practical reason to do butterfly. It looks really cool and gives you big shoulders (if the training doesn‚Äôt cause shoulder injury!) so it may be good for showing off. To be honest, since I don‚Äôt compete anymore, that is the only reason I do butterfly now.\nWhat do you want to do? The answer will determine what the best stroke is."}

She's a few years younger than I but she told me it's normal, to an extent, to have thoughts such as this as we age. She said she tells herself she's here, now, this day, and that's all that's guaranteed anyone. Even a young person could have an accident or suddenly become gravely ill. She said she simply pushes thoughts of such from her mind, works and finds distractions and doesn't dwell on it. I've been trying to do the same with a fair degree of success.\nThis is probably just a temporary rumination, you will probably pass through this phase. Of course everyone on the planet is mortal but why ruin today thinking about the future? It's helpful if you could share your thoughts with close friends or family.

{"_id": "71d595a6", "question": "How do Strokes occur and how do they effect the human brain and body?", "answers": "The term ‚Äústroke‚Äù when referring to the brain describes two very different scenarios: the most common (maybe 90%) of strokes are caused by an embolism, a blood clot in an artery feeding the brain which slows or entirely stops blood flow in that artery, killing the brain structure dependent on that blood flow. The other kind of ‚Äústroke‚Äù, much less common (about 10%) is called an aneurysm (which can occur anywhere in the body) or a brain bleed. There are two kinds of aneurysms: the blood vessel has a weakness in the wall that causes it to balloon outward until it breaks, flooding the brain with blood, and a collapse inward that causes a tear in the blood vessel, same result, blood flooding the interstitial spaces of the brain and insufficient blood flow to the brain structure through normal delivery channels, so that brain structure suffers cell death.\nBecause an embolism induced brain stroke and a brain aneurysm stroke can have the same symptoms (at first), it is a risk to inject the chemical that dissolves blood clots because it can make a brain bleed even worse.\nA stroke can be so mild you don‚Äôt even notice it, until they keep occurring and finally symptoms appear. Depending on where it occurs, there are a great variety of symptoms, you can look them up."}

{"_id": "93808fec", "question": "What are the most effective treatments available for stroke patients?", "answers": "For ischemic strokes (80% of all strokes) within the thrombrctomy window (up to 4.5 hrs after last seen normal), and without any contraindications, the gold standard treatment is IV thrombolysis. For patients meeting certain criteria (i.e. large proximal vessel occlusion, small infarct core, etc‚Ä¶), endovascular thrombectomy can also be considered. If the patient presents outside the window or is ineligible for thrombolysis, he or she is admitted for strict blood pressure and intracranial pressure control.\nFor hemorrhagic strokes (20% of all strokes), the immediate goal is blood pressure and intracranial pressure control, with a combination of medications, hypertonic saline, and/or external ventricular drain placement. After further work up with CT, MRI, and/or angiography a definitive treatment plan is made often with surgical intervention (i.e. clip or coil an aneurysm, resection of AVM, etc‚Ä¶). If no vascular malformation is identified, for example, in cases of trauma or hypertensive intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the patient is medically managed for strict blood pressure and intracranial pressure control.\nThis is of course a general overview and specific management is individualized for each patient.

{"_id": "4a7170db", "question": "Which has the greater effect on cardiac output, stroke volume or heart rate?", "answers": "Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. An increase in both can increase the cardiac output.\nDuring exercise it is seen that in the initial stages there is increased venous return from the muscles, this brings about in increase in stroke volume which can increase by about 2 - 3 times from the normal. Subsequently the increase in cardiac output can be brought about by the increase in heart rate alone.\nWhich of these predominate to increase cardiac output will depend on what stage of exercise the individual is at. Both stroke volume and heart rate will increase when a person starts to exercise. At approximately 40% of the maximum possible exercise intensity possible the increase in stroke volume stops or slows down and then on the increase in heart rate keeps the increase in cardiac output."}

{"_id": "9d65ee06", "question": "What will be the long-term effects of a person who survived a hemorrhagic stroke?", "answers": "Like with all strokes it depends on the location of the stroke and anatomical differences (where the arteries [or veins] are located, as there‚Äôs anatomical differences that 5mm away can be a difference between a minor or a catastrophic stroke).\nThis is what stroke survivors mean about location and/or anatomical differences.\nI‚Äôll use the Posterior Limb of the Internal Capsule (ICpos) for an example, as that‚Äôs what I study.\nSee the blue area? It can actually be influenced by *3* arteries: lenticulostriate branches of the MCA; anterior choroidal artery; AND the deep branches of the Posterior Cerebral Artery.\nMy stroke was a PCA stroke. It hit in between the Genu and the Corticospinal tract areas, nearer to the Thalamus. So that anatomy difference is how one stroke hit 5 areas of the brain ‚Ä¶. but luckily it was mild due to the location (skipping especially a direct hit on the Corticospinal tract (A/T/L area), which would‚Äôve paralyzed my arm, hand and leg).\nThe Corticospinal tract is a major motor pathway in the brain, and it tunnels through the ICpos white matter, where one small lesion can take out the arm and leg movement in one strike permanently.\nNow you can understand WHY location is critical in the outcomes.\n^^ That shows how an ICpos stroke can affect not only the Corticospinal tract and vision, it can affect hearing, too. Why I have, ironically, LEFT sided hearing problems though I had a Right Hemisphere (RH) stroke. Actual location of the lesion is in the RH ICpos, but everything from the left eyelid to left toe was effected. Including the throat, especially with swallowing and talking (hoarseness), too.\nThe drawing below explains HOW a RH stroke shows the opposite side (contralateral) affects , even if it doesn‚Äôt cross at the Medulla. Evolution caused the body to protect the RH, since cognition and executive functions (decision making) are located there. RH strokes are more rare.\nAs for a hemorrhagic stroke outcomes compared to a ischemic stroke? Hemorrhagic strokes are more devastating. Person will have a bad migraine headache and will attempt to lay down for relief. IF they survive to wake up again; or luck up when someone notices something isn‚Äôt right, by the time they get to the hospital it‚Äôs too late (bleed to death if it‚Äôs a large enough aneurysm; or 12hrs later with a slow leak the inflammation wrecks havoc on the brain tissue itself). Actual blood contact to the brain is highly toxic and causes a nasty inflammation that leads to worse outcomes.\nBUT, it depends on location of the hemorrhage; the size; and did the person get to the hospital fast enough to get help. PLUS, the will of the person to struggle through the obstacles in physical therapy. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, got to press forward despite the odds. If the docs say chances are you won‚Äôt walk again, fight on. That‚Äô‚Äôs what my grandpa did after a devastating MCA stroke that paralyzed his arm and leg, and the docs said he will be wheelchair bound. But he showed them he could walk with a cane and braces again.\nEach stroke survivor‚Äôs journey to recovery is personal."}

There is a limit to how far the bore can be increased before encountering issues with cylinder wall integrity, ring seal, and overheating. Generally, a longer stroke will provide more torque than before, and make the torque peak occur earlier in the engine's rev range than an engine of similar displacement with a larger bore and shorter stroke. In a high performance application, the increased displacement from stroking should be matched by a bigger carb or injectors, more cam, and porting the heads to meet the demand for air and fuel."}

{"_id": "ab48f6ef", "question": "What are the alternatives to anti-epileptic drugs like Levipil (Generic name: Levetiracetam) given to patients post a hemorrhagic stroke? Potentially with better results and fewer side effects.", "answers": "As per the NICE guidelines, it is recommended that the lowest, most effective dose of an anti-epileptic proven to have the highest efficacy for the patient‚Äôs seizure-type and epilepsy should be chosen; if mono therapy with one agent is deemed ineffective, or produces intolerable side-effects, then mono therapy with a second agent may be tried, after overlapping and tapering the dose of the first one as per established guidelines; this can be continued with the second or third anti-epileptic, till all choices have been exhausted, at which point polypharmacy or combination drugs may be considered.\nThis is to highlight how far away Neurologist‚Äôs and epileptilogists want to move away from the erstwhile practise of using suboptimal doses of several drugs - something I still find happening occasionally.\nThe picture below is a screenshot from NICE\npage of the said guidelines:\nIn practise, I have found Levetiracetam to be relatively free of side - effects - except for agitation and restless in elderly/demented patients, and some patients have complained of worsened tremors. The concern is of efficacy - and the general feeling is that if a drug is not producing much side-effect, then it‚Äôs not producing that much effect either! Which might be the reason why Granny‚Äôs nostrums almost always made you feel you were going to choke and die!\nI haven‚Äôt had an issue with lack of efficacy as far as levetiracetam is concerned, but I am a consensus of one man! Let the others submit their reports!\nBut if you did want to replace it, and myoclonus jerks or absence seizures (petit mal) are not included in the patient‚Äôs repertoire, then oxcarbazepine would be my choice. A lot of people prefer lamotrigine, but the high incidence of skin lesions (unless dose escalation is done very carefully) makes it somewhat difficult. It has shown good improvement in scholastic performance, which is an added advantage in school-going children with borderline IQs. It is also a broad-spectrum antiepileptic, so it can be given in someone who has more than one seizure type (grand mal + myoclonus, etc). It may also be a better choice in women, as the alternative (Depakine/Valproate) is a drug you would wish to avoid in them.\nMy experience with other alternatives is not enough to give any advise."}

My affected left leg would swing in a semi circle around my body to complete a step, with my hip hiking up mid step to propel me forward.

Shoulders back eyes straight ahead while strolling on my treadmill for 15 to 30 minutes a day. I find it is really helping to smooth my walking gait. I am hopeful to walk without the use of an aid this year such as a cane or in my case a hiking pole for balance. My advice to anyone in this situation.

{"_id": "2403530c", "question": "Are there case studies that prove that diet soda's cause or contribute to developing dementia or suffering the effects of a stroke?", "answers": "From studies\nArtificially Sweetened Drinks Linked to\nStroke\nAfter adjusting for known stroke\nrisk factors\n, such as obesity, age, and high blood pressure, the researchers found that women who drank 24 ounces or more of diet beverages per day were 23 percent more likely to have a stroke than those who drank less than 12 ounces per week. They were also 29 percent more likely to develop heart disease\nand 16 percent more likely to die from any cause.\nOther studies have shown a connection between diet drinks and\nstroke\n. For example, in April 2017, researchers at Boston University School of Medicine found that people age 45 and older who drank one or more diet sodas every day were three times more likely to have a stroke than those who didn‚Äôt drink them.\nBut this new study is one of the first to zero in on the link between diet beverages and specific subtypes of strokes. The researchers found that big consumers of diet drinks had an 81 percent greater risk of small artery occlusion, a stroke that‚Äôs caused by a blockage of small vessels in the brain, than women who consumed less than one per day. ‚ÄúThese strokes are not generally as devastating as those caused by a large vessel blockage,‚Äù says Mossavar-Rahmani. ‚ÄúBut if you have them repeatedly, they can lead to dementia.\nGreater Risk for Some Women\nThe study found that heavy consumption of diet drinks put certain women at far greater risk. Those who were obese\n(defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher) were about twice as likely to have an ischemic stroke as obese women who rarely or never drank them.\nFor African-American women, those who drank the most diet beverages were about four times more likely to have an ischemic stroke. ‚ÄúWe know that in general stroke rates are higher in African-Americans and in those who are obese,‚Äù says Mossavar-Rahmani. ‚ÄúBut our data can‚Äôt explain why higher diet drink consumption increased risk so significantly for these groups and not for others.‚Äù\nAnd big consumers of diet drinks who did not have a history of heart disease or diabetes were 2¬Ω times more likely to have small artery occlusion compared with such women who rarely or ever drink them.\nWhat the Study Can't Tell Us\nThe study authors caution that their findings don't actually say that diet drinks cause stroke.\n‚ÄúObservational studies like this one attempt to associate behaviors with outcomes but cannot prove cause and effect,‚Äù says Robert Rankin, president of the Calorie Control Council, a group that represents the low-calorie and reduced-calorie food and beverage industry. ‚ÄúIt is likely study subjects were already at greater health risk and chose these beverages to manage their calorie and sugar intake.‚Äù\nAnd though this very large group was tracked for almost 12 years, the information on diet-drink consumption came from a questionnaire given three years into the study asking how often the women drank artificially sweetened drinks in the previous three months. ‚ÄúThe results are derived from a snapshot in time,‚Äù says Hannah Gardener, Sc.D., associate scientist in the department of neurology at the University of Miami, who co-authored an editorial accompanying the study. ‚ÄúFor some people, that may not reflect their long-term consumption pattern.‚Äù\nIt's also not known whether the women who drank large quantities of diet beverages had spent their previous years drinking sugar-sweetened sodas\n. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible that they were already on the road to heart disease when they switched to the artificially sweetened beverages,‚Äù says Ralph L. Sacco, M.D., professor of neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. And because this study looked only at postmenopausal women, the results don‚Äôt necessarily apply to younger women or men.\nWhat You Should Do\nDespite many studies showing associations between diet soda intake and adverse health effects, researchers caution that they still don‚Äôt know exactly why diet sodas might be bad for you. It‚Äôs possible that ingredients in the beverages‚Äîincluding the artificial sweeteners‚Äîcould damage blood vessels, affect metabolic function, or cause inflammation.\nThe best advice, given what we know so far, is to err on the side of caution. ‚ÄúThis study adds to the growing consistency of research showing an association between diet soda consumption and heart disease risk,‚Äù says Sacco. ‚ÄúAnd since research has not shown that switching to artificially sweetened beverages is that helpful for weight loss\n, there‚Äôs very little reason to recommend drinking them.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe have enough data now to recommend people be cautious about diet soda consumption,‚Äù says Gardener. ‚ÄúThe research shows that they are not harmless and that they may actually increase your risk of cardiovascular events\n, such as stroke.‚Äù She advises that water is the best beverage, and says if people use diet drinks to help wean themselves off sugar-sweetened ones, they should do so for a limited period of time as they transition to water\nand other healthier beverages.\nCorrection: A previously published version of this story said that the researchers found that big consumers of diet drinks had an 18 percent greater risk of small artery occlusion stroke. The correct increase in risk is 81 percent. In addition, the Boston University Study was conducted April 2017, not April 2018.\nA recent study found that drinking even one diet soda a day may triple your risk for developing dementia. But there's a lot more to the story. Nutrition Diva explains\nBy Nutrition Diva Monica Reinagel\non August 23, 2017\nHome\nIn a large observational study, women who reported drinking more than one diet soda or other artificially sweetened drinks a day had a higher risk of strokes caused by a blood clot. The association between diet drinks and stroke risk was stronger in obese women and in African-American women. Feb 14, 2019\nWhat does soda do to your brain?\nResearchers using data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) found that people who drink sugary beverages frequently are more likely to have poorer memory, smaller overall brain volume, and a significantly smaller hippocampus‚Äîan area of the brain important for learning and memory.

{"_id": "88577d38", "question": "As a medical doctor, in which cases do you discontinue statin drug for a patient who has had a history of stroke? Which side effects are bad enough to convince you to discontinue?", "answers": "There are a few main reasons:\n1- As Amy points out, rhabdomyolysis is a hard contraindication to statins and usually requires an alternative therapy to be considered.\nThere are, however, a few other reasons why you might stop it, stroke history or not:\n2- If the patient has a terminal illness and a limited prognosis, then it‚Äôs not uncommon to cease any and all medications except those with symptomatic benefit. For instance, someone who is dying of advanced cancer and has days to weeks will probably not benefit from long-term cholesterol-lowering therapy!\n3- Similarly, patients who are very old may well no longer benefit from a statin long-term, even if they do have a history of stroke."}
{"_id": "90d8aed1", "question": "What is a ‚Äúlacunar stroke‚Äù? What effects can one have?", "answers": "A lacunar stroke occurs when one of the arteries that provide blood to the brain's deep structures is blocked.Unlike most arteries, which gradually taper to a smaller size, the small arteries of a lacunar stroke branch directly off of a large, high-pressure, heavily muscled main artery. Many of the deep brain organs that can be injured by a lacunar stroke help to relay communication between the brainstem and the brain cortex, or help to coordinate complicated body movements. In a lacunar stroke, brain cells in a relatively small area (measuring from 3 millimeters to as much as 2 centimeters across) are damaged or killed by lack of oxygen. Such a small area of brain destruction is called a lacune. A lacunar stroke involves only a small area of the brain, but it can cause significant disability.\nPeople often begin to recover within hours or days of a lacunar stroke. Lacunar strokes have a better rate of recovery than other strokes that involve larger blood vessels. More than 90 percent of people with a lacunar stroke will recover substantially within the first three months following the stroke."}

If you ask me a question sometimes I don't see all that's involved withit. Ie: my sister wanted to have a family reunion at my house. I said ‚Äúsure\". A few days of thinking about it and I realized I can't deal with all those people being in my house or clean up after them, etc. So I felt horrible for then having to turn around and tell her no. But I did explain that from now on she should give me a few days or so before she expects an answer so I have plenty of time to think about things. That's just one example.\nI am more emotional then I was before. I used to hardly ever cry. Now I cry if the scale tips even just a little bit in any given direction. I cry if I'm sad, mad, glad, happy, and it scares me. I'm not used to it. Neither are family and friends. I never know what's going to trigger my crying or when. It can be embarrassing at times. They always think I'm upset or they hurt my feelings.\nI can't multi-task like I used to. My attention span doesn't allow for it. It's like my brain shuts down if there is too much going on.\nI sleep alot! Naps are my bestfriend. I tire really easy. I'm 4 years post-stroke and it still hasn't gotten much better.\nIt's hard sometimes to embrace the new me. I know things could be a lot worse, and I'm thankful that it isn't. It's okay to say no, it's okay to cry and it's okay to do what you need for yourself. Those are hard lessons to learn."}

{"_id": "c5d1b4f5", "question": "Do you think that a person with a family history of heart attack and stroke will reduce their risk by donating platelets through apheresis? There has been no personal cardiac event. Would taking Plavix be worth the potential side effects.", "answers": "Probably No and No - but read on. There a number of well recognised risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart attack and ischaemic stroke), but a risk factor is a little different from a treatment target. The recommended preventative treatments are those based on prospective clinical studies showing that the treatment (lifestyle or medical) achieves the desired outcome - as measured by a reduced risk of a clinical measurement (reduction in death/stroke/heart attack), not by a change in a de facto risk marker (e.g. BP, blood sugar or cholesterol level). So the things that reduce risk are healthy diet (yes, moderate alcohol intake is OK), regular exercise, avoiding smoking, treating high BP ‚Ä¶ and if you are at high risk, statin medication and aspirin. Of relevance statins have been thought of as cholesterol lowering drugs and therefore that any benefit is related to this effect. naturally many people assume that and cholesterol lowering will be beneficial, and therefore the modest effect of platelet apheresis ‚Äòmight‚Äô have a small benefit. It turns out however that statins have lots of effect unrelated to the change in blood cholesterol levels that are probably important for their long term benefit, and other ways of cholesterol lowering probably don‚Äôt have these benefits. So great that you‚Äôre a platelet donor, but any CV risk reduction is likely to be minimal. Best to address the other treatable risk factors. With regard to Plavix/clopidogrel, we know that if you have a moderate-high CV risk, then low dose aspirin has a small benefit. It also has a small bleeding risk, so you need to have a high enough CV risk for the total benefit to outweigh the bleeding concern. And aspirin has been shown to have other benefits, such as reducing the likelihood of dying form bowel cancer (probably because the dangerous polyps are detected and treated at an earlier stage). So obviously people might assume theat the same benefit would exist for clopidogrel. And maybe it does, but we can‚Äôt be sure without a specific study. So my suggestion is to look at your overall risk profile - there are plenty of on line calculators (e.g. Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score\n). Then maybe ‚Äòadd a bit‚Äô for your family history - this is not usually included in these calculators, as too hard to quantify (e.g. t depends so much on the age and the number of your first degree relatives that have had CV events, whether they were smokers, and whether any strokes were ischaemia or bleeds‚Ä¶just to name a few issues). Lifestyle factors are always worth treating, and depending on your personal risk profile/calculation think about a statin and/or aspirin. If you can‚Äôt tolerate aspirin (very cheap), but are high risk, then maybe the cost of clopidogrel could be justified (I‚Äôm doubtful). I hope this helps you think about things."}

{"_id": "30f43768", "question": "What are the solutions on water pollution?", "answers": "A very important question, with so many aspects.\nFirst there are ditches, canals, rivers, lakes and the sea. Then are many kinds of pollution, and they can behave different. And allso there are several ways pollution ends up in the water.\nLet‚Äôs break this down. The pollution (I assume you‚Äôre talking about) comes from humans. The main sources are houses, industrial activities, transport and mining. The polution can be mineral, chemical or biologal. Humans have a habit of cleaning everything with water. In times there were no detergents and complex chemicals and there were not so many people, that was not a big deal.\nNowadays most pollution can be prevented by using less toxic substances and waste water treatment. The treatment has to be able to take out or neutralize de pollution. Biological waste (like faeces) in small amounts is no big problem, but in large amounts the rotting proces can take all the oxygen out of the water and kill all life. In the oceans this will allmost never happen, because it becomes diluted. But treatment costs money, and in many countrys this will take a huge amount of effort.\nIn countries that allready have waste water treatment there are often still many things to improve. E.g. in many countries waste-water of big areas is treated in large plants, but water from roofs is on the same sewerage-system. That can cause the treatment-plant to be flushed when there is heavy rainfall.\nTo top this all off strict legislation is needed. Important is the ban on non-biodegradable plastics, and preventing ships dumping bilge-oil and other waste in the sea.\nA difficult problem is toxicm (mineral) waste-water from mining. This is hard to take out of the water and (often) governments that share in the profit don‚Äôt give a damn."}

{"_id": "c03dd7d2", "question": "How does a stroke effect the optical nerve?", "answers": "Pretty much how any stroke (ischemic infarct of the nervous system) affects nerves in the brain, spinal cord, or even peripheral nerves. The nerves die. Because the blood supply was cut off. By the occlusion of the arteries that supply oxygenated blood to that nerve or nerves.\nIn the case of the ‚Äúoptic nerve‚Äù that would be mostly the posterior ciliary arteries, a set of small arteries that supply blood to the optic nerve as its fibers leave the back of the eye on their way to the brain.\nSometimes only half of the arteries are blocked, more commonly the upper half, and that creates a partial stroke of the optic nerve. If this occurs, the patient loses half of the vision in only one optic nerve (in the case I described, it would be the lower half) and that is called an ‚Äúaltitudinal defect‚Äù. It looks as though someone drew a straight horizontal line across the patient's vision in that eye, and blacked out the entire lower half (can happen with the upper half also)."}
