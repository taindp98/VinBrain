{"_id": "04b39743", "question": "Why is Covid-19 causing strokes in otherwise healthy people under 50?", "answers": "Covid-19 is a multi-organ disease.\nFirst, the molecule, called ACE-2, which the virus uses to dock to the cells of the human body, is present on many different cell types. Hence it can enter the cells of different organs directly.\nSecond, one of the cell types the virus can enter, are the cells of the inner wall of blood vessels (endothelium). If a virus enters a cell and replicates there, the cell usually gets destroyed at the end (by the virus and/or the immune system). This means: wall-of-blood-vessel cells get destroyed. The destruction of blood vessels is a very strong trigger for blood clotting which in turn can cause congestion of the blood vessel. A closed blood vessel can cause an infarction in the tissue downstream (if there are no other blood vessels transporting blood there, too) as there is no glucose and oxygen anymore which any cell needs to function and survive. To cut this long story short: In addition to directly attacking many different organs, the virus causing Covid-19 can cause damage in all organs as it can damage blood vessels and this way cause a vasculitis.\n“Briefly, necropsy and post-mortem biopsies of decedents with COVID-19 reveal macro and microvascular thrombosis involving arteries, veins, arterioles, capillaries and venules in all major organs” (from: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11239-020-02230-4\n, you need to scroll down to “Vascular endothelial cell pathology in COVID-19”).\nAn infarction in the brain is called stroke (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke\n).\nThere doesn’t necessarily need to be an underlying condition or pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors for that to happen in Covid-19."}

My doctors looked at me, referred me to a cardiologist for another test, which was negative, and told me to go on my way. “The chance of you having a subsequent stroke is very small,” they assured me.\nSix months later, I was back in the hospital with another one. =(\nAbout six months after THAT, I was able to peer out from beneath my lead jacket of fatigue and pick my head up enough to wonder WHY I’d had a second one. It’d be nice to figure it out, I wagered, to prevent a third one. At that point, I’d already decided that if I had another one, JUST LET ME DIE.\nMy speech therapist referred me to a neurologist at the big city hospital nearby. In retrospect, he was nuts, but he did decide to perform a test just to check for certain that the cardiologist I’d originally seen hadn’t missed anything. (The first test, a TEE — trans esophageal echocardiogram — checked for a hole in my heart by sticking a camera down my throat look to look at my heart. The second test, a TCD — transcranial doppler — shot minuscule bubbles into my arm via an IV and listened to my brain to see if any of them made it up there.) Lo and behold, it dinged! I had a hole in my heart that allowed bubbles/clots/etc to pass through a ventricle and into my brain.\nBut, a week later, the neurologist called and said he wasn’t sure that the hole was the cause of my stroked. He explained that doctors usually require both a hole and a hypercoagulable disease — i.e. you need a hole in your heart and a reason to have a clot. “Why the h*ll did you have me do this test, then?” I wanted to shout.\nTo make a long story short, I decided to go ahead and have surgery to close the hole. It’s not terribly risky, but it is heart surgery. I haven’t had another stroke in 12 years, I’ve had a very good neurologist tell me that clots sometimes form in the area right around the hole *just because*, I’ve had doctors tell me to get my head screwed on straight — everybody knows a hole isnt enough without a hypercoagulable disease … I’ve pretty much just given up having any chance of ever knowing what caused my strokes.\nSo please, figure it out!

Losing weight reduces the workload. “Plus, your heart will be better able to respond to circumstances that do require more work, like exercise,” says Dr. Zusman.\nPeggy Chavez’s Tip 2: Exercise. Any activity that gets your heart pumping faster and your lungs working harder is one of the best ways to lower high blood pressure. “It improves the blood vessels’ ability to open and close, which improves blood flow,” says Dr. Zusman. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.\nPeggy Chavez’s Tip 3: Reduce your stress. Chronic stress may contribute to high blood pressure.

{"_id": "3e8c09b7", "question": "Why do people that suffer from migraines have a higher risk of stroke?", "answers": "Yes it can. There are several migraine types that can—one reporter on TV, in fact, about a year ago, had a migraine attack on screen and they thought she had a stroke. It is very common.\nTo test if it is a stroke or migraine is hard because if you have hemiplegic, one side of your body will go off-line and tests for stroke will show stroke even if that’s not what you have. It is best to get into the hospital for a doctor’s examination to see if it is a stroke or migraine.\nMigraine is an electrolyte imbalance caused by the over-activity of the sensory neurons. In a migraineur’s brain, the sensory neurons have much more connections than the same neurons in a typical non-migraine brain. This is why migraineurs tend to be overstimulated by strong bright lights, strong odors, loud sounds, more sensitive to touch, and some (like me) also are super-tasters, so more sensitive to spices.\nBecause of the hyper-reaction of the brain to sensory stimulus, it generates more voltage—voltage is communication in the brain—and that extra voltage uses more sodium. Migraineurs need more salt in their diet to counter this effect. A study showed that migraineurs lose over 50% more sodium in their urine than non-migraineurs—eating the same thing.\nMigraineurs are also glucose sensitive (carbs intolerant) because glucose removes sodium and water from cells—therefore, carbs reduce brain sodium even more for migraineurs, causing a migraine.\nRead this article: http://www.mhfmjournal.com/pdf/migraine-cause-and-treatment.pdf\n, also Functional Prodrome in Migraines\nand this book about migraines \"Fighting The Migraine Epidemic: Complete Guide: How to Treat & Prevent Migraines Without Medicines\" and you will find answers all your questions.\nThere is also this video that is very educational: Episode 109: Angela Stanton - Is Your Diet Giving You Migraines?

If you turn a monkeys stable dominance hierarchy on its head the end result is enough social stress that provokes a stress response and an overactive sympathetic nervous system.\nOverall, the monkeys under the most social stress were most likely to form these dangerous plaques.\nLast but not least, once these plaques are formed in the blood vessels, chronic stress may cause increase blood pressure.

{"_id": "51804d8c", "question": "Why does cracking one's neck increase the risk of stroke?", "answers": "This pops up in the news frequently and has been proven false. In all cases, the stroke was in progress prior to the visit to the chiropractor. Multiple studies have been done that were unable to find a link between the two. Researchers from the Departments of Neurosurgery, at Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Loma Linda University Medical Center and The Pennsylvania State University, in conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of chiropractic neck manipulation and cervical artery dissection, found no convincing evidence to support a causal link. Further, the authors conclude that the unfounded belief in causation may lead to episodes of litigation.156Church et al. (2016) CureusWhedon et al. in a 2015 cohort study published in Spine Journal found that, “among Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years with an office visit for a neuro-musculoskeletal problem, risk of injury to the head, neck, or trunk within 7 days was 76 percent lower among subjects with a chiropractic office visit than among those who saw a primary care physician.”157Whedon et al. (2015) Spine JournalIn a separate 2015 cohort study, Whedon et al. found that “among Medicare B beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years with neck pain, incidence of vertebrobasilar stroke was extremely low. Small differences in risk between patients who saw a chiropractor and those who saw a primary care physician are probably not clinically significant.”158Whedon et al. (2015) Journal of Manipulative andPhysiological TherapeuticsThe results of a case-control study in U.S. commercial and Medicare Advantage patient populations by Kosloff et al. concluded, “We found no significant association between exposure to chiropractic care and the risk of vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) stroke. We conclude that manipulation is an unlikely cause of VBA stroke. The positive association between primary care provider (PCP) visits and VBA stroke is most likely due to patient decisions to seek care for the symptoms (headache and neck pain) of arterial dissection.

Could the Nazi Party survive an economic collapse? What am I talking about?\nThe German government, under Nazi Party leadership and control, had perpetrated a huge fraud on the German people. When they took power in 1933, German government debt was about 10 billion Reichsmarks and unemployment was over 30%.\nSome of their immediate actions in 1933 included privatization of several state-owned businesses and imposing tariffs on imports. These sound like normal actions in a bad economy, right? But, the German economy wasn’t that bad off. In fact, it was recovering from the initial shock of the Great Depression. But, that wasn’t good enough so…\nThey ‘helped’ reduce unemployment (a little) by forcing Jewish educators, workers, civil servants, and business owners out of the workforce. This left some room for non-Jewish Germans.\nThey banned political opposition to get their plans through and then banned all unions. Workers had to get permission to quit a job and employers had to get permission to reduce their workforce. The Nazis gave out public works project jobs to those companies that used manual labor over labor-saving machinery.\nTo finance the military rearmament, and keep it off government spending, they created a fictional company called MEtallurgische FOrschungsgesellschaft m.b.H. (or “MEFO” for short). The Nazis then ‘persuaded’ the top 4 armament manufacturers in Germany to front 1 billion Reichsmarks. MEFO issued promissory notes to get that money with a 4-year maturity. The Nazis then discounted the notes, basically turning them into a separate currency.\nOver the next 4 years, MEFO issued 12 billion Reichsmarks in promissory notes. By the time they started coming due, the Nazi government didn’t have the money to pay the notes off. So, what did they do? They forced German banks to buy government bonds to pay off the promissory notes.\nWhere did the banks get that kind of money? Why, from depositors of course. They didn’t ask the German people if they wanted to buy 12 billion Reichsmarks in dubious government bonds. Oh, and the non-MEFO debt the government was carrying in 1938 was closer to $19 billion instead of the $10 billion they had inherited.\nIn 1939, the guy who originally came up with the idea at the Ministry of Finance was forced to resign. It was a massive scam that put the German economy deep in debt and bordering on collapse.\nSo, what saved it? In a word: plunder.\nConfiscating the personal and business wealth of German Jews was a start but certainly not enough. So, off to war to plunder Poland. Then other nations of Europe.\nIf, as you ask Hitler dies before summer 1939, would the invasion of Poland go on without him? Well, all of the invasion elements were in place once the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed 23 August 1939. This pact allowed Germany to invade Poland without triggering an immediate response from the Red Army.\nOn the other hand, the Anglo-Polish Military Alliance - signed on 25 August 1939 - did force Germany to pause the planned invasion of Poland from the 26th to 1 September. Hitler ordered the invasion anyway but would that have happened if his successor was (a) not solidly in control and (b) confident enough to attack anyway. Any less confidence and it could be called off.\nEarlier in the summer before the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement is in place? I doubt the invasion happens. Nazi plans probably lose steam at that point.\nNazis did believe ‘war’ was the “primary engine of human progress” [Wikipedia: Economy of Nazi Germany] but did all of the Nazi leadership believe it enough to risk war? Many in the German Army were not certain the invasion could work. Others were convinced. So, I suspect it depends upon who landed where in those top leadership posts. Which of the political types maneuvered their way into key positions?\nAnd, back to the economy… I guess the Nazis could have kept patching the economy with debt for some years but it would eventually fail. Anyone who knew how it really worked would have pushed for war to ‘fix’ the debt problem.\nSo, it depends.\nEconomy of Nazi Germany - Wikipedia\nNational economy of Nazi Germany Like many other Western nations, Germany suffered the economic effects of the Great Depression with unemployment soaring around the Wall Street Crash of 1929 . [1] When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he introduced policies aimed at improving the economy. The changes included privatization of state industries, autarky (national economic self-sufficiency) and tariffs on imports. Weekly earnings increased by 19% in real terms from 1933 to 1939, [2] but this was largely due to employees working longer hours, while the hourly wage rates remained close to the lowest levels reached during the Great Depression. [3] In addition, reduced foreign trade meant rationing in consumer goods like poultry, fruit, and clothing for many Germans. [4] The Nazis believed in war as the primary engine of human progress, and argued that the purpose of a country's economy should be to enable that country to fight and win wars of expansion. As such, almost immediately after coming to power, they embarked on a vast program of military rearmament , which quickly dwarfed civilian investment. [6] During the 1930s, Nazi Germany increased its military spending faster than any other state in peacetime, [7] and the military eventually came to represent the majority of the German economy in the 1940s. [8] This was funded mainly through deficit financing before the war, and the Nazis expected to cover their debt by plundering the wealth of conquered nations during and after the war. [9] Such plunder did occur, but its results fell far short of Nazi expectations. [10] The Nazi government developed a partnership with leading German business interests, who supported the goals of the regime and its war effort in exchange for advantageous contracts, subsidies, and the suppression of the trade union movement. [11] Cartels and monopolies were encouraged at the expense of small businesses, even though the Nazis had received considerable electoral support from small business owners. [12] Nazi Germany maintained a supply of slave labor , composed of prisoners and concentration camp inmates, which was greatly expanded after the beginning of World War II . In Poland alone, some five million people (including Polish Jews) were used as slave labor throughout the war. [13] Among the slave laborers in the occupied territories, hundreds of thousands were used by leading German corporations including Thyssen , Krupp , IG Farben , Bosch , Blaupunkt , Daimler-Benz , Demag , Henschel , Junkers , Messerschmitt , Siemens , and Volkswagen , as well as Dutch corporation Philips . [14] By 1944, slave labor made up one quarter of Germany's entire work force, and the majority of German factories had a contingent of prisoners. [15] Pre-war economy: 1933–1939 [ edit ] Recovery and rearmament [ edit ] The Nazis came to power in the midst of the Great Depression . The unemployment rate at that point in time was close to 30%. [17] At first, the new Nazi government\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany\nMEFO - Wikipedia\nMEFO was the more common abbreviation for ( German : MEtallurgische FOrschungsgesellschaft m.b.H. , English: Society for Metallurgical Research LLC ), [1] a dummy company set up by the Nazi German government to finance the German re-armament effort in the years prior to World War II . Origins [ edit ] This dummy company was set up in May 1933, just after appointment of Hjalmar Schacht as Reichsbank President in March 1933, as a front for purchases from four German armament manufacturers, Krupp , Siemens , Gutehoffnungshütte , and Rheinmetall . The four were persuaded to put up the initial share capital of 250,000 Reichsmarks . [2] The German government was not openly involved in any way; on paper, MEFO was entirely a private company, in reality, the company had two directors, one appointed by the Reich Ministry of Defence and the other by the Reichsbank. The four companies pooled together over 1 billion Reichsmark (equivalent to 4 billion 2017 euros) where the National Socialist government agreed to repay the money with five-year promissory notes known as Mefo bills . [3] [4] Soon afterwards, the Nazis discounted these notes (known in German as Mefo-Wechsel), basically turning them into a type of currency. [5] Between 1934 and 1938, Mefo bills worth a total of 12 billion Reichsmark were issued to pay for rearmament. To put that into context, Germany's national debt in 1932, the year before Hitler took power, was only 10 billion Reichsmark. By 1938 the official admitted national debt was 19 billion Reichsmark -- but the Reichsmark 12 billion in Mefo bills has to be added on top of that. In other words, Hitler and the German Minister of Economics , Hjalmar Schacht, tripled Germany's national debt in just six years, but more than half of the increase was off the books. When the MEFO notes fell due in 1938, the government discovered a serious cash shortage. To resolve the problem, the Nazi regime employed “highly dubious methods” where “banks were forced to buy government bonds to be used to repay these bills, and the government took money from savings accounts and insurance companies. This made the ordinary German citizen the financier of the German rearmament.” [6] Eventually, the government had to resort to the printing press to help mitigate the cash shortage. It was one of the key components of Germany's rearmament program and was invented by Hjalmar Schacht, who then was head of the Ministry of Economics, and Plenipotentiary for the War Economy. After assuming power in 1933, the National Socialists realized that rearming Germany would require funds that were not likely to be generated from taxes or public loans. In addition, the need to keep the rearmament effort secret led to the creation of this dummy company. Transactions [ edit ] The transactions that led to the re-armament financing were conducted as follows [7] Armaments manufacturers were contracted to produce arms Mefo bills of exchange were drawn by these contractors as payment for th\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEFO\nMolotov–Ribbentrop Pact - Wikipedia\n1939 neutrality pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union \"German–Soviet pact\" redirects here. For the Weimar-era German–Soviet non-aggression pact, see Treaty of Berlin (1926) . The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that enabled those two powers to partition Poland between them. The pact was signed in Moscow on 23 August 1939 by German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov [1] and was officially known as the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . [2] [3] Unofficially it has also been referred to as the Hitler–Stalin Pact , [4] [5] Nazi–Soviet Pact [6] or Nazi–Soviet Alliance [7] (although it was not a formal alliance ). [8] [9] Its clauses provided a written guarantee of peace by each party towards the other and a commitment that declared that neither government would ally itself to or aid an enemy of the other. In addition to the publicly-announced stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included the Secret Protocol, which defined the borders of Soviet and German spheres of influence across Poland , Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia and Finland . The secret protocol also recognised the interest of Lithuania in the Vilnius region , and Germany declared its complete disinterest in Bessarabia . The rumour of the existence of the Secret Protocol was proved only when it was made public during the Nuremberg Trials . [10] Soon after the pact, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin ordered the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September, one day after a Soviet–Japanese ceasefire came into effect after the Battles of Khalkhin Gol . After the invasions, the new border between the two countries was confirmed by the supplementary protocol of the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty . In March 1940, parts of the Karelia and Salla regions, in Finland, were annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War . That was followed by the Soviet annexation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and parts of Romania ( Bessarabia , Northern Bukovina and the Hertza region ). Concern for ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had been used as pretexts for the Soviets' invasion of Poland. Stalin's invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact since it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence that had been agreed with the Axis. [12] The territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union after the 1939 Soviet invasion east of the Curzon line remained in the Soviet Union after the war ended and are now in Ukraine and Belarus . Vilnius was given to Lithuania. Only Podlaskie and a small part of Galicia east of the San River , around Przemyśl , were returned to Poland . Of all the other territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939 to 1940, those detached from Finland (Western Karelia , Petsamo ), Estonia ( Estonian Ingria and Petseri County ) and Latvia ( Abrene ) remain part of Russia , the successor state\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact\nAnglo-Polish military alliance - Wikipedia\nThe military alliance between the United Kingdom and Poland was formalised by the Anglo-Polish Agreement in 1939, with subsequent addenda of 1940 and 1944, [1] for mutual assistance in case of a military invasion from Germany, as specified in a secret protocol. [2] [3] [4] British assurance to Poland [ edit ] On 31 March 1939, in response to Nazi Germany 's defiance of the Munich Agreement and its occupation of Czechoslovakia , [5] in Parliament, the United Kingdom pledged the support of itself and France to assure Polish independence: ...in the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence, and which the Polish Government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty's Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Polish Government all support in their power. They have given the Polish Government an assurance to this effect. I may add that the French Government have authorised me to make it plain that they stand in the same position in this matter as do His Majesty's Government. [6] The British Chiefs of Staff at the time however noted that \"we could give no direct help by land, sea or air.\" [7] On 6 April, during a visit to London by the Polish foreign minister , it was agreed to formalise the assurance as an Anglo-Polish military alliance, pending negotiations. [8] [9] The text of the \"Anglo-Polish Communiqué\" stated that the two governments were \"in complete agreement on certain general principles\" and that it was \"agreed that the two countries were prepared to enter into an agreement of permanent and reciprocal character...\". The British Blue Book for 1939 indicates that formal agreement was not signed until 25 August. [10] That assurance was extended on 13 April to Greece and Romania , after Italy 's invasion of Albania . [11] Agreement of Mutual Assistance [ edit ] On 25 August, two days after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact , the Agreement of Mutual Assistance between the United Kingdom and Poland was signed. The agreement contained promises of mutual military assistance between the nations if either was attacked by some \"European country\". The United Kingdom, sensing a trend of German expansionism , sought to discourage German aggression by this show of solidarity. In a secret protocol of the pact, the United Kingdom offered assistance in the case of an attack on Poland specifically by Germany, [3] but in the case of attack by other countries, the parties were required only to \"consult together on measures to be taken in common\". [12] Both the United Kingdom and Poland were bound not to enter agreements with any other third countries that were a threat to the other. [13] Because of the pact's signing, Hitler postponed his planned invasion of Poland from 26 August until 1 September.

{"_id": "d6657db0", "question": "Could having a terrible argument with someone cause a stroke?", "answers": "The simple answer is “Yes.” A stroke is damage to a portion of the brain due to a rupture of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke), a localized clot in a vessel (thrombotic stroke), or a clot that travels from another part of the body, usually the heart or an artery (embolic stroke).\nArguing can sometimes get very heated. This can cause a release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are some of the chemicals the body activates as part of its “fight or flight” response to a danger or acute stress. These chemicals raise blood pressure, speed up the heart rate, and can trigger cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beats). In a patient who already has high blood pressure, their sudden release can worsen that condition to the point that it causes a stroke through a brain hemorrhage or the spasm of a cerebral artery. Even in patients without known high blood pressure, a very sudden increase in blood pressure could cause the rupture or spasm of a cerebral blood vessel, especially if that vessel is already weakened by an aneurysm (weakening in the muscular wall of an artery), or plaque (the deposition of cholesterol and calcium in the wall of an artery which can weaken it, or cause it to close off). If blood doesn’t flow through an artery, or if the artery ruptures, it will likely result in permanent damage to the portion of the brain that vessel supplies with blood, which is what a stroke is.\nA cardiac arrhythmia can also result in a stroke due to the temporary interruption of blood flow to a cerebral artery. These stress chemicals may also cause a sudden heart attack, which could reduce blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.\nIncidentally, stress can also cause the body to produce another adrenal hormone from the adrenal cortex known as cortisol. The effects of cortisol are generally not as acute, but tend to me more prolonged. It is certainly conceivable that chronic arguments could also lead the body to make more cortisol which can raise blood pressure.\nThere is also a phenomenon known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) which is caused by a temporary interruption of blood supply without permanent damage to the portion of the brain whose blood supply comes from that artery. This is commonly known as a “mini-stroke,” which could also be caused by a heated argument for the same reasons as stated above, and resolves without a permanent deficit.\nThere are countless stories of individuals who had strokes, or heart attacks after a sudden stress, which could include a heated argument."}

On the other hand benefits of massage therapy are also well documented .\nIn a nutshell - side effects are rare but possible .\nCareful selection of trained massage professional is a must .\nFull medical history , any medication intake and any medical or surgical concerns must be shared and risks disclosed between both giver and receiver of the massage .\nFor academic purpose here is an article of interest. A must read .\nSixteen case reports and four case series of adverse events after massage therapy were found. Massage was frequently used for rheumatological conditions. In the majority of these cases causality is established con- vincingly, for instance, through the sequence or nature of events. Some of the adverse effects relate to serious complications.\nConsidering the popularity of massage therapy, the number of reported adverse events seems minute. How- ever, this could be due to under-reporting. In a related area (spinal manipulation) we have, for instance, shown that under-reporting of serious adverse events is close to 100%\nClearly, one should differentiate between various approaches. The above findings suggest that massage by non-professional and forceful techniques like shiatsu, urut and Rolfing are relatively often associated with adverse events. The reports reviewed above are often incomplete. For instance, the background of the therapist and the type of massage therapy are not always described. This further limits the conclusiveness of the evidence.\nSeveral systematic reviews of controlled clinical trials testing the effectiveness of massage therapies have been published and have arrived at cautiously positive conclusions . However, too few clinical trials of massage therapy exist and many of its claims are not backed up by evidence. Thus adequate risk–benefit evaluations are not feasible.\nIn conclusion, massage therapies are not totally devoid of risks. The incidence of adverse events is unknown, but probably low.\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1a78/74937ebe08d54fc4e195fdacf838399f4ffe.pdf"}
{"_id": "79cbeba7", "question": "Does a stroke cause permanent brain damage?", "answers": "I had a major stroke at age 52 which changed my life forever. My right side was paralyzed from head to foot, and I lost my speech. I had daily physical, occupational and speech therapy for a long time and off and on again for years after that first year and still to this date to keep me functioning. I still cannot walk well after 26 years because my ankle never recovered. My car still has to have a left-fooot accelerator so I can't rent a car which limits traveling. I won't go in to all the details.\nYes a stroke does cause permanent brain damage because the stroke continues for around 48 hours destroying more of your brain by either depriving it of oxygen or flooding it with blood.\nAnother result which I happened to suffer is RSD, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. now known as Complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS. That is horrible. Intractable pain more severe than anything anyone can believe. It is the result of trauma, in this case brain trauma.\nThis may be more than you were looking for but if you were wondering if your brain gets all better by a certain time and things go back to normal, NO. Maybe you're wondering if someone you know will ever be the same. I have lots of residual issues which people can't see but I have to deal with. People having a major stroke like mine can kiss their paychecks good bye. You can no longer do the work you did before. And likely never will. But I'd say I'm doing pretty good for having half a brain!"}
{"_id": "61a2197d", "question": "After a stroke caused by a clot, how long does the blood clot remain in the brain?", "answers": "There is an adage that when something involves the brain, it's like real estate - it's all location, location and location. Even with the evolution of intracranial bleeds, location (what space they occur in) is important. The Question suggests it is about intracerebral bleeds (blood within the brain itself, instead of around it), so I will answer accordingly.\nAll clot within the brain eventually reabsorbs, if the patient lives long enough. There is much variability in how long this takes, but in general, the larger the clot, the longer it takes.\nA small \"bruise\" may disappear in a week or two on CT or MRI. A larger clot may take 3 - 6 weeks to clear. The really big ones may clear in terms of their density on CT, but will show permanent MRI changes and leave a cavity and distorted residual brain behind.\nPlease keep in mind that if you look hard enough (for example, using PET scanning, or post-mortem fine histology) you can find identifiable residua more often and for a longer time.\nAlso keep in mind that such structural evaluations have only a weak relation to how well the brain functions around the clot, and how quickly recovery of that function takes place.\nAnyone who has been in this business long enough will remember a patient with normal CT and MRI who nevertheless exhibits a deep and prolonged coma. On the other hand, we occasionally see surprisingly good function in patients with impressive clots in so-called \"non-silent\" parts of the brain.\nIt's amazing I think to see how the body has a sense of what tissue belongs where and in what quantities - even in the brain, which is more isolated from healing and immunological cells than other organs.\nHope this helps!"}

{"_id": "5cf4b8a0", "question": "Can chiropractic adjustments induce stroke?", "answers": "I don’t know where the other two answers got their information, other than perhaps anecdotally. The FACTS are that the likelihood of a person having a stroke in a chiropractor’s office are no greater than having one in a medical doctor’s office. A Review of the Literature Regarding\nStroke\nand Chiropractic\nThe myth that chiropractors cause strokes is (1) based upon a misunderstanding of the difference between correlation and causation, and (2) by the American Medical Association’s organized effort to destroy an honorable profession whose philosophy is to avoid drugs and surgery by finding and correcting the underlying cause of a health issue. (The latter was validated by a Federal Court finding the AMA guilty of those charges.)\nLook, the malpractice insurance premiums paid by chiropractors to insurance companies is orders of magnitude less expensive than premiums paid by medical doctors. Do you think those companies are just being nice, or is it more likely that more people are hurt and/or die in the hands of medical doctors? How do the critics explain that???\nThe elephant in the room is a recent study by John Hopkins University which concluded that on average 250,000 people die EVERY YEAR IN THE USA due to “iatrogenic causes,” meaning incorrect medical diagnosis or treatment. QUOTE: “ Analyzing medical death rate data over an eight-year period, Johns Hopkins patient safety experts have calculated that more than 250,000 deaths per year are due to medical error in the U.S. Their figure, published May 3 in The BMJ, surpasses the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's third leading cause of death—respiratory disease, which kills close to 150,000 people per year.” Johns Hopkins study suggests medical errors are third-leading\ncause\nof death in U.S.\nAnd yet, if even one person dies while receiving chiropractic treatment (which is not the same as being CAUSED by chiropractic treatment) it’s front page news.\nOpen your eyes people. Health, in many cases, comes from identifying and correcting the underlying cause of disease not from a bottle of pills or removal of organs."}

{"_id": "99e7baf6", "question": "How can migraines cause a stroke?", "answers": "So sorry to hear of this, OP!\nFor various reasons, I track migraine and stroke related research. A lot of that research seems to have been conducted on women. The summary of all I know so far is as follows:\n1. There is a known correlation between migraine with aura and the risk of stroke.\n2. A stroke can induce a migraine or occur in the course of a migraine, and in the latter case can lead to a full stroke.\n3. A migraine can induce a stroke if other underlying conditions for a stroke exist and interact with the pathologies caused or precipitated by a migraine.\n4. Stroke due to cardiovascular disease may look like a migraine.\n5. Both stroke and migraine can share a pathology or underlying brain or neurological disfunction (which are still less than well understood).\n6. Many migraine related strokes cannot be classified clearly. For instance: tryptans, which are often prescribed to migraine sufferers and whose action is vasoconstrictive, may interact with the migraine pathology and precipitate a stroke.\nAny or some of these may explain your experience but it appears what we know is less than adequate. One of my pet peeves is how underfunded migraine research is although an estimated 7-10% of the UK population suffers from it. Pathology being poorly understood means hardly any material on prevention (except hit and miss food triggers), little understanding from health care providers, awful management of pain and other side effects. I have so far heard of one specialist who works on the cusp of neurology, pain pathology and specialisation in migraine (and no, the person who told me couldn't remember his name either!).\nWishing you good health.

In some states, it depends.\nPeople v. Spragney\nin California was one:\nThe facts concerning the accident, which resulted in the death of a 10-year-old girl, are tragic but brief. At about 8:45 a.m. on July 7, 1970, defendant speeded through a red light at the corner of Santa Barbara and Broadway in Los Angeles. He collided with a Volkswagen in which the victim was a passenger.\nCourt papers say that Isaiah Spragney crawled out of overturned car. He \"staggered and appeared unable to maintain his balance\":\nHis coordination was wild. There was no pattern to the way he used his hands. His movements were both rapid and slow. His eyes were wide open, and his pupils constricted. He had a fixed stare. His speech was slow, slurred and not understandable. He was smiling, laughing, and muttering. His responses were rambling and unintelligent.\nBecause Spragney had a seizure.\nProsecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter.\nA jury found him guilty. He got a year in jail.\nSpragney asked for a new trial. His motion was denied. So his lawyer, future Superior Court Judge G. Thomas Thompson\n, appealed…\n…And won.\nSaid the Court:\nThe prosecution's initial theory that defendant was driving under the influence of a drug was pretty well destroyed by the medical evidence.\nThe Court agreed that \"unquestionably unconsciousness was a defense to the charge\" under California law, Pen. Code, § 26, subd. 5:\nThe only legal basis for a finding of fault on the part of defendant was the weak inference that he was, or should have been aware of medical reasons why he ought not to drive an automobile.\nCalifornia Jury Instructions include No. 4.30:\na \"person who \"unconscious commits what would otherwise be a criminal act, is not guilty of a crime\nand No. 4.31\n\"If the evidence raises a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in fact conscious, you must find that he was then unconscious\".\nIn this case, the Court applied the defense of unconsciousness based on a seizure caused by psychomotor epilepsy.\nAlas, things went less smoothly for Ashlie M., a teenage girl who killed pedestrian Pedro Beliz as she drove home from work in 2007.\nAshlie had a California learner's permit. She wasn't supposed to be driving.\nShe claimed she had a blackout at some point and could not remember much of the accident she caused. Her lawyer said she was entitled to the “unconscious” defense because she was unconscious.\nThe People were merciful. Amazingly,\nAppellant was cited for vehicular manslaughter, unlicensed driver, and failure to provide proof of insurance, but the District Attorney's office chose to file only one count of driving without a license.\nAs punishment, The People ordered Ashlie to pay for Pedro Beliz's funeral.\nMore amazingly…\nAshlie's lawyer objected.\nHe said Pedro Beliz was dead because he was walking on a dark street at night wearing dark clothing. This was his fault. Why should she pay for his burial?\nThe Court disagreed:\nThe trial court found as a matter of fact that “the minor's lack of skill, her inexperience, ․ played a role in this.” The evidence supports the juvenile court's finding.  Appellant was unprepared for the common traffic encounter with a bicyclist, was unable to control the car despite traveling at only 37 miles per hour, and never even knew she hit the pedestrian. Her actions and omissions cannot be explained away by blaming the pedestrian (as she does) for being there wearing dark clothing and the city for the absence of streetlights.\nIt's all in here: In re: Ashlie M.\nThat's the rule in California. But every state is different.\nWhen it comes to paying damages, I have seen guilty drivers escape judgments by filing for personal bankruptcy. An injury caused by willful or malicious conduct is not dischargeable. An innocent mistake? Perhaps."}

{"_id": "3727cb6f", "question": "How do babies get stroke?", "answers": "That's a great question because as you may be aware, neonates (babies within the first month of life) have a much higher rate of suffering a stroke than older babies/children.\nThe reason they suffer from stroke during this period is largely unknown but there are a few causes we know of for sure (note: although there are known causes, often when it happens you don't know which of the causes it may be). Regarding causes, I'll break it down to causes of the types of stroke. There are two types: the one where the artery gets clogged (thrombotic stroke) and the one where the artery bleeds out (hemorrhagic stroke). Thrombotic stroke is more common in neonates and adults alike.\nThrombotic stroke: Firstly, clots can form in the placenta and be transported to the baby's blood vessels both in utero and during childbirth. Other causes during pregnancy are poorly controlled diabetes, high blood pressure (preeclampsia), certain infections (especially with high fever), illicit drug use, PROM (premature rupture of the membranes - when the water breaks too soon), and when the placenta separates from the uterine wall (abrupt placentae). Childbirth itself poses a risk. The birthing process is traumatic and much pressure is exerted on the baby's head, this can cause clots to form. This is worse with vacuum extractions and forceps deliveries. Deliveries with complications where the baby is deprived of oxygen are also a potential cause. At birth, they are born with a high percentage of red blood cells and this can clog the arteries as well. In addition, breastfed babies tend to get mildly dehydrated after childbirth because mom's milk hasn't come in yet, just a bit of colostrum - so the blood thickens further, increasing the risk of clotting. Causes that have nothing to do with pregnancy or childbirth may include clotting disorders that don't prevent/stop blood clotting, sickle cell anemia, heart defects, certain genetic disorders heart disease, and certain infections like chickenpox or meningitis.\nHemorrhagic stroke: Preemies are particularly susceptible to this type of stroke because their arteries and veins are not fully developed so they are extremely fragile. They can easily break or tear, causing the blood to leak out. And the aforementioned birthing trauma can lead to damage to the vascular system also, causing hemorrhagic stroke as well, particularly relating to head injuries sustained as a result. Blood vessel defects (including aneurysms) and blood clotting disorders that prevent the blood from clotting (eg. Von Willibrand's disease, haemophilia, Factor XIII deficiency) are also potential causes.\nBut as I said the vast majority of the time the cause is unknown. So I guess the answer to your question is nobody knows but it could be a million things..."}

{"_id": "aae88a79", "question": "What causes cylinder pressure to be below the atmosphere during the intake stroke?", "answers": "The piston is drawing a vacuum to pull in the intake charge (air and fuel mixture).\nAs the piston lowers, the cylinder volume increases. Air must flow into the cylinder to fill the larger space. The pressure drop below atmospheric is due to air moving by the intake and valves to fill the expanding cylinder volume.\nIf the cylinder were fully open on top, the pressure drop would be relatively low. This is one reason, with very wild camshafts that the intake vacuum is not adequate to operate accessories (vacuum distributor advance, vacuum power brakes, etc). The long duration of the camshaft allows the airflow to be far less restricted and thus lower pressure drop.\nOriginal Question:\n“What causes cylinder pressure to be below the atmosphere during the intake stroke?”"}

{"_id": "0832e9d7", "question": "Can anxiety cause a heart attack or a stroke?", "answers": "Anxiety can definitely make worse already pre-existing heart diseases. Typical anxiety progress in the way that it triggers flight/fight response. This leads to flooding of the bloodstream by hormones activating a whole range of adaptations to such situations.\nBasically, all unnecessary processes — like digestion & higher-level cognition are switched off — whereas muscles including the heart get most of the blood supply. It automatically leads to activation of the cardiovascular center that stimulates sympathetic innervation in the heart.\nThis is where things become interesting. Increased sympathetic heart activation leads to a much higher heart rate and stroke volume what dramatically increases the heart minute output. This sharply increased demand on the heart can trigger a whole range of pre-existing heart conditions and diseases.\nHeart palpitations.\nAtrial fibrillations.\nAngina pectoris.\nHeart infarction. It is a quite dangerous situation.\nDeadly ventricular tachycardias: Torsades de Pointes arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Those are quite dangerous too.\nThere is good news. It is known that you can hit those two birds — heart infarction & anxiety — by one stone. It can be accomplished by the proper diet of our great grandmothers, which heals large intestine, stop inflammation there and subsequently in the body including arteries, and which substantially elevates the level of the precursor of serotonin (produced by healthy bacteria).\nAs simple as this it can become :-)"}
{"_id": "853fb289", "question": "Can single strokes cause progressive dementia?", "answers": "Short answer: No. Vascular lesions of the brain may result in dementia, but usually only in the presence of multiple strokes.\nLong answer:\nA single stroke generally doesn't cause progressive cognitive decline[1]. However, multiple insults over a period of time (usually spanning years) will result in diffuse damage to the brain, and patients can lose function in stepwise fashion, which mimics the progressive decline of what is popularly considered \"dementia\". Treatment is oriented towards prevention of future vascular events, generally by controlling stroke risk factors. Examples of pathology include:\nblood vessel diseases\nhypertensive hemorrhages\namyloid angiopathy\ncardiac emboli (clots)\npost-ischemic diffuse brain damage\n[1] It can, however, cause global disturbances in behavior or memory which can be misinterpreted as dementia by those not trained in neurology. For instance:\nAnterior cerebral artery infarcts may result in abulia and generalized apathy usually associated with difficulty in planning future tasks.\nMiddle cerebral artery infarcts may cause aphasias or hemineglect.\nPosterior cerebral artery infarcts may result in visual agnosias, cortical blindness, achromatopsia, prosopagnosia, or amnesia in bilateral disease.\nVery unlucky infarcts that affect certain sensitive regions of the brain, such as the medial thalamic region, may also result in severe, non-progressive memory disturbances after one ischemic event."}

{"_id": "15ebe78f", "question": "The nurse said that raises insulin can cause a stroke. Does that mean it's better to eat less carbohydrates than it is to use medicine to lower blood glucose?", "answers": "Thanks for the A2A.\nI’m not sure about insulin and strokes. I checked the literature and didn’t find anything that corroborates what your nurse said. I do know, however, that uncontrolled diabetes raises your risk of having a stroke. So, if you have been prescribed insulin, you should take it as your doctor tells you to.\nAnyone who has diabetes should be careful about their sugar/carbohydrate intake. Ideally, you should try to limit simple carbs like soda, white bread and rice, and sweets. Not all carbohydrates are bad for diabetics. Complex carbs like those you find in whole grain breads, unsweetened granola, and beans — those are good for you in moderate amounts. These kinds of carbohydrates digest more slowly, so they don’t cause your blood sugar to jump as high as things like soda or sugary foods (simple carbs).\nOf course, as a diabetic and as someone who is taking insulin, you should always be sure to have some glucose tablets at your disposal. You can find them at the drug store and they look something like this:\nBeing on insulin raises your risk for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This can happen if you accidentally take too much insulin, or if your blood sugar is lower than usual and you take the prescribed amount of insulin. It’s not uncommon for people who are on insulin to have their blood sugar drop too low. If this happens, you may feel lightheaded, anxious, sweaty, and jittery. You could even faint. This is very dangerous. These tablets can help if that happens. You should carry them in your purse, in your car, and have some in your kitchen and/or bedroom. Orange juice or soda is also good for quickly raising your blood sugar if it drops too low. But I like these tablets because they are easy to carry and they work really quickly.\nHope this helps,\nDr. Paul"}

{"_id": "6a0c6859", "question": "What is the most common cardiac cause for a stroke?", "answers": "Other answers say atrial fibrillation. But that’s only indirectly correct.\nA Fib makes it more likely you will have a stroke, but the majority don’t have one.\nAtrial fib predisposes to forming clots in the heart (in the lt. atrial appendage), and they can break loose, go through the blood (carotid artery) and stop in the brain, causing an embolic/ischemic stroke.\nSo arterial embolus is the correct answer—with atrial fib being the most common predisposing cause."}
{"_id": "fea4ff45", "question": "How long does it take for a stroke to cause brain damage?", "answers": "4 minutes due to the lack of oxygen.\nWith ischemic strokes the blood clot or emboli that blocks the blood flow to the part or parts of the brain to oxygenate the brain. Small strokes are small because it affects a smaller part of the brain; where large strokes can involve multiple lobes of the brain, even.\nWith hemorrhagic strokes the blood that escapes the blood vessel is damaging to the brain tissue.

Remember, any medical intervention, any pharmaceutical intervention, anything that doctors do to you has some risk. Goodness, even taking aspirin kills people!\nBTW, tune out the naysayers that profess that chiropractic has no medical benefit. There is a plethora of research comparing chiropractic to medical interventions for musculoskeletal conditions which unequivocally show that chiropractic at least is as effective than medical treatment, and often more beneficial.\nAnd, at least, going to your chiropractor reduces the iatrogenic possibilities of harm, greatly reduces the amount of opiates and other medications prescribed, and by reducing surgery, death."}
{"_id": "16ea8cad", "question": "Is it possible for a stroke to just cause temporary hearing loss and deafness?", "answers": "Yes, it is possible for a stroke to affect hearing.\nIn more than one way too. I’ve can recall patients who’s hearing thresholds have dropped after a stroke, and then over the duration of months, even going on to years they have gradually recovered to pre-stroke levels. Whether this is down to blood flow, which there are drugs to increase blood flow to the inner ear or temporary atrophy around the auditory nerve or spiral ganglions, as they both carry electrical impulses from the hairs cells within the cochlea. I honestly do not know what the reasons are\nThere is also as Matt Ramsey mentioned, we hear sounds with our ears, but its the brain that makes sense of those sounds. This one I’d say is more common, the brains cognitive function is often affected after a stroke and understanding speech can be more difficult due to this, especially in noise. Given time the brain often recovers and this recovery will often lead to increased cognitive processing, which will always help with understanding speech, whether that's through hearing, lip-reading or the brain filling in the blanks from all the areas of the brain that often gets used by people with hearing loss due to neural plasticity of the brain.\nThe brain is an amazing muscle responsible for many things, and like any other part of the body, when its damaged it can recover. If you are asking this question due to someone you know, their hearing has been affected and they didn’t need hearing aids before the stroke, I’d recommend Oticon OPN S, or the soon to be released Oticon More. The way these hearing aids process sound can, and does support the brain in many ways with their BrainHearing technology. I wear these and they are amazing compared to all the other hearing aids I’ve worn in the past.\nRegards\nMark"}

{"_id": "34af49e1", "question": "Is a thrombus and an embolus the same thing? If not, which causes a stroke & which causes a heart attack?", "answers": "They are not the same thing but they can lead to the same thing—ischemia—which produces strokes and heart attacks. A thrombus is a clot in an artery which causes obstruction of the artery and ischemia(low oxygen levels)—-most common cause of heart attacks. An embolus develops when a fragment of a clot in a peripheral artery breaks off and travels in the circulation to another site and causes obstruction of the circulation in the distant site, thus producing ischemia and a possible infarct. This is one of the most common causes of strokes—-for example, a clot in the carotid artery in the neck becomes unstable and a fragment breaks off and travels to the circulation in the brains producing obstruction, ischemia, and subsequently a stroke."}

{"_id": "445b9c07", "question": "What are the symptoms, causes, and warning signs of a stroke that occurs in the human body?", "answers": "Symptoms\nIf you or someone you're with may be having a stroke, pay particular attention to the time the symptoms began. Some treatment options are most effective when given soon after a stroke begins.\nSigns and symptoms of stroke include:\n1 Trouble speaking and understanding what others are saying. You may experience confusion, slur your words or have difficulty understanding speech.\n2 Paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg. You may develop sudden numbness, weakness or paralysis in your face, arm or leg. This often affects just one side of your body. Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time. If one arm begins to fall, you may be having a stroke. Also, one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile.\n3 Problems seeing in one or both eyes. You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double.\n4 Headache. A sudden, severe headache, which may be accompanied by vomiting, dizziness or altered consciousness, may indicate that you're having a stroke.\n5 Trouble walking. You may stumble or lose your balance. You may also have sudden dizziness or a loss of coordination.\nCauses\nThere are two main causes of stroke: a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may have only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), that doesn't cause lasting symptoms.\n1 Ischemic stroke\nIschemic strokeOpen pop-up dialog box\nThis is the most common type of stroke. It happens when the brain's blood vessels become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia). Blocked or narrowed blood vessels are caused by fatty deposits that build up in blood vessels or by blood clots or other debris that travel through your bloodstream and lodge in the blood vessels in your brain.\nSome initial research shows that COVID-19 infection may be a possible cause of ischemic stroke, but more study is needed.\n2 Hemorrhagic stroke:\nHemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures. Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect your blood vessels. Factors related to hemorrhagic stroke include:\nUncontrolled high blood pressure\nOvertreatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants)\nBulges at weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms)\nTrauma (such as a car accident)\nProtein deposits in blood vessel walls that lead to weakness in the vessel wall (cerebral amyloid angiopathy)\nIschemic stroke leading to hemorrhage\nA less common cause of bleeding in the brain is the rupture of an abnormal tangle of thin-walled blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation).\nTransient Ischemic Stroke:\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) — sometimes known as a ministroke — is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those you'd have in a stroke. A TIA doesn't cause permanent damage. They're caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain, which may last as little as five minutes.Like an ischemic stroke, a TIA occurs when a clot or debris reduces or blocks blood flow to part of your nervous system.Seek emergency care even if you think you've had aTIA because your symptoms got better. It's not possible to tell if you're having a stroke or TIAbased only on your symptoms. If you've had a TIA, it means you may have a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to your brain. Having TIA increases your risk of having a full-blown stroke later."}

The study was stopped early on the grounds that there was an excess of breast cancer in the study group on combined therapy ,similarly there was a deficit in the oestrogen only group These differences were not statistically significant and the authors retracted the finding. The Drops study also showed a protective effect further studies are about to be published.\nSo double blind studies show a protective effect as does casual observation.\nhe excess stroke risk may be due to an increased propensity to thrombotic episodes on estrogen,the difference in the WHI trial may however be due to the aspirin treatment of the control group.\nHRT lowers cholesterol the failure to protect women over 60 against heart disease has been postulated as being due to arterial damage from the post menopausal lack of oestrogen .It however protects against hip fracture which biphosonates do not ,this is because oestrogens promote bone remodelling,both will protect against osteoporosis"}

{"_id": "bdd5484a", "question": "Do strokes cause people to pass out?", "answers": "Not always. The classic signs of a stroke are confusion with a sudden onset. Weakness on one side of the body, facial droop on one side of the body. Vision deficits on one side of the body. Inability to either express or understand words (expressive aphasia or receptive aphasia.) Difficulty swallowing (dysphasia). The person may or may not lose consciousness. To check if a person is having a stroke ask them to smile, if one side of the mouth droops it is a sign. Ask them to squeeze your hands. If one side is weaker or unable to squeeze, that is also a sign. Ask them to tell you their name, what day or season is it, and where they are. If they have trouble with any of those questions and it is new, it is a sign of cognitive decline. If you notice the symptoms right away they need to get to the hospital immediately because there is a short window of time when a clot busting drug can reduce the damage from a stroke.\nWhen a stroke occurs on the left side of the brain it affects the right side of the body. When it happens on the right side of the brain the left side of the body is affected. Damage to the brain can be small to catastrophic. Typically, the person may regain some of the functions over a period of months to a year. Probably after a year they will not regain that function."}

The shingles vaccine DIMINSHES the chance of a stroke.\nWhat’s the link between shingles and stroke?\nIn two recent large studies, people who developed shingles were up to 4.5 times more likely to suffer a subsequent stroke, highlighting the value of immunization against the virus that causes this disease. That’s because any viral or bacterial infection sparks inflammation, and for people with cardiovascular disease (CVD), that could cause plaque in the arteries to become inflamed and rupture, much like a volcano spewing molten lava.

{"_id": "cabfe8ed", "question": "Which area of the brain is affected to cause impaired movement after a stroke?", "answers": "Motor control resides in the frontal lobe of the brain, in the regions I’ve labeled here. (The blue line marks the boundary between the frontal lobe and parietal lobe.)\nCommands to the muscles below the head originate in the primary motor cortex, the long fold (gyrus) of tissue winding its way down from the top of the brain. Nerve pathways going from here to the muscles cross over to the opposite side of the body along the way, so a stroke on the left side of the brain can cause weakness or paralysis of the limbs on the right side of the body and vice versa.\nThe tissue immediately anterior to the primary motor cortex is called premotor cortex. This is where we think about how we’re going to move (like “walk quickly over to the door”) and the brain compiles a subconscious “plan” of muscular action. That plan, or program, is conveyed to the primary motor cortex, the executive center which then commands the muscles to perform that action. A stroke damaging the premotor cortex therefore can also result in impaired movement because one can’t decide what to tell the muscles to do, such as contracting the muscles needed to get up from a chair.\nThe control of facial, tongue, and pharyngeal muscles and some neck and shoulder muscles comes not from these centers but from the brainstem, via certain cranial nerves. These effects are usually seen on the same side of the body as where the stroke occurred. They can include signs such as sagging of part of the face, asymmetric tongue movement or strength, or difficulty swallowing.\nAs I’m sure you know, a stroke can also cause various speech impairments called aphasia, ranging from muteness or slurring to babbling incoherent speech.\nThe lower end of the primary motor cortex, on the left side of the brain in most people, is a major speech center called Broca’s area. A stroke here can cause Broca’s aphasia, characterized by slow speech, difficulty choosing one’s words, or speaking sounds that only approximate the sound of the intended word, like “tssair” for “chair.” In extreme cases, the stroke victim’s entire vocabulary may consist of only two or three words, sometimes the last words he or she was speaking when the stroke occurred. Such patients feel very frustrated with themselves, often maintain a tight-lipped reluctance to talk, and cut themselves off from social interaction.\nWernicke’s area at the rear of the parietal lobe is responsible for our ability to recognize spoken or written language (it lies at the intersection of our centers for hearing and vision), and just behind it (a triangular area of tissue that my red line to Wernicke’s area passes through) is an area, the angular gyrus, important to our ability to read and write. Wernicke’s area stores our memory of the vocabulary and grammar of languages we’ve learned. It’s here that we decide what we’re going to say, and signals are passed along tracts from here to Broca’s area directing it to execute the necessary muscular actions to say it (ranging from the diaphragm to tongue and lips). A stroke that damages the Wernicke area can cause Wernicke’s aphasia, in which a victim may babble on and on in a nonsensical “word salad,” make up nonexistent words, or may be unable to understand spoken or written words. Some people with lesions here have anomic aphasia (a- = without; nom- = names) in which they can’t think of the names of familiar things they once knew. Shown a picture of a chair, such a person might say, “Oh, I know what it is. I have a lot of them at home. I just can’t think what they’re called.” (My examples come from Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology.)\nThese aphasias are fascinating and remind us of how much we take for granted about our speech. Here are some videos of speech therapists working with patients who have various kinds of aphasia. I find the third one especially heartbreaking."}

On large and slow-turning single-cylinder engines (historical ones, or still in use in some agricultural applications), you can directly observe the dramatic changes in angular velocity of the crankshaft as it progresses through the cycle.\nIn a multi-cylinder engine, the power strokes of the other cylinders are also applying force to input energy into the crankshaft, which can make for a much smoother operation of the engine."}

Please talk to a medical professional to discuss.\nThat being said…\nNo, it has no relevance. Cool air actually helps improve sleep. When the body temp lowers, it knows it's time to rest / recharge. In fact, there are sleep aids that help lower the body temperature to help induce and maintain sleep as well as improve quality. Fresh air (from a window) also improves air quality. Newer houses are so efficient (no leaky windows, loose door, etc) that air quality has significantly decreased as well as proven increase of flu / cold, etc unless an air to air heat exchanger (heat recovery unit) has been installed to maintain efficiency and improve air quality. So the cool / cold air aids in quality sleep and improves air quality and respiratory health.\nThere has also been rumor that cold air has caused Bell's Pausy as well. To the best of my knowledge, that is an old wive's tail as well. Also considering that a proper Bell's Pausy diagnosis can be questionable and can take time, as it is only diagnosed by exclusion (no definative diagnostic test to prove it.\nI think your wife may be listening to old family beliefs, old wives tails, etc. I bet you, if you got some cool fresh air, you'd both sleep better and feel better as well.

What’s a “but for”? Stop sniggering at the back, you! You ask if the event would have happened when it did but for the supposed causative event.\nWould Brian Sicknick have died at that time but for being beaten round the head? Almost certainly not. Therefore being beaten round the head caused him to die. It doesn’t matter if he would have had a stroke the next day or if he would have lived for another fifty years with the risk of stroke. He died because he was beaten. So the people who beat him caused his death illegally. The only question is what version of homicide/manslaughter they should be charged with.\nAnd, just in case you’re think that that sounds unfair, consider this. If someone is shot, the cause of death is often going to be blood loss. Would you say the shooter shouldn’t be accused of murder in that case?\nFootnotes\n[1] The “But For” Test, Substantial Factor in Negligence Cases"}

It’s not at all clear that salt intake will affect blood pressure in otherwise healthy people. That’s because the kidneys are designed to keep the sodium level (table salt contains sodium and chloride) in the blood stable. You will just pee off any extra salt you take in.\nThe other part of your question about treating blood pressure by drinking enough tap water is now moot because the base assumption is not accurate. If one had high blood pressure, drinking a lot of water would not affect your blood pressure unless your kidneys were not working correctly. As with salt, your body will pee off extra water (unless it’s an excessively large amount of water).\nIt is true, however, that long-standing untreated high blood pressure can damage the kidneys (along with other organs); in which case salt and water intake may need to be monitored closely because the kidney is now not as efficient at maintaining proper amounts of water and elements like sodium in the body.\nEdit 2/26/2018: Liang-Hai Sie's answer to Should healthy people restrict their salt intake? is another point of view. I link to his answer because I find his answers to be well-researched and precise."}

Figuring it was simple chainmail, like the ones you forward to the next person or something bad will happen to you, he tried to disregard it, but picked it up and took it home with him anyway. When he opened it, there was a set of instructions on the inside, the first being “The person whose name is written in this note shall die.” He figured it wouldn’t work, but something about the notebook compelled him to try it anyhow. On the television at the time was a crime in progress, and, to test the notebook, he wrote down the name of the criminal on television. As fate would have it, exactly forty seconds later, the criminal fell over dead from a heart attack. So he goes along executing criminals, making them out to look like natural causes for death, until they are eventually linked to murders, and he is caught and killed himself.\nBut that’s probably not what you’re looking for in an answer.\nMoral of the story: If you figure out how to kill people through natural causes, like a stroke or heart attack, watch yourself and don’t abuse the power. Someone will find out they’re related eventually."}

Beer is a form of alcohol. Many beer drinkers also smoke, which is another risk factor for a stroke. Heavy beer drinkers often develop a “beer gut”, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes all of which may contribute to the risk of stroke.\nThat said, there are other potential causes. The neurologist who did the workup on the stroke victim/survivor is likely to know more. The type of stroke, the location of the stroke and other “artifacts” seen in the CT and MRI images all tell a story.\nAs I rode in the ambulance from the ICU to the acute care rehab hospital, the EMT asked me how many strokes I’d had. I looked at him in surprise and asked “Do people do this more than once?” The notion of having another stroke was shocking to me. He said that people can have several strokes. The greatest risk factor for stroke is having had a stroke. That was sobering news.\nIf you/he/she has already survived a stroke, address the underlying issues with great commitment. It is not necessary to have multiple strokes.\nTake blood pressure medication(s), if they are prescribed.\nStop smoking anything.\nExercise religiously, even if physical function is limited. There are always ways to get the heart rate up and keep it up for 30 minutes per day.\nReduce beer consumption to one 12 ounce 5% beer per day. Better yet, replace it with red wine. If you/he/she cannot stop after one drink, don’t drink at all, ever.\nLearn about the DASH diet\nand how to prepare and enjoy whole foods.\nThe DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet eating plan has been proven to lower blood pressure in studies sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. In addition to being a low salt (or low sodium) plan, the DASH diet reduces blood pressure. It is based on an eating plan rich in fruits and vegetables, and low-fat or nonfat dairy, with whole grains. It is a high fiber, low to moderate fat diet, rich in potassium, calcium, and magnesium — all of which help manage hypertension.\nSee your doctor regularly for follow-up appointments.\nIf he or she did not survive the stroke, you have my sympathy. But for Grace, that would have been me. After I GOT out of the hospital I was shocked to read that 30–50% of those who have a hemorrhagic stroke do not survive. My daughter told me later that the neurologist told my husband that “if she survives the night, she should be ok.” I had no clue.\nQuorans — please do all you can to avoid having a stroke yourself and encourage loved ones to do the same.

It is of course anything be funny!\nStill the arm get wierd and the person gets up relieves the pressure and it is all OK.\nNerves simply cannot take a joke; they may be injured by significantly less pressure than muscles so it is a self protection mechanism that they have direct way to express “Get me out of here” to the brain.\nIOf it resolves quickly its just life.\nPressure on nerves inside the spinal column is much harder to relieve and therefor more serious.

{"_id": "a35311b7", "question": "What are all the causes for a 49cc 4-stroke pull start engine to not start?", "answers": "Most small engines have a pump to prime the system, make sure you prime the system before attempting to start the engine. Also small engines usually have a manual choke. Make sure to follow the choke instructions as per the manufacture for starting the engine when it is cold. Small engines when cold can be difficult to start if the choke procedures are not followed to the letter.\nIf the engine still doesn’t start, then it is almost always lack of spark or a fuel system problem. You can check the spark by pulling the plug wire and holding it 3/8″ from any metal surface on the engine. When the engine is turned, the spark should jump the gap if the ignition is working. If the engine has spark, then it is probably due to not getting enough or getting too much fuel. If your not a mechanic it is probably time to take it in for service.\nMany areas have ethanol added to the gasoline at least part of the year. Many small engines are NOT designed to run with ethanol. Ethanol can dissolve some parts in particular rubber and some gaskets. This can create problems since leak can spring in the fuel system. Also, if ethanol sits for long periods of time, it will separate and sit on the bottom of the fuel tank and carburator. There is a bacteria that loves ethanol and in the process of digesting the ethanol, it produces a powerful acid that will damage most fuel systems. That acid is can literally eat through metal parts. It is advisable to drain the gas from the engine if your not planning to use it in the next couple of weeks."}

{"_id": "2fe7ecad", "question": "Does having a thicker blood cause a stroke?", "answers": "Thickness in terms of viscosity, yes. Viscosity is defined as the state of being thick, sticky, and semifluid in consistency, due to internal friction. Proteins and blood cells increase blood viscosity, and the amount of viscosity in blood is usually a good indication of high levels of plasma proteins, often a sign of inflammation present in the body or a reflection of the amount of paraproteins (monoclonal immunoglobulins or antibodies) in blood. At blood glucose level of > 90 mg/dL blood becomes highly viscous whether in diabetic patients or in normal subjects.\nThickness due to viscosity is unlike thickness due to density in that with density significant bonding is between the constituent molecules of a substance but with viscosity there is a much stronger interaction between the molecules in a substance and those of the container itself at their common interface. Density is defined as the degree of compactness of a substance.\nIt is important to differentiate the two types of thickness because they influence flow dynamics very differently. Viscosity increases resistance to blood flow, raises blood pressure and provokes turbulent flow of blood that can disrupt plaques and lead to strokes and heart attacks. But dense liquids like mercury flow with less resistance and less turbulence.\nDehydration decreases the amount of water that shields the free reactive groups in biomolecules including proteins and glucose that make them viscous and so low concentrations of these biochemical substances do not pose any significant viscosity threat as higher concentrations will do. Body cells are just a cluster of ‘sticky’ biomolecules, and an increase in the red blood or white blood cell count will raise the viscosity of blood, increase drag and blood pressure and may provoke a stroke or heart attack.\n1./ Acute hyperviscosity: syndromes and management\n2./Plasma viscosity\n.\n3./Effect of osmolality on red blood cell viscosity and transit through the lung - PubMed\n."}
{"_id": "8db14110", "question": "How can a stroke cause anger?", "answers": "How can a stroke cause anger? It doesn’t directly but indirectly does due to “cause and effect”. Different parts of the brain control different functions within the body, including how we feel. If the brain that controls emotions becomes damaged by a stroke, the result can be anything to how you think, feel, or behave. No stroke is the same in all. It has to do with the part of brain affected and how much damaged has occurred. And it is different from person to person. Strokes are a traumatic life experience to anyone. Strokes may represent a “change of life” experience as well. Some stroke “victims” can never come to terms with the change of life that a stroke can bring to a person. As no two strokes are the same, the emotions effected also aren’t the same, that is with one exception. “Depression!” Depression is the most common emotion for any stroke victim.

The danger of stroke or heart attack while defecating is real. When constipated, people often “push”, just the same as a mother does during labor. This causes a tensing of the diaphragm, known as the Valsalva maneuver. It raises blood pressure, sometimes to a dangerous level that can cause strokes or heart attacks, usually in people with conditions that weaken the heart or blood vessels.\nThe Valsalva maneuver is often used to unplug ears while flying or diving, during weightlifting and even to counteract certain conditions like tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), though it can actually cause atrial fibrillation (Afib).\nInstead of “pushing” by using the Valsalva, try exhaling slowly or panting, the way women are told to do during childbirth when it isn’t advisable to push.

It's the presence of blood vessel clogging culprits like plaque, fibrosis,traumatic injury, that allow these clots to get stuck, thus impeding blood flow. Our blood carries oxygen, and without the supply of oxygen, the affected area of any and all of the systems in our body;integumentary , cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory, etc…begin to die fairly immediately.

{"_id": "82cf3115", "question": "How does smoking cause a heart attack? Is it similar to how smoking causes a stroke?", "answers": "Coronary Heart Diseaseoccurs when arteries that carry blood to the heart muscle are narrowed by plaque or blocked by clots. Chemicals in cigarette smoke cause the blood to thicken and form clots inside veins and arteries. Blockage from a clot can lead to a heart attack and sudden death.\nBut when you breathe in cigarette smoke, the blood that is distributed to the rest of the body becomes contaminated with the smoke's chemicals. These chemicals can damage to your heart and blood vessels,1 which can lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD)—the leading cause of all deaths in the United States.\nWhen you breathe in air from the atmosphere, the lungs take in oxygen and deliver it to the heart, which pumps this oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body through the blood vessels. But when you breathe in cigarette smoke, the blood that is distributed to the rest of the body becomes contaminated with the smoke’s chemicals. These chemicals can damage to your heart and blood vessels,1\nwhich can lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD)—the leading cause of all deaths in the United States.2\nCVD is a generic term referring to multiple conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels3\n. Some of these conditions include:\ncoronary heart disease\nhypertension (high blood pressure)\nheart attack\nstroke\naneurysms\nperipheral artery disease1,2\nIn addition to permanently damaging your heart and blood vessels, cigarette smoke can also cause CVD by changing your blood chemistry1,2\nand causing plaque—a waxy substance comprised of cholesterol, scar tissue, calcium, fat, and other material3\n—to build up in the arteries, the major blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body. This plaque buildup can lead to a disease called atherosclerosis.\nWhen the chemicals in cigarette smoke cause atherosclerosis and thickened blood in the arteries, it becomes more difficult for blood cells to move through arteries and other blood vessels to get to vital organs like the heart and brain.4\nThis can create blood clots and ultimately lead to a heart attack or stroke, even death.1,2\nOther rare but serious cardiovascular conditions that can be caused by smoking include…\nPeripheral Artery Disease (and peripheral vascular disease): A condition in which the narrowing of blood vessels results in insufficient blood flow to arms, legs, hands, and feet. Smoking is the leading preventable cause of this condition, which can result in amputation.\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm: A bulge that is formed in an area of the aorta—the main artery that distributes blood through the body—that sits in the abdomen.

Heat stroke puts tremendous stress on the body which is unable to cool itself. With a higher temperature, metabolic demand climbs markedly. Thus, death by heat stroke is usually due to inability to meet metabolic demand, especially with dehydration, resulting in multisystem/multiorgan collapse. Classic heat stroke onset occurs over hours to days except if exercise induced.

They're all reporting pretty much the same things, so far, including some details of the exam and its findings. I predict that there will be some discussion of it in the media and more details as to the legal and medical aspects of this and similar cases.\nThe thing is, natural causes doesn't make the rioters and especially the men on video assaulting Officer Sicknick heroes or even innocent. They still assaulted him and sprayed him in the face with bear spray and instigated a dangerous and stressful ordeal. Hours later he collapsed and died of 2 strokes the next day. But the bear spray apparently did not directly cause his death through injury.\nThose men are very fortunate because they most likely won't be charged with murder. They're fortunate that the examiners took the time and did a very detailed examination. They're also fortunate that the officer died at the hospital and not on the spot. Because if someone dies during a felony, even of natural causes like a heart attack, the perpetrators can be charged with murder.\nDeath by natural causes doesn't always mean that the victim was destined to die at that moment, regardless of the circumstances.

{"_id": "9a3d155c", "question": "Ultimately, is the sole cause of an ischaemic stroke, a blood clot?", "answers": "Ultimately, a stroke is when part of the brain is injured due to reduced perfusion.\nAn ischemic stroke happens when a part of the brain doesn't receive the blood that it needs because of a blockage in any one of the blood vessels that allow blood flow.\nAny part of the body that doesn’t receive oxygen gets injured and begins die. This is called ischemia.\nA blockage in blood vessels usually happens when it “clogs”. The blood vessels to the brain are like pipes that carry water. Layers of mold and “gunk” can build up over many years. The same kind of build up can happen in a person’s arteries. Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood FROM the heart TO the brain. Similar to the mold or “gunk” that clogs the pipes, there is fat that clogs the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. As the blood flow slows, it eventually clots and stops any more blood from getting to the brain.\nIn some cases, arteries near the heart, chest or neck can have clots that break loose and move with the blood flow. When a clot breaks loose, it is called an embolism, and it can clog the arteries and block blood from getting to the brain.\nA hemorrhagic stroke happens when one of the blood vessels in the brain cracks open and leaks blood in the brain. This is like when blood vessels break under the skin and there is bruising. Because the brain is such a sensitive organ, bleeding in the brain is much more serious and life threatening than bleeding under our skin. When this happens, the part of the brain that doesn't receive oxygen will get injured and begin to die."}
{"_id": "9f5d74ac", "question": "What would cause a double stroke in renal failure in a 37-year-old?", "answers": "People having chronic kidney failure have a much higher risk for cardiovascular accidents, for those not on dialysis 50% will die because of a myocardial infarction (AKA heart attack), 50% because of renal failure.\nThe blood vessels in the brain are negatively affected too, thus stroke is seen more often in kidney failure patients.\nFrom Elevated risk of\nstroke\namong patients with end-stage renal disease\nWhen considered as separate outcomes, hospitalization rates for hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke were both markedly elevated for subjects treated with dialysis (ischemic, RR = 4.3 to 10.1; hemorrhagic, RR = 4.1 to 6.7).\nPatients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have markedly advanced vascular disease when compared to the general population[1-12]\n. In particular, several authors have reported more severe atherosclerotic disease of the carotid arteries among ESRD patients than in subjects with normal renal function[3, 6-8, 12]\n. This accelerated disease of the cerebral vasculature could increase the risk of ischemic stroke in these patients. Additionally, ESRD is associated with hypertension, a bleeding diathesis, and the routine administration of heparin during hemodialysis, which could increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke."}

{"_id": "8ddc2de8", "question": "Can you have a heart attack from being too high off marijuana?", "answers": "There have been a few reports of this occurring, but I’m not aware of any actually confirmed or studied cases. The last one I heard was of an 88 year old man with a long history of heart problems who consumed an entire 800 mg THC lollipop (standard dose is 5 mg) and suffered a heart attack. I believe it was his 5th one or something.\nTachycardia, or an increased heart rate, is a very frequent side effect of marijuana consumption for first-time users. This increase in heart rate is roughly equivalent to a 15 minute cardio workout. Once tolerance develops, tachycardia is one of the first side effects to go away. A consumer’s heart rate will slow down significantly after 1 hour, and returns to normal within 2 hours. Although no one has ever died from cannabis consumption, heart attacks included, patients with heart conditions should still monitor their heart rates carefully if they decide to consume marijuana.\nIt’s not something the average person needs to worry about at all. Consumers with debilitating heart conditions should consult their doctor before consuming any form of cannabis."}
{"_id": "a5d7c654", "question": "Can a stroke cause mental retardation?", "answers": "“Mental retardation” is an old term not in use anymore to describe the loss of intelligence.\nA stroke survivor doesn’t lose their intelligence. They can lose higher executive functions (in Right Hemisphere strokes) that concern decision making. Dementia is also possible (affecting memory and recall). They can lose the abilities of distinction due to lesion and inflammation damage.\nHere’s an example of one of the most catastrophic strokes that occurs in a Pontine region of the brain steam. It can cause Locked-In Syndrome.\nHe can’t move (quadriplegic).\nCan’t speak.\nCompletely dependent on another to live.\nBut otherwise his memories ; emotions (has a temper!); ambitions and intelligence all remain intact. He reads from a board, that another holds so his EYES can see it.\nHe is a living human being (even lifts weights with help!). All measures of a life people consider living.\nStrokes these days are treatable. Not everyone is going to have the same results. But must of us do live and go about our daily lives as anyone else.\nI had two PCA strokes. Half my body is weak. My vision isn’t good (visual snow). Last stroke was a Right Hemisphere stroke even. I go about my life slower moving, but still living like others. My intelligence, memory or recall wasn’t affected at all.\nI’m typing this even."}

{"_id": "392e4f99", "question": "What would cause infection in the blood to cause sepsis, fever and grogginess like a stroke?", "answers": "Last month I responded to a 70 year old female complaining of ‘palpitations’.\nShe looked and sounded unwell. I started going down the route of ECG and blood pressure given her description of palpitations, noting she was feverish, confused and had really low blood pressure.\nFortunately I was with a higher qualified paramedic who recognised septic shock quicker than I did.\nWe had her into the ambulance with Advanced Life Support on its way, hooked up two IV lines and gave large volumes of fluids plus multiple IV antibiotics. We met the ALS support en route to hospital, and they also administered IV adrenaline to help combat the shock. She was status one and only just hanging on when we went into the resus room. Incredibly, I believe she survived.\nThe cause of all of this was a Urinary Tract Infection. Sepsis and the other signs and symptoms you mention can be caused by any kind of bacterial infection. Don’t wait for it to turn into septic shock!"}

{"_id": "bcac541d", "question": "What caused Sharon Stone’s stroke in 2001?", "answers": "Sharon Stone’s stroke was caused by hemorrhaging from a ruptured vertebral artery, located at the back of her neck. According to Stone, she had no risk factors for stroke and was not engaging in behavior that could have caused it (smoking, for instance), but she was under a lot of stress at the time. Since stress can cause your heart to work harder and increase blood pressure, it is possible that this contributed to her stroke."}
{"_id": "6692e183", "question": "What poison could have been administered in the sixteenth century to cause slow death (weeks not hours) with stroke-like symptoms?", "answers": "Interesting question and not an easy one. Most poisons will have gastrointestinal symptoms and typically would cause the first symptoms in hours. If you can let the stroke like symptoms try the Cortinarius orellanus mushroom. This will destroy the kidneys and will cause natural looking death after a couple of weeks. Another good tip is dimethil mercury. That will cause death after several weeks with neurological symptoms that can easily mistaken with stroke in the 16 century. However there is no way that you can handle the material in the 16th century in a safe way. So you will also die but if this not an issue go for it."}

{"_id": "ebcedbcd", "question": "Can eating too much pizza cause a stroke?", "answers": "All diet related stroke damage is going to be cumulative over years, and relates to inflamation.\nUnfair to blame poor old pizza. All bread items equally add carbs, and as such are connected to heart disease. that however is not strokes. There is evidence to suggest that glycated ApoB protein is involved, and bread supplies tons of glucose to the blood.\nSo you maybe have a link with grains and leaky gut causing inflamation, or with an imballance of omega 6 over omega 3 promoting more inflamatory end products, so maybe link more to which seed oil you use, not to the olive oil with pizzas."}

A large income drop in itself is a massively stressful situation that some physicians believe can cause a myocardial or cerebral event just from the sheer stress.\nLooking past that, having low income, as a stereotype, makes people think of living on a poor diet such as mcdonalds meals or eating food from tins instead of fruit and vegetables and a balanced home cooked meal due to lack of affordability. People also peg low income households as less likely to go out and socialise which can impact mental health or exercise regularly and use gyms which impacts physiological health.\nAll these factors can affect the likelihood of developing heart disease, diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, atherosclerosis etc. Live healthy, live well, dont let your diet and your happiness be your lowest expense."}

An abnormal VNG points to a vestibular dysfunction. What do you mean by dizziness? Vestibular problems causes vertigo, but not lightheadedness. Breathlessness doesn’t come into play at all.\nUnless he was chronically hyperventilating, subjectively feeling breathless and inappropriately breathing too deeply too fast, don’t know it this can be the result of his mini stroke, his neurologist should look into this, hyperventilation is easily diagnosed by having his blood gasses done. Hyperventilation also causes dizziness, and often a prickly feeling in hands and feet and around the mouth. We often see it in anxious nervous panicky people, often as a symptoms a panic attacks.\nHaving had vestibular neuronitis myself, I know what vertigo is, the world whirling around you making you sick, and puke, definitively NOT dizzy.\nAll the best!"}

Ive seen it happen more then once and it just generally causes the vehicle to smoke more then normal when running. Whats more likely is when you ran it dry you may of burned up the fuel pump ( it uses fuel as a lubricant / coolant and running it dry can kill / damage them ) or you sucked up a bunch of sediment that naturally builds up at the bottom of the tank and your filter sock on the fuel pump is clogged."}
{"_id": "8f98969e", "question": "Can anxiety cause a stroke?", "answers": "Anxiety or stress plays a very important role in your cardiovascular health.\nIf you are in a down mood, your body is subdued and liable for diseases to “sink” in. Anxiety often leads to anger or dissatisfaction, or conflict in your life, and all these could directly get your blood pressure high, and the impact will be felt in the arteries in brain too.\nIf stimulus is severe, and your arteries were already in an unhealthy condition - negative lifestyle lead to blood plaque buildups or early aging of arteries, you will significantly increase your chance of getting cardiovascular problems like stroke.\nIf you want to nip it in the bud, you should remember the three pillar of good health: a good mood and peaceful mind, regular reasonable exercise and healthy dieting habit."}
