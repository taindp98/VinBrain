{"_id": "913ff7bc", "question": "How can I prevent myself from having a stroke?", "answers": "Currently, we have no Heimlich maneuver for CVA, other than a substance called TPA, which is injected into the bloodstream and causes any clots to break apart, thus opening any blocked vesicles in the brain. BUT— and it’s a big but—\nCVAs can be caused by clots (ischemic), yessireee, but they can also be caused by bleeds (hemorrhagic). If you have a bleed in your brain causing symptoms of stroke, and you just happen to have some TPA laying around, and you just happen to still be capable of injecting said TPA into your vein to break up a clot you think you have, do you know what happens? The bleed in your brain bleeds faster, and you could bleed out, because TPA works on clots, not bleeds.\nSo, you’re having stroke symptoms- sided weakness, some pins-and-needles, confusion- is it being caused by a clot or a bleed? Quickly now- guess correctly and quickly, you want to stop this immediately, remember?\nBzzzzzzt! Time’s up and guess what, you can’t know without a CT scan. What? You don’t have a CT scanner at your house? Well now what?! How are you going to stop this immediately without a CT scanner?\nYou are going to call 911 or whatever your emergency services number is, and let trained, qualified medical professionals do their job and get your clogged or bleeding brain to a hospital as fast as they can. Time is brain functioning in a stroke; we have stretched the golden hour to the golden three hours, but less than one hour is still best.\nYou will be immediately evaluated while in the ambulance and wheeled directly to radiology for that CT scan. The scan will be read by a neurologist who will determine if there is a bleed- no bleed, you’ll be offered TPA. You say yes, the nurse adds a small bag of clear fluid to your IV. Within minutes, you start to feel less confused, not so groggy. Every minute after that, you ‘clear’ a bit more. You may come all the way back in a matter of hours, there may always be some residual damage, you won’t know until you are on your individual journey.\nIf the scan showed a bleed, you will be whisked into surgery and the bleed will be stopped if possible- if accessible. Sometimes a transfusion of clotting factors can be given if the bleed cannot be reached. Then, of course, care must be taken there’s not a clot in the brain, too. You may come all the way back in a matter of hours, there may always be some residual damage, you won’t know until you are on your individual journey.\nBut, that is the best we have right now, and it is far and away better than what we had even a quarter century ago. Thank your lucky stars."}

{"_id": "b5b84df0", "question": "When is warfarin used to prevent strokes?", "answers": "Warfarin is mainly used for prevention of stroke when a person has atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation means the atrium (upper chamber of the heart) beats irregularly which causes blood stasis and increases the chance of blood clot formation. When the blood clot travels to the brain circulation this can cause an embolic stroke.\nHowever not everyone with atrial fibrillation requires warfarin prophylaxis. The indication will depend on a score known as the CHADSVASC score. When the score is more than Or equals to two, anticoagulant such as warfarin should be given.\nPleas note that nowadays the use of NOAC is getting more popular and it has largely replaced warfarin in the prevention of embolic stroke in AF patient. However in the case of mechanical heart valve and AF due to valvular heart disease such as mitral stenosis, warfarin is superior to NOAC in the prevention of embolic stroke thus it’s use in such patients remain irreplaceable."}

For this we get good verified information from him.\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….\nHealthy eating can reduce the risk of stroke\nResearchers at Oxford University have investigated the influence of dietary habits on the risk of stroke. The large-scale study shows the importance of healthy eating, but also provides some surprises.\nThere are two types of stroke. One is ischaemic stroke or brain attack, in which a blood clot cuts off the blood supply to the brain. The other type is the hemorrhagic stroke, also called a brain haemorrhage. This is much less common and therefore less well researched.\n\"Most early studies look at either the general risk of stroke or stroke. This is partly because cerebral haemorrhages are rather rare in Europe. Many other studies simply don't have the necessary numbers of participants.\" Tammy Tong, University of Oxford\nThe study, which Tammy Tong and her colleagues have now published, has the necessary number of participants. Almost 420,000 people from nine European countries accompanied the physicians for an average of more than twelve years. Such large groups need nutritional physicians to answer the question: What influence does nutrition have on diseases? The new study confirms what research on brain infarction has already shown: People who eat fruit, vegetables and fibre have a lower risk of stroke. Fruits and vegetables contain, among other things, potassium and magnesium, which have a blood pressure-lowering effect.\nRed meat is better with high-fibre side dishes\nIn contrast, another foodstuff is probably not as harmful as assumed, namely red meat, for example from pork, beef or lamb.\nThe researchers initially found that eating red meat increases the risk of ischaemic stroke. However, this disappeared again when they offset the consumption of fibre and other healthy foods. People who eat a lot of meat probably consume less fibre and therefore have an increased risk. With plenty of fibre-rich vegetables on the side, there is nothing wrong with a steak now and then - at least as far as the risk of stroke is concerned.\nEggs - a mysterious risk factor for cerebral haemorrhage\nIn the second type of stroke, cerebral haemorrhage, however, the diet with dietary fibres, fruit and vegetables showed no effect. Instead, the researchers found another \"risk food\", namely eggs.\nThe risk already increases with one third of eggs per day. But according to Tammy Tong, this is initially only a statistical correlation. Cause and effect can only be clarified with further research. Regardless of this, there is already a lot of evidence that fibre, fruit and vegetables are good for your health - not only to prevent a stroke.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"What is good now and would be protective against stroke, is just as beneficial probably against heart attack, against diabetes, and certainly also against cancer. We are increasingly trying to find a healthy diet that keeps people healthy and fit for a long time and protects them from these modern diseases.

When I want a dependable answer about meds of any kind, I research, and check with the med specialists. Two or more experienced pharmacists. In this matter, one or 2 cardiologists. A baby aspirin daily is reputed to alleviate strokes but that would only be due to the thinning of the blood to reduce clots and/or possible calcification in the blood vessels. However, remember when we first learned too many eggs caused higher cholesterol and then that was disputed? Next it will be determined that it is bad again, then good again? I’m convinced medicine is still very much an art and not strictly a science on a daily basis. If you are a potential stroke patient, if your stomach can handle it, a baby aspirin a day could be a good choice for you.

Not all strokes hit the language centres, not all that do happen with bilinguals, and not all that happen with bilinguals affect one language but not the rest.\nYou may also have heard that people who are bilingual who get dementia get the overt symptoms of it several years later than the average monolingual person. But that is a different case, and the rate of lesions in the brain after death is actually the same, if I remember the facts correctly; e.g. two people both die at age 85 and have the same rate of lesions in the brain, but the monolingual had started showing symptoms at 75 while the bilingual had started showing symptoms at 80.

{"_id": "9e4c377a", "question": "Can ketamine prevent brain damage due to stroke?", "answers": "The is some evidence that ketamine can be neuroprotective, yes, but it isn’t widely used for this for reasons that should be obvious (dissociative, neurotoxic…) Stroke management is tricky because it’s all in the timing – typically a patient loses 1.9 million neurons for every minute the stroke goes untreated (1) and the standard intervention is to restore blood flow as quickly as possible (thrombolysis or thrombectomy). The use of neuroprotective drugs for stroke is a relatively new idea. These drugs prevent apoptosis of neurons by inhibiting the neurotransmitters that send the signal for controlled cell death. They essentially prevent neurons from communicating with each other, thus preventing the signals for apoptosis. Ketamine is purported to have this action too, but the evidence is limited and the adverse effects may outweigh the therapeutic ones.\nKetamine’s neuroprotective method of action is that it stops speading depolarisation. Spreading depolarisation is a normal phenomenon of cellular communication that becomes damaging after an ischemic attack. For instance, an ischemic lesion caused by lack of blood supply to an area of the brain can become larger as spontaneous depolarisations will circle around these lesions, enlarging them with each cycle (3). There is evidence that these damaging depolarisations can be prevented by NMDA receptor antagonists (of which ketamine is one). These are a class of anaesthetics which inhibit NMDA receptors, which when over stimulated can damage cells, so, when antagonised by an an anaesthetic such as ketamine, the excitotoxic effect is reduced. The NMDA receptors will be already stimulated from the initial infarction, and without rapid intervention will initiate damaging depolarisation (and oxygen radicals and pro-apoptotic signals) . Essentially, the mechanism of the NMDA receptor antagonist is to prevent further collateral damage.\nWhether ketamine is effective at this is not yet well established, though there is already a patent (4) for ketamine as a stroke treatment. It also mentions co-administration of benzodiazepine, which may be to redude the potential adverse effects of ketamine– it exists in a racemic mixure of R- and S- optical isomers, the R- form has the anaesthetic effect and the S- has the tachychardic, psychoactive and other adverse effects . Benzodiazapines are often administered in combination to redude the adverse effects of the S- form\nSo in summary, yes, but it certainly isn’t first line treatment.

Decreasing stroke risk\nExperiencing AF and undergoing treatments for AF may put you at risk for developing blood clots in your heart. If these blood clots become dislodged from the heart, and pumped into the blood vessels in the brain, you may suffer with a stroke. Your risk of stroke is determined by risk factors such as:\nCongestive Heart Failure\nHypertension\nAge (>65yo)\nDiabetes\nStroke, or previous transient ischaemic attack (TIA or mini-strokes which fully resolve)\nVascular Disease (such as previous heart attack, peripheral vascular disease)\nSex (Female above 65yo)\nThese risk factors may be summarized as the CHA2DS2VASc, and your doctors will ask you all these questions above when assessing whether you should be started on anti-coagulant drugs.\nPreventing blood clots by using anticoagulants\nYour doctor may prescribe anticoagulants or blood-thinning medications. They are:\nWarfarin\n(Coumadin) is the oldest drug to avoid blood clots. Regular blood monitoring to check levels (INR – International Normalised Ratio) is advised to keep the levels well-controlled.\nApixaban (Eliquis), Dabigatran (Pradaxa), Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and Edoxaban (Lixiana) are termed Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC) and are agents which have been introduced to replace warfarin as good alternatives. The immediate advantage of these are that they can be prescribed without the need for continuous lifelong monitoring, although they have similar effectiveness, and bleeding risks as warfarin. This means that your doctors may offer you these agents as a useful alternative to warfarin.\nB.

{"_id": "188c11b2", "question": "How should a person living with hypertension prevent getting a stroke?", "answers": "Take your medication as prescribed, report its effectiveness to your doctor or nurse, discuss an exercise program with your doctor, get plenty of rest, eat a healthy diet and invest in a stethescope and sphygmomanometer or other blood pressure monitoring device and check your blood pressure regularly, perhaps several times daily to start, then daily. Report any consistent elevations, or low blood pressure to your physician.\nThis is NOT something you want to ignore (especially when it can be treated). If you’re struggling with blood pressure take a look at this: Blood Pressure Exercises VSL cb\nI think this video answers your question. I’m a pretty visual learner though.\nTranscript:\nHey guys, Dr. Axe here, founder of Dr. Axe. com and Doctor of Functional Medicine. Today I’m going to be sharing with you my top foods and supplements for overcoming high blood pressure. Believe it or not, blood pressure is something that can be easily balanced out if you follow the steps here that I’m going to talk about in this video. First, let’s talk about what causes high blood pressure. Most of the time when you’re reading online or in the media today, you’re going to see things like excess sodium consumption, emotional stress, poor diet, and lack of exercise. Those are four of the big ones that people say may be causing high blood pressure.\nLet’s start off talking about diet. What is the best diet for blood pressure? There are three specific nutrients you want to make sure that you’re getting in your diet if you have high blood pressure. Those include potassium, antioxidants, as well as omega 3 fatty acids. In fact, if I had to throw a fourth one in there I would say magnesium.\nIf you can add those four nutrients into your diet and eat foods that are high in those substances, you’re going to see your blood pressure really balance out there very quickly. That’s going to be a diet that’s high in fruits, vegetables, sprouted nuts and seeds, and organic, wild caught meats. One of the things you may do after watching this video is go to my site, Dr. Axe. com, do a search for potassium rich foods, magnesium rich foods, and omega 3 rich foods. If you go and look at those food lists, you’ll see things like avocados are packed with magnesium and potassium. Doing guacamole would be great for you or consuming chia seeds or wild caught salmon or other foods like that. Figs are super high in potassium as well. Again, I would go online and look up foods that are really high in potassium, magnesium, omega 3 fatty acids, and antioxidants as well. We have actually all of those top ten lists there on Dr. Axe. com.\nThat should be diet. Some things you want to avoid, diet wise, when you’re following a healthy blood pressure diet is avoid excess sodium intake. You don’t want to overdo the salt. A little bit of sea salt is fine, but definitely stay away from the processed iodized salt. Really eliminating processed sugar.\nProcessed sugar will definitely cause your blood pressure to spike. Then, of course, processed and fast foods that contain hydrogenated oils, we know those are inflammatory to the body. That inflammation in the arteries will cause blood pressure to rise and actually will cause high cholesterol as well. Again, you get those foods out, add in those mineral and vitamin rich foods, and you’re going to see immediate results in your blood pressure. Then in terms of the best supplements to naturally treat blood pressure, I want to go over the top ones here. The first one would be fish oil. Fish oil is high in omega 3 fatty acids. Those omega 3 fatty acids, called EPA and DHA, are highly anti inflammatory.\nWe know that high blood pressure is in part caused by inflammation. If you can start adding in wild caught fish into your diet and taking a good quality fish oil supplement at about 1000 milligrams a day, you will see results very quickly in your blood pressure. The second most important supplement to take for blood pressure is magnesium. Magnesium helps relax your blood vessel walls and improves circulation and reduces stress in your body.\nAll of those things are benefits of taking magnesium which will naturally lower blood pressure. Typically, you want to take 250 milligrams of magnesium 2 times a day. I recommend a magnesium chelate supplement when you take that. The third supplement you may want to consider taking if you have high blood pressure is Coenzyme Q10. This is absolutely essential as well if you’ve ever taken a cholesterol lowering medication. Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant that supports heart health and circulation. It also acts as an antioxidant. Again, Coenzyme Q10, about 200 milligrams a day is a great supplement for helping blood pressure issues.\nThe fourth supplement would be garlic. You can actually eat garlic or take garlic extract. Garlic contains allicin as well as other phyotnutrients that kill off bad bacteria in your body and act as antioxidants to help lower blood pressure. You can also use lavender essential oil. Lavender oil has been shown to reduce stress which is one of the major causes of high blood pressure. Typically take about two to four drops of lavender oil, rub it on your neck, and you will see that start to improve your overall blood pressure as well.\nLast but not least in lowering blood pressure, I would recommend daily exercise. You don’t have to exercise every day, but just 20 to 30 minutes 3 times a week of exercise can make a huge difference. I recommend checking out interval training like my Burst. Fit program as one of the best ways to get fit fast. Also, just in general, any form of exercise, whether it be weight training, walking, Pilates, barre classes, or even group classes, all of those are effective forms of exercise that help naturally lower your blood pressure. Hey guys, I hope you’ve enjoyed these top tips to naturally lower blood pressure. If you want to learn more, hey you can check out Dr. Axe. com. Simply search high blood pressure.\nI’ve got more articles and tips on there as well. Hey guys, this has been Dr. Axe with my top healthy blood pressure tips…"}
{"_id": "3cb273a1", "question": "Do you think aspirin can prevent a first heart attack or stroke?", "answers": "Tricky question——-\nWhat kind of stroke? 80% are ischemic/embolic. ASA can reduce that risk. But it increases the risk of hemorrhagic strokes (the other 20%), and makes them worse when they occur.\nIn trials involving large numbers of people with normal risks of strokes/heart attacks (the general population), and followed for many years, and then compared to an equal group who did not take ASA—there was a small decrease in ischemic strokes & heart attacks. But there was an increase in hemorrhagic strokes + hemorrhagic events such as GI bleeds.\nThe ‘experts’ decided that routinely taking daily ASA was not overall beneficial… One reason is that most of those people don’t have anything ASA helps but they all have the risks of the complications.\nBut, you say, what about people at increased risks of strokes/heart attacks. Well, the biggest group of people in that category are those who have already had at least one stroke or heart attack—and those people are excluded from your question.\nThere are some people who for some reason are found to have significant carotid stenoses and/or coronary artery blockages during a routine physical exam. But that is unusual. Those things don’t just leap out at you when you see a patient routinely. (There is no highly accurate/easy/cheap/safe screening test, so we don’t do them unless there is a good reason). And those people don’t fit into the clinical trials mentioned above). If we do find somebody who does have significant carotid/coronary disease, and before they have an event, we do use ASA. But we also use statins, B-blockers, regulated exercise, etc. So again they don’t fit with your basic question.\nIn summary, routine preventative use of ASA has been found to not be wise. But ASA used in a more focused fashion is."}

{"_id": "1f73555e", "question": "What are some signs of a coming stroke, and what do you do to prevent it?", "answers": "I dont know about others, but I had a sign weeks before my stroke. I felt as if my eyes were crossing. I could feel the sensation and run to a mirror, no signs of crossing. I don't even know HOW to cross my eyes! I told my OB doctor but he just blamed it on my eye vessels enlarging due to my pregnancy. Since then I've been told it was a textbook case for clots entering the back part of my brain.\nSome people have TIA’s which are HUGE warnings of an impeding stroke. People have stroke like symptoms. Like speech being garbled, eye or mouth muscles drooping.\nAs far as preventing a stroke. Since there are 2 kinds of stroke, ischemic(clot) or hemorrhagic ( bleeding in your brain) I'm really not qualified to tell you how to prevent them since I had one! My mother died from a hemorrhagic stroke! Her symptoms were a BAD headache with nausea/vomiting. She did have TIA’s where she was incoherent, confused, but my mom was not one to visit doctors! She paid the ultimate price for not seeing her Doctor. So I'd recommend if you have worries, please seek help from your physician!"}
{"_id": "9d724c09", "question": "Is there any lifestyle (including food) you could have changed to help prevent your stroke? What stroke prevention advice can you offer us seniors?", "answers": "Whole-food plant-based diet without refined or processed food, and very little or no oil not only prevents cardiovascular diseases but it can also reverse it. The plant-based diet should not include any animal protein including dairy and eggs. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Director of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Reversal Program at the Cleveland Clinic has actually reversed arterial plaque buildup in his patients by changing the diet, as shown in the angiographic evidence below. Image A is shows the original plaque buildup and image B is after being on a whole-food plant-based diet for 32 months\nSuch a reversal is unbelievable to most doctors who believe that once you get the disease, only option is to keep taking pills (to manage it), or if the blockage gets severe, the only option is surgery, for example bypass surgery in case of coronary arteries.\nYou may want to look at my answer to a similar question on Quora for more information here. Ramesh Kakkad's answer to Will atherosclerosis go away if you change your diet?"}
{"_id": "9f0d873c", "question": "How do prevent heart stroke with diet and lifestyle change?", "answers": "What You Can Do to Prevent a Heart Attack\nYou want what’s best for your heart. And it’s simpler than you might think. These lifestyle changes can help prevent a heart attack and heart disease.\nEat to be your best. Add plenty of fruits and veggies, grains, and foods high in omega-3 fatty acids like fresh tuna or herring to your diet. Cut down on salt, saturated fats, sweets, and red meats. Avoid trans fats and food with “hydrogenated” or “partially hydrogenated” ingredients. Variety in your diet is a good way to get all the nutrients you need.\nTake it easy. Find a relaxation method that works for you. Yoga, meditation, dedicated time to unwind after work -- these can help keep your stress levels down. Stressful emotions such as anger and hostility may also lead to heart attack risk, so keep calm and be cool.\nBan smoking. If you never started smoking, that’s perfect! If you already quit, excellent. If you still smoke, stop. Talk to your doctor to find out what method will work best for you. Even people who smoke fewer than five cigarettes a day can have early signs of heart disease. Start now. In just 1 year you can reduce your risk of a heart attack."}

{"_id": "77c59e5b", "question": "How should I prevent a heart stroke while exercising in the morning?", "answers": "I assume you mean heat stroke?\nIf you are otherwise healthy, cleared for exercise, and have no medical conditions then heat stroke (a medical emergency) is uncommon. Heat exhaustion is what many people experience.\nThis is a combination of hot outdoor temperatures, body overheating and dehydration. Execising in shaded areas as much as possible, taking breaks or doing intervals of intensity can help balance things out, and hydrating as much as possible. Being mindful of the outdoor weather and exercising caution as temperatures rise toward the 90s and 100s is good practice. Humid climates also do not allow you to cool down as easy because of how we get rid of heat through sweat. If you find yourself overheating then stop and do not push yourself.\nIf you do mean a heart attack or stroke, then a combination of a healthy lifestyle, weight loss, and medication if needed or advised by your doctor. Preventing heart and/or stroke AFTER this has happened is a big topic and is best discussed with your doctor or specialist since it is individualized for every person in addition to having the standard medications."}
{"_id": "b835dd55", "question": "What are things one can do to prevent blood pressure and stroke?", "answers": "There are several things that one could do in order to PREVENT them from getting HYPERTENSION (High Blood Pressure) or a STROKE.\nThe most important thing to keep in mind is to have a healthy lifestyle, which we all forget due to our busy schedules. Well, you must be thinking that this is so basic and nothing new….\nDo keep in mind that nowadays people don't stick to the basics.. The basics of maintaining healthy and good lifestyle habits.\nDo regular physical activities at least 3–4 times a week which includes some form of cardio workouts. Having a sedentary lifestyle is one of the main cause of people developing these conditions.\n2. If you are a smoker, make sure that you somehow manage to quit smoking as it can lead to both hypertension and stroke. There are many more risk factors due to smoking as mentioned in the diagram below…\n3. Have a well balanced diet that includes Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats in proper amounts. People who consume high salt containing diets (eg:-fast foods) regularly can have a high chance of getting Hypertension.\nIts not that you cannot consume fast foods but it could lead to many diseases when consumed in high amounts.\nSo please keep that in mind.. Having a cheat meal once a week will not do much harm specially if you are an active person with good lifestyle habits.\n4. Sleep deprivation is also know to cause hypertension. So make sure you get enough sleep which may vary from person to person (5 hours to 7 hours). When people are sleep deprived their body cannot regulate stress hormones. When these hormones circulate your body for a long time, this in turn can lead to hypertension.\n5. If you have palpitations on and off throughout your day without any reason/while at rest/while you sleep or in simple words if you feel like your heart is beating faster more than normal, then please do a check up with your doctor. There is a condition known as ”ATRIAL FIBRILLATION” where your heart beats faster with an irregular rhythm which could eventually lead to the formation of a blood clot that might travel to your brain through the artery and block the artery that supplies blood to your brain leading to a STROKE.\nThere are many factors that i haven't mentioned here and i have tried to keep it simple as possible. Well these are the few basics that can actually prevent you from getting hypertension or a stroke in the future. Remember that doing these simple things do matter in the long run..\nWell if you are diagnosed with hypertension even the doctor wont immediately prescribe you with medications. Initially the doctor would ask about your lifestyle and advice you to do some modifications and check up with you in months time before starting up with drugs.\nHope you’ll got a general idea about these conditions…"}

What should be the correct dose of aspirin to prevent brain strokes in middle-aged females?", "answers": "There is a difference betweeen hemorrhagic\nstrokes and ischemic\nstrokes. Ischemic means that a clot (embolus) has cut off the blood supply to a portion of your brain. Since aspirin reduces platelet aggregation, it reduces your likelihood of ischemic stroke.\nHemorrhagic stoke is caused by aspirin.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all correct dose: Among other factors, it depends on your LDL over HDL ratio, exercise levels, and degree of atherosclerosis; a matter for your doctor to decide, especially following any evidence of stroke."}
{"_id": "58897c6a", "question": "What can I do to prevent a heart attack or stroke?", "answers": "The usual recommendations—avoid tobacco and diabetes, maintain healthy blood pressure and regular exercise—are applicable to everyone and are intended to reduce long-term risk from chronic conditions like atherosclerosis, which often starts in childhood but doesn’t reach the degree of damage necessary to cause a true myocardial infarction (heart attack) until many years later.\nA true myocardial infarction in a person in his or her mid-20s is very unusual and suggests either severe premature atherosclerosis (due to very poorly-controlled Type I diabetes or familial hyperlipidemia, for example) or provocation such as ephedrine or cocaine, although coronary vasospasm (cramping of the artery causing temporary blockage of flow) has been found to be a rare cause as well. Spontaneous ventricular dysrhythmias, often the result of abnormal thickness of the cardiac septum (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) can cause collapse and sudden death, and are sometimes referred to as a “heart attack,” but are fortunately rare, especially in women."}
{"_id": "f6b39454", "question": "Which is the best aspirin in India for heart attack and stroke prevention: Disprin (350 mg), Colsprin (100 mg) or Ecosprin (75 mg)? What is the best time to take such tablets, early morning or late night?", "answers": "The choice goes undoubtedly to ecosprin 75 mg, as you have asked for preventive care. But using it for lifetime was taught to old school MBBS, and this concept is rather changing now a days. Younger medical graduates dont prefer its long usage and research in this respect is debatable. But in case you are interested in a much older remedy for the same, the combination of 2 brothers-terminalia arjuna and terminalia chebula would go a very long way. Reserch shows them to be multiple organ protective along with balancing the cholestrol deposition. While arjuna bark is taken as a herbal tea in morning(I am fond of it as it has a very mild fragrance), the chebula is a small dried, fruit which can be chewed any time of the day.Continued use of both of these will make your heart as strong as that of a young one.

{"_id": "c590411b", "question": "Is taking aspirin to prevent a stroke a probable risk for a brain hemorrhage?", "answers": "First of all, it matters how much aspirin you are talking about, and how often. It’s typically used to thin the blood for the heart. When patients would tell me this, they would say the doctor told me to take and aspirin a day, or a half of an aspirin per day (which breaks the enteric coating and causes stomach issues). Many times, the patients wouldn’t put it on their meds list, because it’s “just” aspirin, I’d look into their eye, and ask if they were taking aspirin. They would ask how I knew; they would have “micro aneurysms”, little microscopic bleeding in the eye.\nA standard Aspirin is 325 mg, too much for daily consumption, as is a half 162mg; half of a half aspirin has been the most common dosage for daily use, that’s 81mg, sold as a chewable baby aspirin (my choice) or as the brand Ecotrin.\nAs for strokes, as you get older, a doctor can turn the end of a stethoscope around to the “Bell” potion and listen to your carotid arteries in your neck, listing for what’s called “Bruit” (brewey), a swooshing sound in your neck, sometimes only in one of the 2 carotids on either side. In the eye, I can see “Holenhorst Plaques”, flat flakes that break off of the cholesterol in your carotids. When I look in, they look like someone is back in your retina with a bright yellow flashlight shining back at me, if the flat side is facing me. If on edge they are harder to see, these can be easily missed. Sometimes, I can press on the eye, and make them flash on and off. It is not a good sign. I send the patients out for an Echo, ultrasound of the carotids.\nI tell the patients that they may have an impending stroke to make sure they get in, timely. I had one patient actually have a stroke, while they were doing the procedure. They hit her with some “clot buster” medications and was fine. She was very grateful at her next visit, when she told me the story. I would say ¾ th’s of patients I sent out, ended up having a procedure to remove the clots from their carotid arteries."}
{"_id": "dcf7daf3", "question": "Guitar: How can I prevent hitting the next string when performing a free stroke?", "answers": "You may not be in correct position with your right hand. Fingers pointing down, thumb out from your palm. Curve fingers towards palm. Second joint of finger should be over the string so your fingers are “snapping” back into your palm. In fact, exaggerate that movement to actually hit your palm. Exactly as stated before (and I studied with the Romeros, even their father) the first joint of your fingers should be completely relaxed and actually bend back when you make the free stroke. Keep your hand steady and DO NOT bounce it up and down. If you move to another string, the hand moves proportionately.\nMy suggestion, as always, is to learn correctly. Find a teacher or local community school and pay for lessons."}
{"_id": "4901beb7", "question": "What are some life style changes to prevent a stroke and heart attack?", "answers": "1- Don’t smoke! Fortunately smoking has been on a decline for years, but there are still far too many people who smoke. This is the number one preventible contributor to strokes and heart attacks\n2- Eat a healthy, veggie based diet low in sugar and simple carbohydrates, and full of healthy monounsaturated fats. The PRIDMED study showed that the Meditteranean diet full of nuts and olive oil reduced the risk of heart attacks and strokes\n3- Exercise. At least 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise. But also move you body. Even when you are not exercising, stay active. Take the stairs not the elevator. Park far from where you are going so you have to walk more. Don't sit more than 30minutes at a time\n4- Get adequate sleep and manage your stress levels. Cortisol and other stress hormones increase with poorly managed stress and lack of sleep and can contributed to increase risk of heart attacks and strokes\n5- Monitor your blood pressure and work with your lifestyle to maintain a healthy weight and healthy blood pressure\n6- Pick your grand parents well. This one we can’t control. Our genetics cannot be changed (yet). But knowing your family risk can sometimes serve as extra motivation to be more vigilant on the above points."}

{"_id": "1492c0e1", "question": "Would taking blood thinners every so often, after a certain age, be a good preventative method of preventing blood clots, and thereby a preventative measure for a heart attack and stroke; even if one has never suffered a stroke or heart attack?", "answers": "There are two types of blood thinners: Those that affect the platelets aggregation (e.g. aspirin) and those that effect the other clotting mechanisms (classically warfarin). They prevent different types of clots and have different effects depending on what you are treating. Coronary artery disease and strokes are treated with anti-platelet drugs (to prevent micro-aggregates in the vessels) and clots in the veins and larger vessels are prevented with drugs like warfarin, Eliquis, etc.. Taking aspirin daily (81 mg) daily has been shown to lower the risk of MI and stroke but not the other type of medication."}

{"_id": "aae4acee", "question": "Which is overall better for stroke prevention, Warfarin or Plavix?", "answers": "Warfarin is, overall, a much stronger blood thinner. (Well, technically, Plavix isn’t a blood thinner. Instead, it works by making it more difficult for the platelets to clot. You know what I mean, though.)\nBut there are disadvantages to Warfarin as well. For one thing, it is sensitive to what you eat. If you eat a leafy green salad one week and you don’t the next week you’re going to have problems =( You have to get tested every month to make sure you’re taking the right dose, which changes based on your age and your diet. Finally, you bleed constantly while you’re on it. Case in point: I decided to go tubing down the river next to my house right before going to Hawaii for a much-needed vacation. But I didn’t blow up the inner tube enough so my butt bumped down the rocks at the bottom of my river. I was so black and blue that I was afraid my husband might get interrogated at the airport =(\nPlavix doesn’t have any of those problems. I mean, sometimes I get bruises that I don’t know the origin of, but that’s the extent of my problems.\nAdditionally, I’ve been told that for my particular ‘brand’ of stroke (ischemic, from a clot that formed in my heart, we think), Plavix may indeed protect me better than Warfarin."}

You can buy this additive at most paint stores - labels will sometimes say it is for increasing flow when used in a paint sprayer, however I find it most effective when cutting in. Thinning your cut in paint with this will not affect the color of the paint(unless you put way too much in) and you will have more control of the paint which will dry slower and self-level better so that brush marks won’t show so much.\nAnother tip is to lower the air temperature and increase humidity where you are painting if possible. (Not too cold or humid or you may have issues with paint runs if you apply the paint too thickly) Just turn on the air conditioning, and minimize air movement, ie. overhead fans so your paint doesn’t get too dried up in your cut pail. Painting in a warmer and drier environment will make the paint “rope”(a term used by pro painters) and it will become thick with less viscosity and much more difficult to prevent these brush marks. Of course sometimes you cannot prevent dry/warm painting environments. Many of the construction sites me and my crews work on are like this - so as mentioned above, we always keep a flow additive on hand to help keep the paint flowing better. This also increases efficiency since tacky paint slows down the cut in process.\nFinal tip is to consider using the newer waterborne - alkyd paints - these are designed often to mimic old oil based coatings. In most residential applications you would not use it on walls, however it is suitable for trim, doors, and cabinets. It takes a little more care to paint with to avoid drips, however it tends to self-level well and will help you avoid ugly brush marks in the paint and leave a smooth looking finish. (not to mention it is more durable when fully cured)"}
{"_id": "e20383bf", "question": "How do people in their 50s+ prevent heart attacks and/or stroke and increase longevity?", "answers": "If a 50+ person does not yet have high blood pressure they are already at reasonably low risk for heart attack and stroke and an ongoing low stress healthy lifestyle and diet should maintain that low risk prognosis. However, a daily supplement of magnesium-L-threonate and vitamins D, B6, B12 and folic acid might also be beneficial.\nThe level of plasma total homocysteine in the blood is a biomarker for increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Maintaining a fasting level of less than 10 micromoles per liter for that biomarker would be the objective for achieving longevity and minimizing the risk of heart attack and stroke."}

{"_id": "244bcc17", "question": "Can I help prevent a stroke if I invert my body 5 minutes a day to increase blood flow to my brain?", "answers": "No, inverting your body increases hydrostatic pressure and impedes venous return of the blood back to the heart. That is why your face becomes engorged with blood.\nThere are numerous causes of stroke, ranging from ischemic or lack of blood flow to thrombotic/ embolic, development of blockage / launching of a blood clot.\nLet’s assume you are trying to prevent an ischemic stroke. The trouble is, anytime throughout the day where your blood pressure drops low enough that a certain area of your brain is unable to get blood flow, you are at risk for developing stroke symptoms. The longer that goes on, the higher the risk and more severe the symptoms.\nSo even if hanging upside down helped decrease the risk of stroke while you were inverted, the risk would return when you sat up or became upright again and your blood pressure adjusts.\nI hope this helps!"}
{"_id": "3c4f1add", "question": "Why do people have strokes and how can they be prevented?", "answers": "People have strokes because the blood supply to part of their brain has been interrupted. There are two basic types, ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes occur when the blood flow is blocked, perhaps by a blood clot. Hemorrhagic strokes occur from bleeding into the brain from a ruptured or damaged vessel. There are many causes; everything from uncontrolled blood pressure to diabetes to atherosclerosis, obesity, and old age puts you at risk. There are no known preventatives, but you can control some of your risk factors. Keep up with your health screenings, maintain a health weight, check your blood pressure and sugars regularly, get enough exercise, and eat a healthy diet.

{"_id": "47c0eb1e", "question": "Is there any type of device on the market today that will warn a gardener to get inside the house and stop their activity to prevent heat stroke?", "answers": "Yes. A thermometer.\nHeat stroke is the result of 'denaturing' proteins (in the brain) with heat.\nWhat's a 'denatured' protein? I'm sure you've seen an example. Proteins are strings of amino acids. They have very specific shapes because the electrical charges on some of the amino acids, and links among other amino acids pull them into the shape that they must keep, if they are going to do their job. One protein you've seen many times is albumin. It's made by many animals. The one that chickens make is often called egg 'white'. If it were fertilized, that albumin would be converted into lungs, beak, etc. But a non-fertilized egg can be heated until the albumin denatures. In its denatured state it's solid…a hard (boiled) egg.\nA human who suffers central temperatures > 107–108 F undergoes far less denaturation than a boiled egg, but it can be enough to make the cells of our most demanding organ (brain) fail. If a little fails, you'd call it a stroke. If enough, it causes death. That is how kids left in a car on a sunny day die. Interestingly, despite every parent's fear, very few infections can cause enough temperature rise to risk this. Exceptions include malaria and dengue.\nHeat exhaustion is just enough malfunction to cause tiredness, but not enough for a stroke. But sometimes people pass from one to the next because the central temperature isn't lowered soon enough.\nThe elderly, and people with spinal cord defects are more vulnerable to heat injury because their autonomic nervous system is less reliable. That is the system that shunts blood (flushing and pale-ness) and controls sweating. When they overheat, it's harder to restore a normal temperature without much lower temperature (air or water) around them. Even in a fit, young adult, malfunction of the autonomic nervous system is sometimes a hint (to others) that a person is in trouble: when they should be flushed and sweating, instead they are pale and dry.\nSweating, resting, and other methods help lower temperature, but strong-willed people sometimes don't use them.

There are two kinds of strokes. Hemorrhagic and Ischemic. As with\nheart disease and cancer, genetics play a huge part in whether you suffer a stroke or not.\nAs with all things health-related, lifestyle choices are the only way you can help prevent heart disease, cancer, and strokes. Eat a healthy diet, exercise, refrain from the use of illicit drugs, smoking, and overindulging alcohol and have regular physical exams. Even with all of those good things, there are no guarantees in life. You can only do your part in the management of your own health!"}

{"_id": "af6cf594", "question": "Is it wise for the average person to take low dose aspirin as a cancer prevention strategy, or does the risk of hemorrhagic stroke outweigh the benefit?", "answers": "First, I'm not sure where this idea that aspirin can prevent cancer is coming from. Do you have a study or medical guideline that suggests it to be true?\nSecond, the use of aspirin for primary prevention of heart issues is rather dubious itself. At best you'll find that multiple studies contradict each other on if there is an actual benefit, and then if the benefit is worth the risk. Major heart health guidelines (AHA/ACC, JNC) don't recommend aspirin for primary prevention of heart disease or incident.\nThird, there have been two recent studies which unexpectedly found an increase in cancer risk among aspirin users. Now, both of these studies say that they feel this is an anomaly in the data, but it is part of the current literature.\nSo, I guess my question is, what are you talking about?"}
{"_id": "e3988403", "question": "Is it true that 80 percent of strokes and cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by how you live?", "answers": "Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.\nPeople with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management using counselling and medicines, as appropriate."}

{"_id": "7b1e876c", "question": "What are the best indicators of a brain stroke that can be monitored so as to help prevent it early enough? Are there non-invasive ones? Are brain waves a reliable predictor?", "answers": "Monitoring BP is a key. That is non-invasive and can be done at home a couple times every day.\nAn MRI with and without contrast can help identify any malformations of veins or arteries as well as any aneurysms before they burst.\nMy stroke was hemorrhagic, so I am less versed on prevention of an ischemic stroke (where a blood vessel is blocked), but maintaining appropriate weight, reasonable cholesterol levels and moderate physical activity are all good.\nBrain waves are not a useful indicator, though binaural beats can be used to reduce stress, lower BP and improve sleep — all good things for the brain."}
{"_id": "ad410e19", "question": "If we can use genetic engineering to prevent the atherosclerosis (fatty plaques) formation in the first place, will we get rid of heart diseases and strokes?", "answers": "Atherosclerosis is caused by a transferase chemical reaction with the hormones norepinephrine and epinephrine which breaks down elastic polymers in the walls of the arteries. Plaques that form in the arteries are a consequence of that artery damage. Excessive release of those hormones is promoted primarily by stress and by a poor lifestyle and diet. Genetic engineering will do nothing to relieve stress or influence people to adopt a healthier lifestyle and diet."}

They took me off the BP meds.\nI’m eating loads of vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and fruits with some yogurt, eggs, fish, poultry, cheese and milk. I’m also walking a lot (for a stroke survivor). Exercise and whole foods seem to help.I measure my BP at least 2x every day. My doctors monitor it as well. Last time I saw the doc, her nurse asked me if my BP usually runs low. A huge change for the better!\nIf your doctor says you have high BP, take the pills while you improve your lifestyle. Don’t risk a stroke."}
