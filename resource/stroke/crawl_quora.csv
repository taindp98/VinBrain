beeae70b,How do I take care of a person who suffered stroke disease?,"It is lovely that you want to learn. Speak with the doctor and therapists about specific precautions.
Remove throw rugs and clear the floor of things one might trip on. Install hand rails around stairs and grab bars in the bathroom/shower/toilet.
Encourage him/her to do whatever s/he can do safely. Falling is common and can cause serious injury because normal reflexes to protect the head don’t always kick in. Another brain injury could cause further damage.
Find tools that help the person be independent. For example, a “rocker knife” will let him/her cut food with one hand, so s/he doesn’t need someone to cut his/her food into bite sized pieces.
Recovery will continue for the rest of his/her life if s/he continues to work on improving and if s/he is permitted to try. I climbed six storeys on Saturday because the elevator was out of service. My husband had said “you can’t do that” but I could and I did. I held tightly to the rail and took a break on the last landing to regain my breath, but I made it.
Give them time to master skills — don’t assume they can’t do something just because they are awkward initially. We are survivors not victims."
95b1e55d,Is it really true that blood groups other than O type are more prone to heart attack and heart/stroke diseases?,"There is an association with heart disease and non-O+/- blood groups. The exact reasons are not known, so causation has not been established. The increased risk is less than 10%.
Your Blood Type Could Be Linked to a Higher Risk of Heart Attack or
Stroke"

595a06ea,Is stroke linked to Alzheimer's disease?,"No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.
However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else. And what a stroke can do- besides causing dementia, itself- is speed up the damage going on in the brain when any kind of dementia is already present.
And, keep in mind it is thought Alzheimer’s is “present” but undiagnosed because it just hasn’t gotten to the point it is interfering with life, up to ten years before such interference, so that, a stroke in that ten or-so year period can make it seem it was the cause of Alzheimer’s. It likely wasn’t; it just sped up the damage.
Avoiding a stroke is one of the top five ways to avoid any dementia. Doesn’t mean no-stroke-no-dementia, just that stroke is, itself indicted in some forms of dementia."
d560ef77,Can you get a stroke from having aortic valve disease?,"Yes but that depends on what sort of aortic arch “disease” your talking about. If it’s a congenital coarctation malformation,Aortic stenosis, aneurism or aortic stricture it can cause areas of restricted or pooled blood flow. Technically yes anytime you slow dwell time in blood vessels tiny emboli can develop. In the case of the Aorta it can cause emboli to get thrown up the carotid artery and cause strokes (Aka emboli or embolic showers) in the brain. Often if this is discovered it’s highly recommended to take long term anticoagulants. Surgery or minimal invasive procedures are often recommended.
I want to stress that although concerning, this kind of disease can be well monitored managed and followed up on. You may need to see one or more specialists. Find a good health provider doctor,nurse practitioner or physicians assistant and start with a full health physical H&P (history and physical exam) People can live long relatively healthy lives with Aortic arch problems."
947ab37d,What are the exercises to prevent heart disease and stroke?,"Sometimes, muscle mass exercise, aerobic exercise, and lung health can greatly effect the health of the heart.
The health of the heart, is related to the lungs.
Exercise, aerobic exercises of all sorts, promotes the formation of capillaries, and vessels and additional blood supplies through vessels that only happens through stress and exercise that promote the formation of.
Some of those of outside capillaries that can grow and give vessels to supply oxygen to the heart muscle. (On the outside of the heart muscles to provide capillaries and then oxygen)
Exercise can spur that in the body.
Heart disease is a lot of things, genetics, and damages, many things not under the control of the individual.
The heart muscle cells, not not regenerate, so things that had and adverse effect, the heart muscles and cells does not recover or regenerate.
Exercise, can create or spur other capalery effect on the outside of the heart muscle to feed them, with good nutrition and exercise.
A very slight affect, but real effect, to feed the existing heat cells, with oxygen through capalery growth.
Aerobic activity, and types of exercises stresses the system and stimulates the body to produce capillaries, to create new ones to feed organs like, such as the heart muscle."
4dba3508,What can I do to reduce my risk of heart disease and stroke?,"See , if u have hypertension or high cholesterol , feel angina pain in chest where heart is situated , than better take necessary precautions by doing pranayaam that is breathing exercises in yoga and do it properly looking in u tube , do it regularly , but before that 40 min of warm up exercises at home is must and do it gently according to your age , physiological status …..u can take advice of some yoga experts….
Have light , nutritious , delicious diet full of vitamins and minerals , but eat little less , eat little 4 times so that it will not put pressure in your heart , oil and salt are enemies of heart so avoid having oily spicey , junk food , alcohol , smoking , stress , over burden of work at home .
Eat less salt and sugar , have fruits but wash them properly with water , have lot of oranges , lemon juice water in empty stomach in morning , maintain hygiene , have liquid diet , no overeating of food ….all these factors will help to maintain your health. Get check your bp level and sugar levels if possible . And u can take advice from doctor too in phone . Some people having cardiac problems on doctor's advice keep sorbitol or aspirin at home if u feel severe pain keep one of these under your tongue , but take doctor's advice first , i am not doctor so i can't advise u …..
Hence quality food and physical exercises , meditation help to cope up with such problems….Thank you……"
f0148c18,"I want to try the paleo diet, but it claims that potatoes are bad—and doesn't red meat cause strokes and other diseases?","While many on the paleo diet do not eat potatoes, many certainly do. Often the level of starches/carbs is based on someone's goals and activity levels. Higher levels of activity = higher carb intake. Sweet potatoes and white rice are usually the go-tos but white potatoes have their place as well. Additionally there is evidence that white potatoes in the form of resistant starch
can be beneficial for gut bacteria.
As for red meat causing diseases (as many others have pointed out) this is nonsense. Don't determine your diet by what the headlines say is the latest superfood or what food is going to kill you. Its bullshit. Do your homework.
The paleo diet has never been about re-enactment, its a framework for living an optimal life based on human appropriate food, movement, sleep, etc. Over the past few years, the ""paleo diet"" has evolved to be more about real, whole foods than the previous strict dogma. Many folks have started including beans, potatoes, etc. based on their tolerance to these foods and overall health goals.
Find out what works for you and don't get hung up on the minutiae."

09bf7072,What are foods that prevent heart disease and stroke?,"20 Foods That Can Help Prevent Heart Disease
1 – Fresh Herbs
When you add these to foods instead of salt and fat, you’re making a heart-healthy choice. They add flavor without the bad stuff. Spices and other foods are delicious ways to eat heart-smart.
2 – Black Beans
Mild, tender black beans are packed with heart-healthy nutrients. Folate, antioxidants, and magnesium can help lower blood pressure. Their fiber helps control both cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Add beans to boost soups and salads.
Prep Tip: Rinse canned beans to remove extra salt.
3 – Red Wine and Resveratrol
If you drink alcohol, a little red wine may be a heart-healthy choice. Resveratrol and catechins, two antioxidants in red wine, may protect artery walls. Alcohol can also boost HDL, the good cholesterol.
Tip: Too much alcohol hurts the heart. Don’t have more than one drink a day for women or two drinks for men. It’s best to talk to your doctor first. Alcohol may cause problems for people taking aspirin and other medications.
4 – Salmon: Super Food
A top food for heart health, it’s rich in omega-3s. Omega-3s are healthy fats that may lessen the risk of heart rhythm disorders and lower blood pressure. They may also lower triglycerides and curb inflammation. The American Heart Association recommends two servings of salmon or other oily fish a week.
Cooking Tip: Bake salmon in foil with herbs and veggies. Toss extra cooked salmon in fish tacos and salads.

9d76154c,"Is it true that there is no proof of cholesterol lowering drugs lowering the rates of heart attacks and strokes? Instead, there is proof that consuming cholesterol lowering drugs contributes to the risks of having other diseases like diabetes, etc.","I am a scientist, and the only thing that matters to me is evidence, and quality of evidence matters most. Although your question is prejudicial, I will try to answer it nevertheless.
Firstly, there actually is robust evidence that cholesterol lowering drugs, called statins, have a statistically significant causal effect on lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. A systematic review (considered the pinnacle on the hierarchy of biomedical research
), published by the Cochrane Collaboration
, concluded that:
Of 1000 people treated with a statin for five years, 18 would avoid a major CVD event which compares well with other treatments used for preventing cardiovascular disease. Taking statins did not increase the risk of serious adverse effects such as cancer. Statins are likely to be cost-effective in primary prevention.
Systematic reviews roll up results from a large number of clinical studies, in this case 19 studies, to remove bias and other issues. In this case, statins clearly save lives.
Furthermore, the standard of care of most healthcare plans state that aggressively treating cholesterol in patients leads to better outcomes. Which means the healthcare plan is spared the expense of paying for angioplasty, stents, bypass surgery, and other expensive medical procedures.
As for stroke, statins have shown no significant causal effect on the risk of stroke. However, modern evidence-based medicine attacks stroke risk independent of cholesterol levels.
With respect to adverse effects,
there is no robust evidence that supports a causal effect between statin use and diabetes. In fact, diabetes is, in itself, linked to cardiovascular disease.
there is no robust evidence of a causal link between statins and cancer.
there is some evidence of rare and reversible cognitive decline with the use of statins. Once it is recognized by the physician, the FDA urges that the patient not receive the medication any longer.
there is also some evidence of muscle pain with the use of statins. However, there are a lot of confounding factors, like diabetes and high blood pressure, which could be linked to the muscle pain.
I know it’s cool for some people to criticize the use of statins because of some huge Big Pharma conspiracy. Unfortunately for them, the real scientific and clinical evidence contradicts those claims.
Oh one more thing. Science doesn’t “prove” anything – it makes provisional conclusions based on evidence supporting or nullifying a hypothesis.
Mathematics, albeit a science, uses proofs, which are inferential arguments within a mathematical statement."
4c13b768,"How do I prevent hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and stroke?","IHigh blood pressure is also known as hypertension. Blood pressure is the amount of force exerted by the blood against the walls of the arteries as blood flows through them.
blood pressure is the most common problem which is faced by 30% of the population of the world.
If left untreated or uncontrolled, high blood pressure can cause many health problems. These conditions include heart diseases, vision loss, stroke, and kidney disease ,
Causes
The risk of developing hypertension increases as people age.
The heart is a muscle that pumps blood around the body.
Blood that has low oxygen levels is pumped towards the lungs, where oxygen supplies are replenished. The oxygen rich blood is then pumped by the heart around the body to supply our muscles and cells. The pumping of blood creates pressure.
If a person has high blood pressure, it means that the walls of the arteries are receiving too much pressure on a constant basis.
The causes of high blood pressure are divided into two categories:
Essential high blood pressure: This has no established cause.
Secondary high blood pressure: There is an underlying cause.
Even though there is no identifiable cause for essential high blood pressure, there is strong evidence linking some risk factors to the likelihood of developing the condition.
Most of the causes below are risk factors for essential high blood pressure. There are also examples of secondary high blood pressure:

The older you are the higher your risk of having high blood pressure. www.healthpot9.blogspot.com"
760baea9,What type of disease is a stroke?,"A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds, or when there’s a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. The rupture or blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain’s tissues.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stroke is the fifth-leading trusted Source cause of death in the United States. Every year, more than 795,000Trusted Source U.S. people have a stroke."
840594b8,Is a stroke considered coronary artery disease?,"It is not. Coronary arteries supply blood to the heart tissue only. Strokes occur in the brain, far away from the heart.
However, both result from ischemia in the target organ and are caused by very similar mechanisms of hypertension that primes arteries for atherosclerosis which decreases blood supply to tissues, and unstable plaque, ruptured by hypertension, that then forms a clot which blocks blood delivery to either a part of the brain to provoke a stroke or an area of the heart to provoke a heart attack. Hemorrhagic strokes are also common.
A stroke is a cerebral artery (cerebrovascular) disease or an ischemic brain disease while a heart attack or angina pectoris is a coronary artery or an ischemic heart disease. Both are cardiovascular diseases as they involve the heart’s action on blood vessels and blood vessel’s impact on the heart’s action."
bef45c2b,What is the mechanism of action of citicoline? Why is it used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and stroke?,"Citicoline (Cytidine-5′-diphosphocholine or CDP-choline), an intermediate in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), is one of the cell membrane components that is degraded during cerebral ischaemia to free fatty acids and free radicals.[1]
It increase the brain phosphatidylcholine, which is important for brain function. The therapeutic action of citicoline is thought to be caused by stimulation of PtdCho and sphingomyelin synthesis, and by inhibiting the destructive processes (activation of phospholipases)in the ischemic brain[2]
Citicoline neuroprotection may include-
preserving cardiolipin (an exclusive inner mitochondrial membrane component) and sphingomyelin;
preserving the arachidonic acid content of PtdCho and phosphatidylethanolamine;
partially restoring PtdCho levels;
stimulating glutathione synthesis and glutathione reductase activity;
attenuating lipid peroxidation;
restoring Na+/K+ATPase activity.[3]
Citicoline also provides choline for synthesis of neurotransmitter acetylcholine, stimulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and dopamine release.
Citicoline: (a) acetylcholine, PtdCho, AdoMet and GSH biosynthesis and (b)␣sphin- gomyelin synthesis.[4]

5526115b,What's the point of learning a new language if you can get Alzheimer's disease or have a stroke and lose all of that knowledge?,"What's the point of being awake? What's the point of knitting? What's the point of cooking? What's the point of a hot bath? What's the point of watching Doctor Who? What's the point of falling in love? What's the point of literally anything?
Things have value intrinsic to themselves and to you, at that time and place in your life. That they may not be as important in a different time and place in your life is both okay and, I feel that this is important to say, doesn't negate their value they held. They still hold that value, and they always will.
Why? Experience changes us. Surely that means something. Experience means the exact people that we influence directly and indirectly are influenced pretty directly by our experiences in life.

2357315a,Can sickle cell disease cause a stroke?,"Yes lack of oxygen from the sickled red blood cells can cause stroke, children are checked from 2 to 17 to see if they have a propensity for stroke by using transcranial doppler testing. If found that they are likely to having a stroke they begin chronic blood transfusions or blood exchanges in effort to keep the oxygen flowing consistently to the brain."
d9421e2d,"Does eating one meal a day cause diabetes, stroke and heart disease?","It depends not only on how often you eat, but also in what you eat. If you don’t eat fast-absorbing carbohydrates (as in refined flour, white rice, potatoes) and instead eat fat, protein and fiber rich meals (or slow carbs like in lentils, beans or chick peas), your blood sugar will not have big spike.
These foods are also more filling than carbohydrate rich foods and will help control hunger better, not the other way around.
I would not eat once a day because I like stopping for a meal (and eating) and I don’t see many advantages to eat besides time saving.
That being said, the refered article is vague and outdated in my opinion, as it does not make any reference to which kind of diet it is talking about."

Thoughts?","If I may, I’d like to answer with a few starting assumptions that can lead you to an answer to your question based on the beliefs and knowledge that gave meaning and joy to the lives of three good women we’ve lost this last year, at least during our time on earth.
Here are the beliefs that I know all three shared that can serve as a starting point (premises, if you will) for your consideration of the answer I’d like to offer at the end:
God is the embodiment of perfect love
We are God’s children in the sense that God is the Father (Creator) of our spirits, having created us from eternal, pre-existing intelligence - namely the raw energy of our will, mind, and awareness.
God gave us free will from the beginning of our existence as spirits.
In God’s glorious presence, where there can be no evil, pain, suffering, illness or death, our innocent spirits could never have learned good from evil because there was no evil.
God created this Earth to be separate from God’s presence, as a training and proving ground for His children. We are living in a fallen state as a result of the transgression of the first of God’s children - Adam and Eve - when God put the “breath of life” (spirits created by God) into their homo sapiens human bodies.
God has given each of us free will and innate moral sensibilities to accompany the gifts of reason, intelligence, and creative capacity in this life to LEARN good from evil and the consequences of each. Good = Peace, love, joy, truth, faith, and life. Evil = Conflict, hatred, lies, pain, suffering, and death. Etc.
We all sin, and are thus forever unworthy.
So God sent His Son to a human mother in order to atone for our sins and take upon Himself the infinite sufferings and pain and injustice from all the sins and evil of all mankind, that we can repent of our sins and through baptism accept God’s grace and the cleansing power of the symbolic blood He shed for us.
Through faith, learning, and prayer, we gain access to incredible truths about this temporary state we’re in that teach us to choose the good (which comes from God) and eschew the evil (which comes from the Father of Lies, aka Satan).
So illness, disease, suffering, and more are a natural result of the fact that we are living in a fallen state.
As we are now learning (through the work of Dr. Martin Seligman and the Positive Psychology
movement), science is beginning to catch up with and reinforce the positive principles of hope, optimism, and positive thinking - consistent with what I’ve learned from the time I was a child as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which principles I’ve articulated above.
Even if you’re currently hostile towards religion, you might want to consider that science and common sense will tell you that there are certain beliefs and attitudes and knowledge that help anyone thrive even under whatever difficult conditions or circumstances that life may throw at us. Even the threat of impending death need not hold us as victims bound by fear. I will soon share examples.
I would simply assert in all sincerity that anyone who has faith in a loving God who will help us overcome evil, pain, and suffering has an enormous head start in being positive, thriving, and recovering no matter what may come our way.
In the past year, I lost my mother-in-law (March ‘20), favorite aunt (August ‘19), and sister-in-law (July ‘19) - all to cancer, although I believe my mother-in-law died from undiagnosed COVID-19, since three of her caregivers tested positive, and one, her son, was hospitalized with COVID-19 and thankfully recovered).
My point is that every one of those noble women faced their death with faith, peace of mind, hope and joy. There is no reason whatsoever that we must view cancer, coronavirus, strokes, or dementia or any of the trials of this life with fear, angst, or bitterness.
Instead, trust in God’s love and His promises of eternal life through the salvation offered by His Son, Jesus Christ. Turn away from the nihilistic betrayal of hope represented by the modern lies perpetrated by the foolish who define faith as belief in that which is contrary to reason rather than the way God defines faith: as trust in those truths that can’t be seen (i.e. known by the senses and logic alone). There is no conflict between faith and reason, or between true religion and true science.
So consider instead the faith, hope, and love offered by these loved ones we’ve lost this past year:
My Mother-in-law, Ann Danes.
My mother-in-law, Ann Danes, a widow, spoke of her longing to once again embrace her parents and husband in the spirit world after her release from this mortal “vale of tears.”
I’ll never forget the blessing of her visiting us here in Utah not long before her diagnosis, and the wisdom she shared with our family.
While in hospice care, she had a steady stream of friends and family visiting her and caring for her. She was playing the piano for as long as she had strength. To know Mom was to love her.
On Christmas, in the cold of Kuna, Idaho, she insisted we bundle her up and push her around in her wheelchair, surrounded by most of her 8 children and a lot of grandchildren, as we visited home after home singing the carols of hope and joy in the advent of a baby 2,000 years ago who would save us all from death and those who repent from sin.
She was a great lady, and when she hugged you, you KNEW you were loved.
My Wife Kathy with her sister, Annette Hiatt
My sister-in-law, Annette Hiatt, a cancer survivor since the ‘90s, inspired so many in the support groups she frequented, and changed the nature of the hospice care she was given, that they will be naming a care facility after her in Idaho Falls.
Annette inspired all of us during her decades-long fight with cancer, with her love of life, her readiness to laugh, her unfailing service to everyone fortunate enough to be around her, and all she did for her eight children and can’t-count-em-all grandchildren. My favorite memory is when she visited her gravesite and asked for a picture of her to be taken laying on her plat. Can’t find that picture, but this one gives you a good feel for her indominitable sense of humor about the lung cancer (that started as breast cancer) that made it so hard for her to breathe and ultimately took her life:
Note the sign that says “Out of Order.”
My aunt Darla touched tens of thousands of lives through her writing while she was alive, and continues to bless lives with her writing even now that she’s gone. Read what my beloved aunt wrote about her decision on how to spend the last few months of her life, and the courage behind her faith: What My Journey with Cancer Is Teaching Me
.
My Aunt, Darla Larsen Isackson
Darla was not spared the trials of life, from the time she was scalded by a kettle of boiling milk as a toddler and almost died. But she learned what God wanted her to learn from her trials, and was an incessant optimist. If you read her article, you will see those lessons on full display.
Her son Brian, a cousin I loved, ended his own life. Darla wrote a book about it: After My Son's Suicide
. This nearly perfect lady perhaps understandably struggled with perfectionism, but wrote an article about that too (Satan’s Counterfeit Gospel of Perfectionism
), prompting an Apostle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to quote her in General Conference, calling her an “insightful Latter-day Saint.”[1]
QUESTION: So why does God allow pain, illness, contagion, suffering, evil, death, loss, injustice, and all manner of wickedness amongst his children to torment our lives and afflict our hearts and minds?
ANSWER: To produce inspiring women of grace and love like those I’ve just described, through a refiners fire of facing and conquering all of the trials and tests of life. Truly they were loving daughters of a loving Father in Heaven.
And not to forget - God lets us men who are unworthy of such noble women learn from their example as we strive to overcome our own trials so we can be joined with the women we love and admire, eventually, in the unity of perfect love that our Father wants for each of us after we learn to embrace only that which is good (and leads to joy) and reject all that is evil (and leads to misery).
This life is our time to learn those lessons, through faith, study, pondering, and prayer.

A comorbidity pertains to a disease that exists stimultaneously with or worsens or affect the primary disease but suffering is how your mind takes on the disease as part of how you handle the disease and not necessarily a comorbidity as this is an attitude. An attitude is not a disease unless the disease causes despair from suffering because you can’t communicate or move, both of which relate to the disease. You have a choice to suffer or not (by accepting the stroke) but it can lead to mental illness (despair or suicide).
One thing that will happen to anyone is the grief process as you learn to accept the primary disease and this will happen to anyone with loss of any kind. So there will be depression as part of the stages of grief like loosing a loved one (or a part of yourself) but this is temporary and leads to acceptance not. Dealing with a disease, it is wise to read Elisebeth Kubler Ross’s Five Stages of Grief and know that is a normal route for all of us when confronted with disease that we have difficulty handling."
1d57e5fe,"Are there any scientifically proven natural alternatives to Warfarin? I have a rare congenital blood clotting disease which requires me to be on Warfarin since that disease was first diagnosed in 2008, followed 8 weeks later by an ischemic stroke.","No. Warfarin is a very well understood drug. It's a mess to take, but it does exactly what it's supposed to. Any natural remedy that had the same level of precision would very quickly become a medical drug. However, many warfarin patients today switch to other, newer medical drugs that weren't around in 2008. Talk to your doctor about it would be my suggestion."
a8e19776,Is it dangerous to stroke a cat? Can you get a disease because of just touching a cat?,"Depends on the cat and what their body language looks like at the time. There are some exceptions to the rule, but in general the chart below is pretty accurate. For a strange cat, I would only pet between the 1–2 range on this chart. For a familiar cat, you can typically push it to the 3–4 range if trying to sooth the cat, however at this point I would call the cat and let them come to you if they *want* to. Never push pettings on a cat above 1–2 if they don't voluntarily come to you, or you risk making the cat feel trapped / man-handled.
For some cats their show of displeasure at being petted when they didn't really want to be is not all that offensive — if I pet or pick up my current cat when she wasn't really looking for that level of attention, she kinda squeaks like a toy and pouts. For my last cat, if you reached toward her when she wasn't ready, she would get very ornery, up to and including scratching.
So go slowly, and watch the cat’s body language. Remember to stroke from head to tail, never in reverse unless you know the cat and they are fond of such a thing — otherwise you may annoy them, especially directly after they've licked their coat clean, because you're ruining their “do”.
Oh — and don't let them smell your fear."

43813afe,Can celiac disease cause a stroke?,"Not particularly.
If it is untreated, then the resulting mineral and vitamin deficiencies might.
Celiac disease results in damage to absorbtive surface of the gastrointestinal tract which leads to decreased absorbtion of iron and vitamin B12.
Iron deficiency anemia is a risk factor for stroke as it causes a compensatory increase in number of platelets predisposing to stroke.
Vitamin b12 deficiency increases homocysteine levels in blood again predisposing to stroke (Dont remember the exact mechanism)
If the resultant malabsorbtion is minimal either due to early detection and inititation of gluten free diet or due to supplementation, then there is no significant risk."

0acb4653,"Modern humans have between 2 to 5% of Neanderthal DNA in their makeup and it is thought by some, that interaction with them 60,000 odd years ago now contributes to serious human ailments such as cancer, heart disease and strokes. Is this possible?","Modern people in many places (including the US) have some ‘mixed’ ancestry if you define that as having genetic variation derived from more than one distant place (like Europe, India, Asia, Africa). This is because there has long been some inter-breeding (and the populations aren’t totally isolated from each other). So the 2–5% figure is no surprise but even that depends on first defining what counts as ‘Neanderthal’. Neanderthals, for example, were just Europeans at some particular time in the past that we, as anthropologists, define by giving them a name.
Every region’s genomic variation includes some that involves susceptibility to diseases, usually also depending on lifestyle factors (like diet). So there is nothing particularly risky about ‘Neanderthal’ DNA compared to other DNA. The kinds of late-onset diseases that you mention are mainly affected by lifestyles and we know that a lot of that is recent and has nothing to do with distant ancestry. Further, as these diseases generally strike late in life, and most humans in the Neanderthal (and, indeed, until recent) times didn’t live long enough to get them, so they basically aren’t ‘disease’ genes (and, technically, you should refer to disease-susceptibility genotypes or alleles in some copies of genes, not ‘genes’ themselves).
So, generally, there are many subtle assumptions built into your question, and are widespread in thinking and writing about these past times, but should be more carefully thought-out."

01e48162,"Has COVID and lockdown created a pandemic of health-related incidence of strokes, heart disease and obesity?","No.
As an example Scotland has a population about 5 million, and usually about 1,000 to 1,200 deaths a week depending on time of year. National Records of Scotland have been publishing data on excess deaths by cause of death (as stated on the death certificate) by week. (The graph below is for the weeks up to the end of June. They stopped publishing these numbers when ‘excess deaths’ fell to noise level.) It shows the number of Covid-19 deaths, which are all ‘excess’ because it did not exist last year. It also shows a consistent drop in the number of deaths from other respiratory diseases, a consistent increase in the ‘Others’ category, but not any significant change in other causes. (See the dark grey bars below the ‘0’ line which indicate 30–40 fewer deaths per week for ‘Respiratory’ compared to the corresponding week of an average year.)
The drop in ‘Respiratory’ deaths may be because the Covid-19 precautions also cause a decrease in other respiratory infections, or that people who would otherwise be dying of other respiratory conditions are instead succumbing to Covid, or both, or something else entirely.
The ’Others’ category has shown a consistent increase. This number is not broken down further at this point, but is often dominated by accidental deaths by trips and falls at home and accidental overdoses."

e31b4006,"Humans now live over three times as long as we did when our species first emerged. If we cured the top killing diseases such as cancers, stroke, and brain diseases, how much further could science extend human life expectancy?","I don’t think it’s easy to “cure” diseases like cancers, stroke, and brain diseases. Each of these ailments have multifactorial causes, and even within each of these diseases, there are many different types, which also have multifactorial causes.
For instance, there is no one, universal cure for cancer. Every cancer has a unique etiology and thus requires different modes of treatment. Because human bodies vary in so many ways, two people will not react exactly the same to the same regimen even if they are diagnosed with the same cancer type and stage. Also, while there can certainly be a genetic component or predisposition for a certain type of cancer, predisposition does not always equate manifestation. This is because inheriting a faulty gene may not be enough to trigger cancer; a series of genetic mutations must accumulate to develop into a diagnosable cancer. Most cancers have no known genetic predisposition. One thing people can do to lessen the chance of developing cancer is to quit smoking or never pick it up to begin with.
Strokes and brain diseases—also very broad diseases. People can be genetically predisposed to having strokes or brain diseases. Diet plays a role. Infections from bacteria, viruses, parasites, prions as far a brain diseases go. You know what can help decrease your chance of having a stroke though? Quit smoking or never pick it up to begin with.
As an aside, there are certain diseases that have been thought to confer some kind of resistance to other diseases. This is best typified by sickle cell anemia, which is much more prevalent in areas where malaria is endemic. While being homozygous for the alleles that confer the sickle cell trait can be particularly damaging and shorten life expectancy, heterozygous individuals have been found display some kind of resistance to the Plasmodium parasite which causes malaria.[1]It’s possible that sickle cell and malaria being prevalent in similar regions is purely coincidental, or there could have been some kind of evolutionary advantage to passing on the sickle cell allele in some instances.
So how easy is it to eliminate a disease? Sure, there are definitely, many, many diseases that don’t and ought not confer any kind of evolutionary advantage. We’re still trying to figure that out.

The problems arise when those cycles got messed up for whatever reason.
The body allocates time for activity, eating, digestion, resting, and sleeping. When we do not allow to settle a stable cycle(s) a whole range of troubles arrises.
It does not mean that cycles of the body cannot change. But it must be in the way that we adapt to the requirements of our bodies and not vice versa."

897ea216,Will artificial intelligence be able to accurately predict future heart disease and strokes?,"Computers that can teach themselves from routine clinical data are potentially better at predicting cardiovascular risk than current standard medical risk models, according to new research at the University of Nottingham.
The team of primary care researchers and computer scientists compared a set of standard guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) with four 'machine-learning' algorithms – these analyse large amounts of data and self-learn patterns within the data to make predictions on future events – in this case, a patient's future risk having of heart disease or a stroke.
The results, published in the online journal PLOS ONE, showed that the self-teaching 'artificially intelligent' tools were significantly more accurate in predicting cardiovascular disease than the established algorithm. In computer science, the AI algorithms that were used are called 'random forest', 'logistic regression', 'gradient boosting' and 'neural networks'.
Dr Stephen Weng, from the university's NIHR School for Primary Care Research, said: ""Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of illness and death worldwide. Our study shows that artificial intelligence could significantly help in the fight against it by improving the number of patients accurately identified as being at high risk and allowing for early intervention by doctors to prevent serious events like cardiac arrest and stroke.
""Current standard prediction models like the ACC are based on eight risk factors including age, cholesterol level and blood pressure but are too simplistic to account for other factors like medications, multiple disease conditions, and other non-traditional biomarkers. These AI algorithms have the potential to help save more lives"".
Professor Jon Garibaldi and Dr Jenna Reps, of the Advanced Data Analysis Centre in the School of Computer Science, said: ""We were curious to find out how four modern machine learning algorithms would perform given the large data set of 378,256 patients from nearly 700 UK GP practices. Indeed, we think this is the first large scale investigation of this type using routine clinical data.
""Our results show that 24,970 cardiovascular events occurred over a 10 year follow-up period. Compared to the established risk prediction algorithm, all four algorithms improved overall prediction accuracy, from 1.7% to 3.6%, as determined by a metric called the 'Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve'. The highest achieving algorithm (neural networks) correctly predicted 7.6% more patients who eventually developed cardiovascular disease compared to the standard algorithm.""
The study concludes that the improved predictions offered by self-teaching algorithms are better at predicting the absolute number of cardiovascular disease cases correctly, while successfully excluding non-cases. The research team believes AI has a crucial role to play in the devising of healthcare tools of the future which will deliver personalised medicine, tailoring risk management to individual patients.
The team says improvement in predictive accuracy could be further explored using machine learning with other large clinical datasets, in other populations, and in predicting other disease outcomes. But future investigation of the feasibility and acceptability of machine-learning applications in clinical practice is needed before any real life clinical application of this new technology is rolled out.

It is a reasonably standard option for internal carotid lesions in the neck. It is not much harder to get a tiny catheter into arteries in the brain but because of both size consideration and the fact that lesions in the major vessel at the base of the brain are rarer than ICA issues n the neck it is very rarely done.
Aneurysm in the brain may be treated by a variety of techniques from inside the arteries.

57bef5ae,"Why do oily food, greasy food, and spicy food increase the chances of heart disease and stroke?","Oily food and greasy food has a large amount of fats. so after going in the lymphtaic system it is stored in the form of fat molecules which move through the blood to the adipose tissues. If the quantitiy of fats increases then the cholestrol level also increase . So when the blood is carried to the capillaries these fat molecules can cause blockage as the space is too narrow and when these reaches to the heart the flow of the blood gets difficult .
Spicy food leds to indigestion. No proper digestion of food leds to diarrhea. As the stomach is not able to accept the food the HCL increases and causes acidity. After going to the intestine the walls of the intestine is not getting hold of the food and therefore not digested. These kinds of food move away without providing any nutrients to the body.

Cancer survival rates have rocketed.
Everybody is going to die. Nobody survives many years after 100. The question is not whether you will die, but how long you will live. If doctors save you from cancer at 70, does that mean that they are plotting your death from stroke at 80?
The more you cure people of one disease, the more you seem to kill them of other diseases, later.

People who have restless leg syndrome (RLS) do tend to have other conditions such as cardiovascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, or Parkinson’s disease, but restless leg syndrome does not cause these.
Lyrica, also known as pregabalin is highly effective for your problem and people should get treated because RLS interferes so much with sleep. Here are some other meds commonly used for RSL: pramipexole (Mirapex), rotigotine (Neupro), and ropinirole (Requip),
I am a big believer that many problems result from some deficiency. I am sure you have already heard about magnesium, but there are others. “A 2014 study found that vitamin D supplements reduced RLS symptoms in people with RLS and vitamin D deficiency” and according to Healthline, “Supplementation with iron or vitamins D, C, or E can help certain people with RLS.”

The primary source of this problem is much more likely to be damage to the lining of the blood vessels, which release clotting factors which in turn cause the platelet aggregation and therefore the clots which cause strokes and heart attacks in some cases. Perhaps a haematologist might give you a more definitive and up-to-the-minute answer.
Early on in this pandemic, I thought that it was this damage to small blood vessels which was responsible for most of the effects on the lung, and resulted in the curious combination of low blood oxygen levels without much shortness of breath and the ease of artificial ventilation compared to other cases of viral pneumonia, which cause stiff lungs. However, I was wrong: the lack of shortness of breath seems to be due to an effect of the virus on the brain, while the relative ease of artificial ventilation is still unexplained."
d162ecf2,"Is eating meat, which is high in sulphur amino acids, linked to a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and non-alcohol fatty liver disease?","While a plant-based diet is generally considered healthier than a meat-based diet in preventing the risk of diabetes, not all meats affect the risk equally. As Professor Koh Woon Puay, Professor of Clinical Sciences at Duke-NUS Medical School (Duke-NUS), and her team found out, higher intake of red meat and poultry is associated with significantly increased risk of developing diabetes, which is partially attributed to their higher content of heme iron in these meats. This study provides the basis for evidence-based dietary recommendations to the Singapore population in mitigating diabetes risk and reducing the healthcare burden of this chronic condition.
These findings come from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, which recruited 63,257 adults aged 45-74 years between 1993 and 1998, and then followed them up for an average of about 11 years. The study found a positive association between intakes of red meat and poultry, and risk of developing diabetes. Specifically, compared to those in the lowest quartile intake, those in the highest quartile intake of red meat and poultry had a 23 per cent and 15 per cent increase in risk of diabetes, respectively, while the intake of fish/shellfish was not associated with risk of diabetes. The increase in risk associated with red meat/poultry was reduced by substituting them with fish/shellfish.
In trying to understand the underlying mechanism for the role of red meat and poultry in the development of diabetes, the study also investigated the association between dietary heme-iron content from all meats and the risk of diabetes, and found a dose-dependent positive association. After adjusting for heme-iron content in the diet, the red-meat and diabetes association was still present, suggesting that other chemicals present in red meat could be accountable for the increase in risk of diabetes. Conversely, the association between poultry intake and diabetes risk became null, suggesting that this risk was attributable to the heme-iron content in poultry.
This is one of the largest Asian studies looking at meat consumption and diabetes risk. While the findings are consistent with other Western studies that have shown that the increased intake of red meat and increase in heme-iron content of diet could increase the risk of diabetes, this study demonstrated the additional risk of red meat attributable to other possible chemicals, other than its heme-iron content. It also suggested that chicken parts with lower heme-iron contents such as breast meat, compared to thighs, could be healthier. Finally, the study also demonstrated the benefit of replacing red meat or poultry with fish/shellfish.
Describing the key take home message for the public, senior author of the study Professor Koh said, ""We don't need to remove meat from the diet entirely. Singaporeans just need to reduce the daily intake, especially for red meat, and choose chicken breast and fish/shellfish, or plant-based protein food and dairy products, to reduce the risk of diabetes. At the end of the day, we want to provide the public with information to make evidence-based choices in picking the healthier food to reduce disease risk.""
""Although a number of western studies have consistently shown that red meat consumption should be moderated, this study is highly relevant as it is based on local population and consumption patterns. The findings affirm HPB's recommendation to consume red meat in moderation, and that a healthy and balanced diet should contain sufficient and varied protein sources, including healthier alternatives to red meat such as fish, tofu and legumes,"" said Dr Annie Ling, Director, Policy, Research and Surveillance Division, Health Promotion Board.

Heart disease: Eating lots of red meat and full-fat dairy foods as part of a high-protein diet may lead to heart disease. This could be related to higher intakes of saturated fat.
A study has also showed that long-term consumption of red meat can increase trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut-generated chemical that is linked to heart disease. Findings also showed that reducing or eliminating dietary red meat reversed the effects.
Bone calcium loss: Diets that are high in protein and meat may cause calcium loss. This is sometimes associated with osteoporosis and poor bone health.
A 2013 study found an association between high levels of protein consumption and poor bone health. However, another study in the same year found that the effect of protein on bone health is inconclusive. Further research is needed to expand and conclude upon these findings.

Please correct me if I am wrong.
Heart disease can be from a genetic predisposition or self-inflicted. Same with stroke and cancer. Cancer has no magical property to determine if you are rich or poor prior to invading your cells. While using the general term 'cancer' you are literally describing several hundred separate diseases. Treatment for one will not necessarily work for another. Even determining what the cancer does does not necessarily translate quickly to treatment options. Thus the significant research budget.
Significant resources are spent annually for all of these things. How a person with substantial assets chooses to give to an organization is entirely up to them. If you personally know a wealthy individual, feel free to contact them requesting funds. Their choice to do so is entirely theirs, so make a good argument when you do so.

Cholesterol
is manufactured by every animal cell
on the planet.
Why? Because it is an essential structural component of every animal cell on the planet, including for ALL cells of human beings.
What does cholesterol enable animals to do which plants cannot do?
Answer: Rapidly change shape without cell damage, animals to move. Animals can go eat plants, the plants cannot move.
Given then fact, do animals, including humans absorb lots of cholesterol from food?
Answer: No! A basic homeostatic mechanisms
required to stay alive.
Since the primary source of all cholesterol in within, would increases in ingestion drive body cholesterol concentrations higher.
Answer: Largely No (beyond small transient increases)!
Given this fact, if cholesterol in body goes up, what happens to internal cholesterol production?
Answer: You guessed it, it goes down to compensate.
Another issue: Does cholesterol have anything to do with artery
disease
?
Answer: Largely No! As researched for 2–3 decades before finally figured out and published 1950
; study at least the abstract and notice the date of publication.
Since lipoprotein
s (complex protein particles which transport ALL fats in the water outside cells around our entire body) were identified, 1950, as the most important factor involved in artery disease progression over time, ALWAYS matches event rates over time, why was cholesterol promoted as an alternative (though never correct) concept?
Answer: Money and power while working (pretending?) to pay attention to the correct issues to help people.
Lipoproteins have long been divided into 5 major classes based on density ranges (what the D in HDL & LDL, two of the five classes) compared with the surrounding water.
Additionally, HDL particles have also been divided into 5 major classes and relation to artery disease event rates. On what basis?
Answer: You guessed it, by density, AKA size (an inverse of density)
This is a complex issue.

0d6926de,"""Vegans and vegetarians have a lower risk of coronary heart disease than meat-eaters but a greater risk of having a stroke, researchers have found"" is this statement true?","There are two types of stroke: majority of patients have ischaemic (lack of blood supply) stroke; only 13% patients have haemorrhagic (bleeds) stroke. stroke.
Underlying pathology for coronary artery disease is atherosclerosis, that causes heart attack and ischaemic stroke. High blood pressure is the leading cause of haemorrhagic stroke.
So, this question is stemming from the EPIC-Oxford study recently published in BMJ.
This study reported increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke, (not ischaemic stroke) with vegans/vegetarians. Also, in this study vegetarians had lower blood pressure than meat eaters, largely excluding high BP as the cause. The study is suggesting lack of nutrients (vit D, bit B12) as risk factors in vegetarian diet.
My take on the study: the groups were divided according to whether they were eating meat, fish or were vegans/vegetarians. No assessment was done with respect to the type of foods consumed in each group. A vegetarian largely consuming whole foods made at home would have an entirely different risk profile than a person consuming large amounts of processed food. This largely limits the significance of the increased stroke finding in vegetarian group.
How to translate to your life: largely consuming plant-based whole foods and keeping processed foods to the minimum is still the safest approach."

The labs will show that a heart attack has occurred but as of now, no tests can anticipate one or a stroke. That’s is because both can be caused by a clot in the heart or brain. They are very small. They are also not always a blood clot. Sometimes they are fatty clots. Plaque is also possible. It can break off and travel. A stroke can be caused by a bleed as well as a clot. A bleed occurs when a vessel in the brain breaks open and blood flows out. It requires very little volume as the brain fills the skull. Symptoms occur when pressure builds as more fluid leaks out. Again it doesn’t take much, around 5cc’s or less, noticeable symptoms appear. 10–15cc’s can cause a coma or death."

I am afraid only your Specialist/Oncologists advice and your own instinct/decision can be an answer, because there is still insufficient information & no one can tell you unless they are in the room & have all the evidence, visuals.
I get the impression that depending on where the vallecular cyst is it can be surgically drained - if the Doctors are not willing to do this to open your airways then can they explain why. I also believe if push came to shove they could intubate you directly through the trachea, though you can ask the Consultant exactly how they would do the Surgery for either as there may be options where surgery can be done without full intubation.
You can inform yourself by browsing the links, and if you don’t understand anything do searches for better explanations of the terms.

2 stroke has 2 cycles. With each cycle doing multiple things in each.
Compare to 4 stroke:
+ Better power band (single each down stroke is a power stroke).
+ Lighter (therefore higher power per weight ratio).
+ Easier to make (which translate to cheaper)
+ Plugs last longer
+ No valve adjustment/maintenance is needed (since the reed valve is a simple mechanism compare to the valve in the 4 stroke which rarely require adjustment)
- Worst fuel economy
- Worst for the enviroment
- Noisier
- Engines last much less
- 2 cycle oil is harder to get (with fewer options)
- uses more oil
Some progress has being made to improve the 2 stroke engine (like direct injection which eliminates the reed valve, but makes it more complicated to build, increase the weight but greatly improves the mileage and engine durability while reducing polution) but I am not aware of anyone mass manufacturing these.
4 stroke engine
4 stroke engines. Have 4 simpler cycles (which is cycle doing 1 main task)
Compare to 2 stroke:
+ Much better mileage (sometime double)
+ More environmentally friendly
+ Oil is available almost anywhere
+ No oil/gas mixture problems
+ Last longer
+ There are more engine types (sizes, types)
+ Not as noisy
Higher power weight
- less power
- heavier
- more complicated to make
- more expensive
- requires valve maintenance

IMO: In general, anyone wanting to get a scooter (something normally known for lack of power) is better off to get a scooter with a bigger 4 stroke engine than a 2 stroke engine scooter. There is more upfront cost but gas and durability makes it worth it."

2e494954,What does it feel like to have a stroke?,"It's May 9th 2018. My alarm sounds at 8:45pm. I have had a headache all day that wouldn't shift but it's the last of my night duties and I can enjoy a couple of days off. I sit up on the side of my bed. My head felt so much like it exploded that I turned around expecting my bed to be covered in blood. It hurts to hold my head up but I want to hyperextend my neck. Pain is shooting down my back. I am a nurse who works with brain injured patients. Immediately I am trying to make a clinical sense from my symptoms. I can barely stand. I tell my eldest daughter I can't go to work. It's less than an hour until my shift starts but she calls in for me. I am worrying for leaving it so late to call in. It's not always easy to get a night duty replacement at short notice so it means one of the evening shift will probably end up doing an 18 hour shift. My daughter and my work are telling me not to worry. They too know what I am describing. My daughter takes me to emergency and I am thankful that we only live 7 minutes from work. We get to emergency and of course they know me. I've worked at the hospital for a long time. They know what a thunderclap headache is …
I'm immediately put in for a CT Brain where they could see the bleed happening. I have burst an aneurysm in my subarachnoid space. It has bled through the Sylvian Fissure and 4 lobes are hit. By this time my GCS has fallen to 3 when it should be 15. I am unaware what is happening and I am taken to surgery for coiling by the Neurologist. The coiling was unsuccessful and again my vitals are dropping. Back to surgery where the neurosurgeon cut my hair off and opened my scalp to take a part of my skull out to perform an evacuation and clipping.
I wake up to a phone full of messages. My sister is at my bedside crying. I am immediately concerned and ask her what has happened, thinking she has come to tell me something terrible. She laughs gives me a hug and tells me everything is fine now. I can't make sense of the messages I have. Why are people asking me where I have been? Am I ok? Why is my long hair now so short it feels like stubble? Why are my eyes swollen and what are these metal clips across my skull for? Why do I have a tube running out of the top of my head?
The surgical team come in as the nurses have said I am awake. I listen to what the Neurosurgeon is saying. Burst aneurysm. 4 lobes involved. Another two aneurysms remain but not the time to operate on the left side of my brain as my right side needs to heal.
I am amazed at what has happened. Trying to process everything and marvel at so much happening yesterday to be thankfully awake today. Only it wasn't yesterday. I have lost a week in ICU. I can't remember anything after May 9th 2018.
I'm suddenly aware of my daughter's smiling when they tell me what day it is. It isn't until they remind me they have told me several times already what day it is. The nurses update my patient care board every day with current day/date and what the day will contain. I read it and then 5 minutes later I am asking what day it is and have we had breakfast.
The only thing I know is the pressure I feel in my head is immense. I am getting drugs orally and intravenously. Every 4 hours around the clock I am woken to take anti spasmodics. They are a godsend. The spasms in my head bring about immediate anxiety. I wonder why no one has gotten me out of bed to walk around. The bed rails make it hard for me to get myself up. I can hear patient buzzers going off and all I know is I need to get up to answer them but the other nurses won't let me. As soon as a buzzer sounds there is suddenly a nurse at my bedside telling me it's ok and one of the others are tending to the patient who is buzzing for a nurse.
The physio starts my therapy. I'm so unsteady on my feet and need an “old persons"" walker to help steady me. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH ME? This isn't making sense. I was perfectly fine “yesterday"".
After a number of weeks I am discharged into the care of the brain injury unit. They are heaven sent. I know a few of them through work even though it is an external unit. They work like a well oiled machine. Speech Therapy, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Pyschologist, Neuropsych, Social Work and the wonderful Rehab Consultant I have known since he was a resident.
It's been a long year. I have come to accept the shortcomings I have. My peripheral astigmatisms have improved. My depth perception makes for laughs. When the girls ask me to throw them a pen etc. it can be like a missile lol. I have a very sensitive area on my skull. Sometimes I can touch it and it's fine. Other times things like brushing my hair can make me jump like I've been shocked. I have to take medications every day and I am still under the care of the neurosurgical team as an outpatient. I have to have regular CT angiograms to check the status of my two remaining aneurysms.
I am now working on my return to work program. I am thankful that I have recovered as well as I have. I am even more thankful that my work kept my position for me so I had a job to go back to. I am blessed to have had the family and friends support I have.
My memory is back to normal. My brain fatigue is improving. I no longer need to sleep 18 hours a day. I maintain a healthy diet and exercise as per my improving tolerance. When I get tired I limp. My grip isn't as strong as it used to be but I am now able to open jars etc.
What I am thankful for is that (at the risk of sounding cliched) it has given me a new appreciation for life. I have always enjoyed the beauty that surrounds us and the simple pleasures but now I find I am more patient of not only others but of myself. I’m not in such a hurry to get here or there now. Traffic doesn't frustrate me. The long line at the grocery store is an opportunity to stop a while and be still.
Life is good … and I am thankful :)"
f019c8a7,What are the leading risk factors for having a stroke?,"If you can answer this in a Quora answer, I’d say you deserve the Nobel’s Prize in Medicine!
In some cases, it’s obvious what caused a stroke: if somebody’s obese, has really high blood pressure, is really old, etc., it’s pretty clear-cut.
But I was 115 pounds, 90/60, and 24 years old when I had my stroke. My doctors looked at me, referred me to a cardiologist for another test, which was negative, and told me to go on my way. “The chance of you having a subsequent stroke is very small,” they assured me.
Six months later, I was back in the hospital with another one. =(
About six months after THAT, I was able to peer out from beneath my lead jacket of fatigue and pick my head up enough to wonder WHY I’d had a second one. It’d be nice to figure it out, I wagered, to prevent a third one. At that point, I’d already decided that if I had another one, JUST LET ME DIE.
My speech therapist referred me to a neurologist at the big city hospital nearby. In retrospect, he was nuts, but he did decide to perform a test just to check for certain that the cardiologist I’d originally seen hadn’t missed anything. (The first test, a TEE — trans esophageal echocardiogram — checked for a hole in my heart by sticking a camera down my throat look to look at my heart. The second test, a TCD — transcranial doppler — shot minuscule bubbles into my arm via an IV and listened to my brain to see if any of them made it up there.) Lo and behold, it dinged! I had a hole in my heart that allowed bubbles/clots/etc to pass through a ventricle and into my brain.
But, a week later, the neurologist called and said he wasn’t sure that the hole was the cause of my stroked. He explained that doctors usually require both a hole and a hypercoagulable disease — i.e. you need a hole in your heart and a reason to have a clot. “Why the h*ll did you have me do this test, then?” I wanted to shout.
To make a long story short, I decided to go ahead and have surgery to close the hole. It’s not terribly risky, but it is heart surgery. I haven’t had another stroke in 12 years, I’ve had a very good neurologist tell me that clots sometimes form in the area right around the hole *just because*, I’ve had doctors tell me to get my head screwed on straight — everybody knows a hole isnt enough without a hypercoagulable disease … I’ve pretty much just given up having any chance of ever knowing what caused my strokes.
So please, figure it out! LOL"
1d542981,How can I prevent myself from having a stroke?,"Currently, we have no Heimlich maneuver for CVA, other than a substance called TPA, which is injected into the bloodstream and causes any clots to break apart, thus opening any blocked vesicles in the brain. BUT— and it’s a big but—
CVAs can be caused by clots (ischemic), yessireee, but they can also be caused by bleeds (hemorrhagic). If you have a bleed in your brain causing symptoms of stroke, and you just happen to have some TPA laying around, and you just happen to still be capable of injecting said TPA into your vein to break up a clot you think you have, do you know what happens? The bleed in your brain bleeds faster, and you could bleed out, because TPA works on clots, not bleeds.
So, you’re having stroke symptoms- sided weakness, some pins-and-needles, confusion- is it being caused by a clot or a bleed? Quickly now- guess correctly and quickly, you want to stop this immediately, remember?
Bzzzzzzt! Time’s up and guess what, you can’t know without a CT scan. What? You don’t have a CT scanner at your house? Well now what?! How are you going to stop this immediately without a CT scanner?
You are going to call 911 or whatever your emergency services number is, and let trained, qualified medical professionals do their job and get your clogged or bleeding brain to a hospital as fast as they can. Time is brain functioning in a stroke; we have stretched the golden hour to the golden three hours, but less than one hour is still best.
You will be immediately evaluated while in the ambulance and wheeled directly to radiology for that CT scan. The scan will be read by a neurologist who will determine if there is a bleed- no bleed, you’ll be offered TPA. You say yes, the nurse adds a small bag of clear fluid to your IV. Within minutes, you start to feel less confused, not so groggy. Every minute after that, you ‘clear’ a bit more. You may come all the way back in a matter of hours, there may always be some residual damage, you won’t know until you are on your individual journey.
If the scan showed a bleed, you will be whisked into surgery and the bleed will be stopped if possible- if accessible. Sometimes a transfusion of clotting factors can be given if the bleed cannot be reached. Then, of course, care must be taken there’s not a clot in the brain, too. You may come all the way back in a matter of hours, there may always be some residual damage, you won’t know until you are on your individual journey.
But, that is the best we have right now, and it is far and away better than what we had even a quarter century ago. Thank your lucky stars."
a64bf0e8,How do two-stroke engines differ from four-stroke engines?,"(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)
Two Stroke Engines
As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.
1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.
2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the ""Power Stroke"")
The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.
Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the ""Power Stroke"" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.
Disadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.
Four Stroke Engines
The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.
1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.
2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws
)
3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.
4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.

Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.
Disadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power."
6a8952fb,Why is four stroke engine prefered over two stroke engine?,"Working in a locomotive shop, I have experience with both 2 stroke and 4 stroke diesel engines.
Short answer: the reason why the 4 stroke has become more popular is because of efficiency and emissions.
Long answer requires some knowledge of how the 2 stroke engine works. In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.
Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger
6–71 Detroit Roots Blower
EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive
This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.
EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.
The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.
This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.
Efficiency
I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.
Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.
So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.
Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.
Emissions
So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.
Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine."
6d1fbe5c,What is a four stroke engine?,"Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..
An engine has two Valves which are connected on top of the cylinder or a combustion chamber which contains a Piston that is rotated by a Crankshaft..
2. First Valve is Intake valve which opens for Air and Fuel mixture..
3. Second Valve is Exhaust valve which opens for exhaust gases to escape after internal combustion..
4. A Spark plug which is responsible to ignite the air and Fuel mixture in the Cylinder..
So let us see the four Strokes..
FIRST SROKE (INTAKE)
The intake valve opens and allows the air and Fuel mixture to fill in the Cylinder there by pushing the Piston down which rotated through the Crankshaft by the connecting rod..
SECOND STROKE (COMPRESSION)
The Piston swivels up by one complete rotation and compresses the air and Fuel mixture both the valves remaining closed..
THIRD STROKE (POWER)
Spark plug ignites the air and Fuel mixture by creating an explosion in the cylinder and forcing the Piston down which creates power to engine and both valves remaining closed..
FOURTH STROKE (EXHAUST)
The Piston pushes out the burnt fuel through the exhaust valve which opens to lead the gases..
The above cycle repeats in the engine which drives the power to transmission and to the wheels.."
7ebf5591,Which one has higher efficiency: a two stroke or four stroke petrol engine? Why?,"Mechanical efficiency: 2-Stroke. Because theoretically a two stroke engine produces the same amount power in a single revolution of the crankshaft as that produced by a 4-stroke in two revolutions.
Volumetric Efficiency: 4-stroke. Because more time for mixing of fuel and supply.
Thermal Efficiency: 4-stroke. Thermal Efficiency = Work output/ Heat Input. Theoretically for the 2 stroke work output is double that of 4 stroke for a single revolution of the crankshaft and so is the fuel input. Practically, the work output is less and the since there are no separate valves, so a part of the incoming fuel mixes with the exhaust and leaves the chamber before burning. Hence the thermal efficiency will be less"
85b47b61,Why are the flywheels in a 2 stroke engine lighter than in a 4 stroke engine?,"The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.
The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves."
82c1d3c5,"Though a 2-stroke engine has a better power output than a 4-stroke engine even then we use 4-stroke engine in cars. Can we tweak a 2-stroke engine for better efficiency than a 4-stroke, why or why not?","The answer very easy. Emissions.
I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.
Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.
But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.
Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.
As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.
Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.
There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.
I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.
My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not."
4b6afc58,How does a 6 stroke engine work?,"Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.
A six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator. (As per HSW)
The video might clearly explain you that.
The main use of it is to increase the efficiency to near 40%. Actually the efficiency of petrol engines will be around 25-35%.."
aab1ad16,Can your mind heal after a stroke?,"It depends on several things.
This comes from personal experiences watching my father in law go through one.
1) type of stroke. A Hemorrhage is easier to recover from than a blocked vessel as it involves releaving the pressure. A blocked vessel is much harder to clear quickly.
There is still archangel for damage long term depending on reaction to symptoms. In his case it was too long if it was a clot, but because it was pressure he regained virtually all his functions back after removal and replacement of a piece of skull. Had it been a clot the time frame would have been FAR to long, almost 5-6 hours from symptoms to surgery to releive pressure.
I say mostly when it comes to his recovery. There are still some cognitive issues from damage bit if you didn't know him, you'd never notice.
2) location of the stroke. Certain locations are far less severe, but correct treatment is necessary. My grandfather had a stroke in his neck. Had he stayed at the hospital, and on bed rest, he'd have recovered with no issues. He believed nothing was wrong and felt fine in bed, so he checked himself out. He returned 2 hours later with a full on stroke and now struggles with movement on one side of his body.
His stubbornness against staying still and the location caused the issue.
3) time
The longer you wait the worse the recovery. Regardless of type or location of the stroke."
ab247f19,What is a stroke?,"When the blood flow to your brain is interrupted, it is a medical emergency known as a stroke. When the flow of blood to your brain is stopped the time it takes to get medical treatment is critical. As many neurologists will tell you, “Time is brain”. What this means is anytime the flow of blood to your brain is interrupted, the damage is occurring and prompt medical treatment at a hospital is needed. The sooner you can get medical treatment, the more likely you are to have a better outcome.
We usually think of stroke as a blood clot stopping the flow of blood in your brain. This is, in fact, the most common type of stroke called an ischemic stroke. According to the American Heart Association, 87% of stokes are estimated to be ischemic. There are three main types of stokes and all are considered medical emergencies.
Another type of stoke is a hemorrhagic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel ruptures in your head. This can be caused by an aneurysm, an arteriovenous malformation, or a weakened small blood vessel caused by very high blood pressure.
Lastly, a transient ischemic attack or TIA is also called a mini-stroke or a warning stroke. TIA’s are caused by a temporary blood clot that lasts for a shorter period of time. They are usually a warning sign that something is going on and a full ischemic stroke is likely if treatment is not sought.
Our brains are complex and affect all parts of our body including movement, speech, learning, and so much more. When the blood flow to your brain is stopped either by a clot or a bleed it is vital to your outcome to get medical treatment immediately. So how can you tell if someone is having a stroke? The American Stroke Association has set the following guidelines to help everyone recognize the common symptoms of a stroke.
Remember this acronym to help determine if someone is having a stroke: F.A.S.T.
Face- Does one side of the person’s face appear to be drooping? Ask the person to smile- does one side of their mouth drop down?
Arm- Is one arm weak? Ask the person to raise both arms- does one arm drop down?
Speech- Is it slurred or difficult to understand?
Time- Call 9-1-1- immediately. Time is brain! If you or someone you are with experience any of these symptoms, call 9-1-1 immediately.
While these are the most common symptoms, it should also be noted that if someone complains of the worst headache of their life, has sudden confusion, trouble walking, or sudden problems with coordination they can also be signs of a stroke and immediate medical attention is needed. Remember, stroke is a medical emergency and the sooner you can get help, the more you improve the chances for a better outcome. [1]

60712a8d,How does a two-stroke engine work?,"A two-stroke engine is a type of internal combustion engine which completes a power cycle with two strokes (up and down movements) of the piston during only one crankshaft revolution. Compared to four-stroke engines, two-stroke engines have a greatly reduced number of moving parts, and so can be more compact and significantly lighter.
2 Stroke Petrol Engine-
Its two strokes are described as follows:
Upward Stroke: During the upward stroke, the piston moves from bottom dead centre to top dead centre, compressing the air-petrol mixture in the cylinder. The cylinder is connected to a closed crank chamber. Due to upward movement of the piston, a partial vacuum is created in the crankcase, and a new charge is drawn into the crankcase through the uncovered inlet port. The exhaust port and transfer port are covered when the piston is at the top dead centre position. The compressed charge is ignited in the combustion chamber by a spark provided by the spark plug.
Downward Stroke: As soon as the charge is ignited, the hot gases force the piston to move downwards, rotating the crankshaft, thus doing the useful work. During this stroke the inlet port is covered by the piston and the new charge is compressed in the crank case. Further downward movement of the piston uncovers first the exhaust port and then the transfer port. The burnt gases escape through the exhaust port. As soon as the transfer port opens, the compressed charge from the crankcase flows into the cylinder. The charge is deflected upwards by the pump provided on the head of the piston and pushes out most of the exhaust gases. It may be noted that the incoming air-petrol mixture helps the removal of burnt gases from the engine cylinder, which is called as the scavenging process. If in case these exhaust gases do not leave the cylinder, the fresh charge gets diluted and efficiency of the engine will decrease. The cycle of events is then repeated.
2 Stroke Diesel Engine-
In a two stroke cycle diesel engine, only air is compressed inside the cylinder and the diesel is injected by an injector. There is no spark plug in this engine. The remaining operations of the two stroke cycle diesel engine are exactly the same as those of the two stroke cycle petrol engine. Its two strokes are described as follows:
Upward Stroke: During the upward stroke, the piston moves from bottom dead centre to top dead centre, compressing the air in the cylinder. The cylinder is connected to a closed crank chamber. Due to upward movement of the piston, a partial vacuum is created in the crankcase, and a new charge is drawn into the crankcase through the uncovered inlet port. The exhaust port and transfer port are covered when the piston is at the top dead centre position. The compressed charge is mixed with the injected diesel and gets auto-ignited in the combustion chamber because of the high pressure and temperature present.
Downward Stroke: As soon as the fuel is ignited, the hot gases force the piston to move downwards, rotating the crankshaft, thus doing the useful work. During this stroke the inlet port is covered by the piston and the new charge is compressed in the crank case. Further downward movement of the piston uncovers first the exhaust port and then the transfer port. The burnt gases escape through the exhaust port. As soon as the transfer port opens, the compressed charge from the crankcase flows into the cylinder. The charge is deflected upwards by the pump provided on the head of the piston and pushes out most of the exhaust gases. It may be noted that the incoming air helps the removal of burnt gases from the engine cylinder, which is called as scavenging process. If in case these exhaust gases do not leave the cylinder, the fresh charge gets diluted and efficiency of the engine will decrease. The cycle of events is then repeated."
9e90bf7f,What is some real life experience of a brain stroke? What were the symptoms prior to the stroke? Were there symptoms weeks/days before the stroke? Was there any mini stroke before the major stroke?,"First of all, ‘brain stroke’ is a silly term. All strokes occur in the brain.
Prior to my strokes, I was brilliant. I was a master’s student at Caltech and had just moved to Colorado, where our little town with no traffic lights far exceeded life in the perpetual parking lot of Los Angeles. I hiked all around the Front Range with my beloved dog, Chaco, and our new puppy, Bonzo. Life was GOOD.
One Friday in September, I flew back from Seattle — my first business trip. When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things. (I emailed a close friend that “I’d like to meet you at the pizza place, but it burned down.” Which was fine except that the pizza restaurant I had been referencing hadn’t, indeed, burned down, but was simply closed for a week. Oops.)
That was my “zeroth” stroke. I call it that because the symptoms resolved themselves within about a week and weren’t particularly severe AND to pester a particularly annoying doctor I once visited who told me “What do you mean by zeroth stroke? That makes no sense. Please call them stroke #1, #2, and #3.” I thought my nomenclature was pretty clever. ;)
Two weeks later, I was sitting in my office down in Boulder when my arm became paralyzed. Then it kind of resolved before returning to dead weight. When my foot followed suit, I called the lady across the hall for some help. She called another coworker of mine, who called the nurse, who said in no uncertain terms to call 9–1–1. I got a nice ride to the hospital from some friendly EMS personnel.
That was stroke #2. My stay at Casa Hospital lasted two nights, after which I was discharged with orders to attend PT (because, though I could walk, it wasn’t real smooth yet), OT (because my hand strength was abysmal), and ST (because I was still suffering from aphasia).
Five and a half months later, I suffered a THIRD stroke, which was, in my case, ‘the kiss of death’. While my first stroke was somewhere in the back of my brain, and my second was in my right basal ganglia, my third was in my left basal ganglia. I STRONGLY urge people to avoid bilateral injuries to their brains! In my case, it made the medications I was on to keep my awake virtually useless. Picture coffee doing nothing for you except making you jittery — not improving your cognition or wakefulness or doing anything remotely useful.
In my case, I could probably have avoided the third stroke in two ways: (1) I could have gone to the doctor (whom I didn’t yet have) or ER after my first stroke or (2) I could have insisted that I be put on something stronger than aspirin after my second stroke. Cie la vie, I suppose =(
Now, 12 years later, I’ve gotten much better. Ironically, I became depressed after my third stroke, which led me to discover a medication that wakes me up called Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin is an antidepressant with few of the side effects common to SSRIs — AND, instead of making you sluggish, it’s like being on Adderall. I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now. I have a sense of “not feeling right” some days, but I can no longer say for sure, “I could have [spent a morning at the trampoline park without going home and sleeping for two days] before.”"
08748645,What happens when you pour 2-stroke oil into a 4-stroke vehicle?,"If you pour 2-stroke oil into the oil fill on the 4-stroke engine, not much. It is probably a little thin and so it won’t lubricate as well as your engine manual might specify. I doubt you would notice for 1 oil change. If you keep doing it, you are likely under-lubricating the engine and that will increase wear.
If you pour 2-stroke oil into the gas tank, not much. You will get lots of smoke, some rough running, and eventually you will foul the spark plugs. If you do it once, I would say it is not a big deal. If you do it regularly, you can expect to wear out the plugs and possibly the exhaust system."
5b727eea,Emergency Medicine: How are stroke patients treated?,"Treatment
Emergency treatment for stroke depends on whether you're having an ischemic stroke blocking an artery — the most common kind — or a hemorrhagic stroke that involves bleeding into the brain.
Ischemic stroke
To treat an ischemic
stroke
, doctors must quickly restore blood flow to your brain.
Emergency treatment with medications. Therapy with clot-busting drugs must start within 4.5 hours if they are given into the vein — and the sooner, the better. Quick treatment not only improves your chances of survival but also may reduce complications. You may be given:
Intravenous injection of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This injection of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), also called alteplase, is considered the gold standard treatment for ischemic stroke. An injection of tPA is usually given through a vein in the arm. This potent clot-busting drug ideally is given within three hours. In some instances, tPA can be given up to 4.5 hours after stroke symptoms begin.This drug restores blood flow by dissolving the blood clot causing your stroke, and it may help people who have had strokes recover more fully. Your doctor will consider certain risks, such as potential bleeding in the brain, to determine if tPA is appropriate for you.
Emergency endovascular procedures. Doctors sometimes treat ischemic strokes with procedures performed directly inside the blocked blood vessel. These procedures must be performed as soon as possible, depending on features of the blood clot:
Medications delivered directly to the brain. Doctors may insert a long, thin tube (catheter) through an artery in your groin and thread it to your brain to deliver tPA directly into the area where the stroke is occurring. This is called intra-arterial thrombolysis. The time window for this treatment is somewhat longer than for intravenous tPA, but is still limited.
Removing the clot with a stent retriever. Doctors may use a catheter to maneuver a device into the blocked blood vessel in your brain and trap and remove the clot. This procedure is particularly beneficial for people with large clots that can't be completely dissolved with tPA, though this procedure is often performed in combination with intravenous tPA.
Several large and recent studies suggest that, depending on the location of the clot and other factors, endovascular therapy might be the most effective treatment. Endovascular therapy has been shown to significantly improve outcomes and reduce long-term disability after ischemic stroke.
Other procedures. To decrease your risk of having another stroke or transient ischemic attack, your doctor may recommend a procedure to open up an artery that's narrowed by plaque. Doctors sometimes recommend the following procedures to prevent a stroke. Options will vary depending on your situation:
Carotid endarterectomy. In a carotid endarterectomy, a surgeon removes plaques from arteries that run along each side of your neck to your brain (carotid arteries). In this procedure, your surgeon makes an incision along the front of your neck, opens your carotid artery and removes plaque that blocks the carotid artery.Your surgeon then repairs the artery with stitches or a patch made from a vein or artificial material (graft). The procedure may reduce your risk of ischemic stroke. However, a carotid endarterectomy also involves risks, especially for people with heart disease or other medical conditions.
Angioplasty and stents. In an angioplasty, a surgeon usually accesses your carotid arteries through an artery in your groin. Here, your surgeon can gently and safely navigate to the carotid arteries in your neck. A balloon is then inflated to expand the narrowed artery. Then a stent can be inserted to support the opened artery.
Hemorrhagic stroke
Emergency treatment of hemorrhagic stroke focuses on controlling your bleeding and reducing pressure in your brain. You might also need surgery to help reduce future risk.
Emergency measures. If you take warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) or anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel (Plavix) to prevent blood clots, you may be given drugs or transfusions of blood products to counteract the blood thinners' effects. You may also be given drugs to lower pressure in your brain (intracranial pressure), lower your blood pressure, prevent vasospasm or prevent seizures.
Once the bleeding in your brain stops, treatment usually involves supportive medical care while your body absorbs the blood. Healing is similar to what happens while a bad bruise goes away. If the area of bleeding is large, your doctor may perform surgery to remove the blood and relieve pressure on your brain.
Surgical blood vessel repair. Surgery may be used to repair blood vessel abnormalities associated with hemorrhagic strokes. Your doctor may recommend one of these procedures after a stroke or if an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or other type of vascular malformation caused your hemorrhagic stroke:
Surgical clipping. A surgeon places a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm, to stop blood flow to it. This clamp can keep the aneurysm from bursting, or it can prevent re-bleeding of an aneurysm that has recently hemorrhaged.
Coiling (endovascular embolization). A surgeon inserts a catheter into an artery in your groin and guides it to your brain using X-ray imaging. Tiny detachable coils are guided into the aneurysm (aneurysm coiling). The coils fill the aneurysm, which blocks blood flow into the aneurysm and causes the blood to clot.
Surgical AVM removal. Surgeons may remove a smaller AVM if it's located in an accessible area of your brain, to eliminate the risk of rupture and lower the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. However, it's not always possible to remove an AVM if its removal would cause too large a reduction in brain function, or if it's large or located deep within your brain.
Stereotactic radiosurgery. Using multiple beams of highly focused radiation, stereotactic radiosurgery is an advanced minimally invasive treatment used to repair vascular malformations."
afd59169,Why don't we have 3 stroke engine?,"Yes we have three strike engine.A Variable cycle three-stroke engine is a type of internal combustion engine, patented by Michael A. V. Ward, US patent 5454352 dated Oct 3, 1995. Although the engine runs on the four-stroke cycle, the cycle is completed in one revolution of the crankshaft, as in the Atkinson cycle engine. However, this is achieved by the use of an elliptical cam instead of the jointed linkage used in the Atkinson engine.The three stroke engine does not exist in reality but according to the patent this cycle can be termed as 3 stroke. In real it is a 2 stroke engine. The term ""three-stroke"" indicates that, to quote from the patent, ""total cycle displacement (of) the engine equals approximately three expansion ratios.
A virtual three-stroke engine with intake and compression strokes approximately one half of the power stroke of approximately 12 to one expansion ratio and with total firing cycle stroke lengths equal to approximately three expansion strokes to minimize engine throttling and frictional losses over the real world drive cycle and provide high torque from a one-to-one drive shaft RPM to engine firing cycle RPM provided by a cam type driver for controlling the piston motions and extracting the power from the piston."
628de02b,What is meant by the stroke of an engine?,"The stroke of an engine means the completion of the piston movement in cylinder from TDC (top dead centre) to BDC(BOTTOM DEAD CENTRE) of cylinder……
Stroke also means the distance travelled by the piston

Four stroke internal combustion:
In this their are in all 4 strokes completed by the piston
SUCTION: Fuel is taken inside the cylinder Piston moves down.
COMPRESSION: Piston Moves up and compresses the fuel inside the cylinder.
POWER: Here spark plug gives a spark inside the cylimder and the blast of fuel takes the piston down.
EXHAUST: Piston Moves up and let the smoke or the gas from burnt fuel out from outlet.
Two stroke internal combustion: Here the cycle is completed by only 2 strokes the up and down movement of the Piston.
It is not the complete Defination of strokes.
It is just a simple explanation.

0574f8e4,Is there any cure for a brain stroke?,"Each year, 795,000 people in the United States experience a symptomatic stroke. An estimated 6,600,000 Americans adults have had a symptomatic stroke, with a prevalence that increases with age, and 13,000,000 people in the United States have had a silent stroke that while clinically inapparent at onset might nonetheless impact long-term function. The mean survival after stroke is 6 to 7 years, with approximately 85% of patients living past the first year of stroke. Thus, the majority of patients with stroke survive the acute episode and live with enduring disability for years to come.[1]
In fact, at the onset of the brain attack, the body begins a healing process, to the affected area and others within the brain. Intervention, in this case, is essential as early as possible. By working with the patient to “relearn” some aspects, it accelerates this repair.

Stroke
There is hope to deal with brain strokes, the after-effects and risk of damage due to silent strokes.
Some people have strokes without realizing it. They're called silent strokes, and they either have no easy-to-recognize symptoms, or you don't remember them. But they do cause permanent damage in your brain.
If you've had more than one silent stroke, you may have thinking and memory problems. They can also lead to more severe strokes. [2] The only way to confirm a silent stroke is by observation and, further studies are done through sophisticated imaging.

3af105a7,Do people fully recover from a stroke?,"Speaking as someone who has had one, I can say that is possible, although the extent of the stroke is probably unique to the individual and largely depends on what areas of the brain are affected and how the brain is able to ‘reroute’ past the damaged areas.
With loss of motor control, some alleviation may be possible by moving limbs in a recognised way, mimicking walking for example or raising one’s arm, which might help to stimulate the growth of new connections but this is not always very successful.
In my case, aphasia was the main symptom, the inability to speak, write or to regain even a partial command of my native language. However, a daily regimen of vocal exercises in front of a mirror (I always wondered what my neighbours thought of me reading aloud from ‘Winnie the Pooh’ or ‘House at Pooh Corner’ during such exercises) and the constant reference to a good thesaurus meant that I was back up to speed within, I guess, two years.
I am still dyslexic when I write (but my typing appears to be OK) and have not tried to access my foreign language abilities very much, although I can follow a performed ‘Les Fourberies de Scapin’ in the original providing that I have the text of the play in front of me.
However, the most important thing, in my view, is the support of one’s family and friends, the people who knew you from before the stroke and can offer feedback on how well you seem to them at all points in the recovery process; are you genuinely improving or is it just wishful thinking?"
45d09db7,Why aren't 2-stroke engines used in cars?,"People have already mentioned the the main problems: fuel consumption, pollution, durability, and thermal efficiency. But none of this has to be the case. A two stroke can be designed to eliminate them, but at the risk of additional cost.
In a two stroke the transfer ports and exhaust ports are open at the same time. At some engine speeds, portions of the fuel mix go straight from the transfer ports out the exhaust without being burned. This leads to high fuel consumption and the ejection of unburned hydrocarbons. A solution is to use direct injection in which fuel is injected into the cylinder only after the ports close. This drastically reduces both problems.
The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.
Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. . The use of supercharger scavenging and direct injection eliminate these issues entirely.
In addition, an oil-control ring needs to be added to the engine to stop oil leaking out the exhaust ports while the piston is close to top dead centre. There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.
The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.
I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.
So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain."
87f06c84,Is stroke linked to Alzheimer's disease?,"No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.
However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else. And what a stroke can do- besides causing dementia, itself- is speed up the damage going on in the brain when any kind of dementia is already present.
And, keep in mind it is thought Alzheimer’s is “present” but undiagnosed because it just hasn’t gotten to the point it is interfering with life, up to ten years before such interference, so that, a stroke in that ten or-so year period can make it seem it was the cause of Alzheimer’s. It likely wasn’t; it just sped up the damage.
Avoiding a stroke is one of the top five ways to avoid any dementia. Doesn’t mean no-stroke-no-dementia, just that stroke is, itself indicted in some forms of dementia."
bd12310d,How high does blood pressure have to be to increase stroke risk?,"I am Kristen Gardner. Let me share some high blood pressure tricks from Bessie Vazquez’s website: Top 8 tips that can help to lower your high blood pressure in just 9 mins. Bessie Vazquez is a famous blogger about blood pressure.
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 1: Lose weight. Being overweight means that your heart has to pump blood to a larger body mass, which makes the heart work harder. Losing weight reduces the workload. “Plus, your heart will be better able to respond to circumstances that do require more work, like exercise,” says Dr. Zusman.
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 2: Exercise. Any activity that gets your heart pumping faster and your lungs working harder is one of the best ways to lower high blood pressure. “It improves the blood vessels’ ability to open and close, which improves blood flow,” says Dr. Zusman. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 3: Reduce your stress. Chronic stress may contribute to high blood pressure. More research is needed to determine the effects of chronic stress on blood pressure. Occasional stress also can contribute to high blood pressure if you react to stress by eating unhealthy food, drinking alcohol or smoking.
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 4: Reduce sodium in your diet

69fb8300,"If the power of a two stroke engine is more than of a comparable four stroke engine, why are four stroke engines used more?","In 2 strike engine power is produced every 2 strokes or 1 revolution of the crankshaft. Whereas in 4 stroke engine Power is produced every 4 strokes or 2 revolutions of the crankshaft. So theoretically 2 stroke must produce twice the 4 stroke. But practically it is not so due to many reasons, major being the way of fuel utilization.
In 4 s there are separate valves which regulate these activities. But in 2 s there is only the port system and the fuel exchange is taking place due to the scavenging effect (fresh charge displacing the used charge).
So there is lot of fuel going waste since units method is not very efficient and precise. Also due to this mixing of charges the efficiency of combustion (which relates to more power) is very less. So incomplete combustion is taking place, leading to more poisonous by products. Nowadays with strict emission norms (BS-IV). It is difficult to maintain the norms with the emissions.
Also there is more load on the crankshaft (this is nearly 2 times because power is produced every stroke). More wear and tear of the parts. So on.
With present technology lot of improvement has been done to increase this efficiency of combustion to increase the power output(like CRDI which literally sprays 4 times during combustion, this would be difficult in 2 s as by that time exhaust valve will be open). So practically with 4s same output can be got as that of 2s with less wear and tear. So 4s is used more."

1511c351,"What is the difference between a four-stroke, and a two-stroke, diesel engine?","Same as on any IC combustion engine.
Four stroke have intake and exhaust valves that must open and close at precise points of the different strokes, and have four different phases or “strokes”, inlet stroke (piston goes down, inlet valves open, fuel mix is sucked in) compression stroke (piston goes up and compresses the fuel/air mix) explosion stroke (spark ignites the mix, piston goes down producing power) and exhaust stroke (exhaust vale opens, piston goes up and burned gas goes out). That’s one power stroke each two revolutions. The system used to open and close the valves is complex and heavy, as are the valves and cylinder head.
Four-stroke engine - Wikipedia
Two stroke engines have no valves, only holes in the cylinder wall, which the piston itself opens and closes while going up and down. A moped two stroke does the pre-compression on the crankcase, but a diesel from a railroad engine uses a air compressor to force the mix thru the intake opening. They are simpler and have a power stroke every revolution, thus being more powerful for the same displacement. Being simpler they are also lighter.
Two-stroke engine - Wikipedia

05bc3989,Why is the mechanical efficiency of a 2-strokes engine higher than a 4-stroke engine?,"""Why is the mechanical efficiency of a two stroke engine higher than a four stroke engine?""
The question asks why or which IC engine (two stroke or four stroke) is closer to being an ideal machine; that is, which comes closer to the elusive ideal of an engine's power input potential actually equaling the power output produced.
Both engines types convert heat into motion, and both are only between, say, 20%-40% thermally efficient, (with modern big diesels doing the best) with the other 60%-80% being lost as waste heat.
And the question doesn't constrain the answer with comparing two specific engines, asking only for generalities, and therefore freeing the answer to be expressed simply:
The answer is friction.
Friction converts motion into heat, hence friction removes motion. (efficiency)
A two stroke engine has a power stroke with every crank revolution, while a four stroke only has a power stroke with every two crank revolutions, meaning the two stroke basically has half the frictional loss to overcome with each power stroke, compared to that of the four stroke, and this frictional loss is compounded by the more complex design of the four stroke engine, which has many, many more internal parts to keep in motion (more work and, consequently, more frictional losses) than that of the much simpler design of the two stroke engine.
But that said, lack of positive environmental efficiency is the Achilles Heal of the two stroke engine, and the main reason for its current status."
3dd1926b,Where do cats like to be petted?,"There are way too many variations between one cat and another to be precise, it also depends on how well you and the cat know one another. A matter of trust is involved.
But as a general rule with all cats under all circumstances, first check the tail. if it is still then a cautious tickle can be tried behind the ear, and depending on how that is received you can take it from there - always watching the tail, if it starts wagging you have gone too far.
The basic rule of thumb is to concentrate on the spots that are the hardest for the cat to reach when grooming herself. So cheeks, top of head, behind ears, under chin are all universal sweet spots, once purring starts, you can experiment a little while always noting the tail. Except for it shooting straight up on stroking, (Nice) any movement of the tail is an advance warning that whatever you just did was not welcomed. (Not nice).
This warning if disregarded, will be followed up with action.
That may be with a playful nip while holding your hand gently with her claw tips and staring at you with a “I could hurt you if I wanted to” look, to the more advanced swipe with claws and bite followed immediately with an ungraceful scrabble to get away from you, which if you are not ready, can cause severe, even if unintended, damage to any bits of you that may be exposed.
Always pay close attention to the tail. It will save a lot of bloodshed and be the facilitator of a closer and more trusting relationship with your cat if kept immobile.
Note: I have currently two cats both Siamese. One loves having her tummy tickled and would let you do it all day while she floats dreamily on. The other would attempt to amputate your hand if it got within an inch or two of her tummy, a fiercely wagged tail and growling warns you off, but subsides immediately and returns to purrs if attention is returned to her ears and chin.
Other than that, they are quite the same so never take anything for granted with a cat.
If you are still here and want some more pearls, then read on…
While you are making friends with a cat, you should avoid sudden movements as it makes them nervous. Once a level of trust is established you can do as you like but the trust must be there first.
If your cat settles on your lap or close by, but in contact, (maybe a head resting on your hand or just touching) note which way they lay especially when sleeping. If they are facing you, it may look nice and friendly, but in reality it is because they don’t trust you and are keeping a wary eye out. If they face away from you, it is not a sign of disrespect, but that they trust you enough to risk turning their back to keep a look out for exterior risks instead. You are now officially a friend and have earned a measure of trust.
You can start to play some games now, chasing a bit of string is a good starter, it will illustrate how far along the friendship has progressed. If she catches the string and starts giving it some tooth and claw treatment, does it stop with the string or continue on to your hand with equal vigour?
If she continues the savaging on to you, then she isn’t paying enough attention to what she is doing because she doesn’t care, but if the savaging stops with the string, then she recognises you as a friend and doesn’t want to hurt you.

Paying attention to little things like this will help a friendship with a cat along quite a bit, but as naturally solitary animals only time will cement a true deep and meaningful relationship. Try to avoid startling your cat, unpleasant surprises don’t do anything to built trust, they do like to be able to settle into stable unmoving environments where they don’t get surprised - play excepted, where if in the mood, anything goes - cats love a quiet predictable lifestyle, and will love you for it all the more if they can predict how you will act and be judged non-threatening to them."
54a4327d,What is a 2-stroke engine?,"A 2-stroke engine is an engine in which there are 2 phases in a cycle of operation of the engine. Stroke basically, means the sudden movement of piston which is converted into a rotary motion at crankshaft. This rotation is coupled to gear system and differential, which turns the wheel.
The engine contains 3 openings as shown- Inlet, Exit and Transfer ports
There are basically 4 processes in a petrol/diesel engine- Introduction of fuel, Compression, Ignition and Exhaust.
In a 4 stroke engine, these 4 processes happen in 4 different strokes. Here, introduction of fuel and compression happens in the first stroke and the next 2 processes in the other.
1. In the first stroke of piston, the piston moves from top to bottom. When the piston is at the top, inlet port is open for the fuel to enter. The piston descends and blocks the inlet port and its further descent pushes the air-fuel mixture into transfer port.
2. Now, the piston moves from bottom to top. The air-fuel mixture coming out of transfer port is present in the cylinder and this is compressed by the piston, which moves upward. At this stage,
In a petrol engine, when the mixture is compressed, it is ignited by the spark plug and the mixture undergoes combustion.
In a diesel engine, the mixture is compressed to a greater pressure at which the mixture self-ignites.
The gases, produced after combustion expands and pushes the piston downwards and the CYCLE REPEATS ITSELF.
This is the working of a 2 stroke engine. Some info about this type of engine:
In each stroke, crankshaft rotates HALFWAY as opposed to a 4 stroke engine where it rotates ONE-QUARTER. Thus, for a given volume of the cylinder, a 2 stroke engine develops MORE POWER than 4 stroke engine.
The combustion is not complete and very noisy.
It consumes more amount of fuel and hence, less fuel efficient.
N.B. This is a continuous process. To start the engine, you have to initiate the first downward movement of the piston, either manually(by kicking the lever) or electronically, by use of motor(power start)."
86dfe511,What is the easiest swimming stroke to learn for beginners?,"First, “Free-style” is not a swimming stroke. It’s a competative event permitting the use of a variety of strokes.
The easiest stroke for a complete beginner to learn will depend on body density (float-ability)
If someone can float easily on their back, the “Elementary Backstroke” is exceedingly easy to learn, and requires very little coordination to be effective. The only real concern for new swimmers is being able to tolerate water occasionally sloshing over their face and nose.
If floating on their back is difficult for a new swimmer, the “Breaststroke” is typically easy to learn because the arm motion at least, is a fairly natural motion. However, it takes a fair amount of practice to develop the coordination to make this stroke effective.
“Sidestroke” is perhaps a touch more difficult to learn than “Breaststroke”, but once someone has nailed the correct movements, it’s not complicated at all to perform the stroke with reasonable efficiency."
aac1288a,How does a 4-stroke engine work?,"To start off there are a few terms you should know:
Inlet valve
Exhaust valve
Piston
Connecting Rod
Crank shaft
Spark plug
1.) Valves: These can be opened and closed to facilitate the movement of the air and fuel mixture throughout inside the engine cylinder
2.) Piston: a short cylinder fitting closely within a tube in which it moves up and down against a liquid or gas, it’s basic function is to impart motion.
3.) Connecting rod: A mechanical part that connects the piston to the crank shaft.
4.) Spark plug : It is used to deliver electric current in an IC engine.
There are basically 4 parts into which the working of a four stroke engine can be divided :
Intake stroke
Compression stroke
Power stroke
Exhaust stroke
INTAKE STROKE :
In the intake stroke the air fuel mixture enter’s into the engine with the help of the inlet valve.
The piston’s position moves from the top dead centre to the bottom dead centre. (ie: top to bottom)
The exhaust valve remains closed in this stroke.
COMPRESSION STROKE :
In this stroke the piston moves from the bottom dead centre to the top dead centre. (ie: bottom to top)
The air-fuel mixture drawn in during the intake stroke is pressurised by the piston. The value of the pressure in the system rises to a value of about 8 bar.
Just before the end of this stroke the operating plug initiates a spark which ignites the mixture and combustion takes place inside the engine cylinder.
Both the inlet and exhaust valve remain closed during the operation of this stroke
POWER STROKE :
When combustion takes place, gasses are produced in the engine, these gasses again force the piston to move from the top dead centre to the bottom dead centre.
The power generated during this movement is obtained as work
Both valves remain closed at the start of this stroke but as the piston moves to the top dead centre, the exhaust valve starts opening.
EXHAUST STROKE :
After combustion the gasses that are collected inside the engine cylinder become useless.
These gasses are made to escape through the exhaust valve in the engine.
The movement of the piston is from the bottom dead centre to the top dead centre in this stroke, finally reaching the same position as it was at the beginning of the 4 stroke cycle.
The inlet valve remains closed during this stroke"

The WW2 American submarines all use Fairbanks Morse opposed piston two stroke diesels in their submarines. And modern US nuclear subs also have one for auxilliary power if they have to completely shut down the nuclear plant.
The Doxford marine engine is a moving cylinder head uniflow 2 stroke diesel of up to about 7,000 kw power.
The Junkers Jumo aircraft engine of the 1930s was an opposed piston 2 stroke diesel.
The British Deltic diesel - 18 cylinders and 36 pistons in a triangular layout powered trains in the UK for many years.
And the Commer Knocker engine. Three horizontal cylinders with 6 pistons and a single crankshaft connected by heavy rocker arms to the pistons. A large Rootes blower provides the scavenging. A very noisy engine when running, hence its name.

589a207a,What happens if I mix petrol with oil in 4 stroke engine?,"Well mixing with oil in petrol can cause major problem.. but if ratio is good thn everything is better. I have my royal Enfield motor bike ;i mix 30ml of oil in 1 liter of petrol. Engine gets smooth. And it's runs very smoothly you can feel it when u add it. Adding oil in petrol in tank have another advantage.. as inside the tank it doesn't get rusted… if you want to check whether your oil mixing ratio is proper, just remove spark plug check for carbon deposit. If it's too black or some heavy carbon deposit. Make ratio of oil from 30ml to 20ml or even low depend upon engine cc.
Please note -
It's for royal Enfield Himalaya bike BS3 model
Not recommend for fuel injectors bike (BS4)"
14daaa18,Why do people that suffer from migraines have a higher risk of stroke?,"Yes it can. There are several migraine types that can—one reporter on TV, in fact, about a year ago, had a migraine attack on screen and they thought she had a stroke. It is very common.
To test if it is a stroke or migraine is hard because if you have hemiplegic, one side of your body will go off-line and tests for stroke will show stroke even if that’s not what you have. It is best to get into the hospital for a doctor’s examination to see if it is a stroke or migraine.
Migraine is an electrolyte imbalance caused by the over-activity of the sensory neurons. In a migraineur’s brain, the sensory neurons have much more connections than the same neurons in a typical non-migraine brain. This is why migraineurs tend to be overstimulated by strong bright lights, strong odors, loud sounds, more sensitive to touch, and some (like me) also are super-tasters, so more sensitive to spices.
Because of the hyper-reaction of the brain to sensory stimulus, it generates more voltage—voltage is communication in the brain—and that extra voltage uses more sodium. Migraineurs need more salt in their diet to counter this effect. A study showed that migraineurs lose over 50% more sodium in their urine than non-migraineurs—eating the same thing.
Migraineurs are also glucose sensitive (carbs intolerant) because glucose removes sodium and water from cells—therefore, carbs reduce brain sodium even more for migraineurs, causing a migraine.

a67fc978,Is there any way to detect a stroke or heart attack earlier?,"Strokes and heart attacks are two entirely different events. I will address some of the lesser known factors in getting treatment for both. This is from personal experience.
The symptoms of a heart attack vary widely in a range from a silent heart attack (with no pain), to the classic widow maker heart attack with clear striated pain running down the left side of your chest and left arm. Websites like Mayo Clinic and others will clearly define symptoms for you. Educate yourself with these symptoms, it could save your life.
A heart attack is “usually” is most commonly caused by an artery blockage which shuts off the blood supply to a section of your heart which results in killing the tissue in that part of the heart and causes scar tissue. Symptoms the person feels may change depending on where the blockage is located. What is not talked about much is that survival rates for females heart attacks are much lower than men. This lower survival rate is due to the “typical” female heart being smaller than the “typical” male heart. Thus, the smaller heart is less able to withstand the rigors of the attack. So, earlier detection and preventative measures are especially important to females.
For earlier detection, the health provider can use several means including performing an angiogram a procedure which uses radioactive dye and associated imaging to locate the blockage(s).
Blockages may potentially be resolved by stent placement which is least invasive or open heart surgery. The stent placement is performed by a surgeon who is sometimes referred to as an “interventionist”. This is a relatively common procedure. Open heart surgery is much more involved and I will not go into the details here.
For a stent placement, it is important to get the very BEST interventionist working on you as these procedures require skill and experience. If given a choice of a well known, acclaimed heart clinics like Methodist Debakey or St. Luke’s in Houston, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, or Duke in NC go there by all means. Not only do they have top skill levels available there, they have a deep POOL of highly qualified interventionists available. A smaller hospital might have one or two very qualified interventionists, but what happens if the INTERVENTIONIST you need for a heart attack THAT DAY is on vacation or out sick? Poor skills or unanticipated complications can lead to a situation where the only interventionist available in a smaller institution backs out of the procedure (this happened with my mother) or else continues to the point where a rupture of the blocked blood vessel occurs (this happened with a friend of mine). In such a rupture they will have to perform open heart surgery to save you. So, the skill level of the interventionist is key. It is better to have one who is better experienced in the many possibilities they will encounter and that they are equipped to work around these issues.
DO NOT DRIVE YOURSELF to the emergency room! If you do you will lose many advantages that exist with arrival via EMS and you could find yourself too ill to drive, stuck in a traffic tie up or even faint on the way. DON’T DO IT! If you are having a heart attack it is imperative to get the EMS to where you are fast. Do not lay down while you wait. Sit in a comfortable chair. This assists your failing heart by keeping a little pressure on your vascular system. While you wait on the EMS be sure to take half a dozen aspirin to thin the blood. Tell the EMS how many aspirin you took. The EMS will also give you morphine to increase blood flow to the heart muscle which will aid in reducing the damage. On the way to the hospital the EMS will clear traffic with their flashing lights and be sending your vital signs to the hospital via telemetry. They will be alerting the on duty interventionist that you are on the way and to be ready to take action. They will be your passport STRAIGHT PAST check in and onto the operating table, hopefully with the interventionist and staff there waiting for your arrival. So time spent getting the EMS is not time wasted. It is time saved. Time saved is heart tissue saved!
Strokes are blockages of blood supply to a section of your brain. This could lead to paralysis on one side of your face or body, slurring of speech and loss of control of your hands, arms, legs, etc. Impacts from stroke can be permanent or temporary. If temporary, it is called a TIA, a transient ischemic attack and may only last a few seconds after which full functioning of the body will return. A stroke is more serious and extremely disconcerting to the victim and sometimes accompanied by confusion or denial. That is, the victim minimizes the problem and does not seek IMMEDIATE emergency treatment which is paramount to regaining use of the paralyzed functions. I know stroke treatment technology has improved in the past few years, but it used to be the case that if the blockage is cleared in less than 15 minutes, permanent brain damage could be reduced or eliminated. Medical technology has been created to defeat the blockage. Take advantage of it. Time is of the essence. Don’t delay!
In cases of heart attack and stroke have a plan prepared in advance. If your family history indicates possibility of heart attack or stroke make a plan! Share the plan with your family or spouse."
c40785a1,How does a brain stroke happen?,To put it as simply as possible there are two types of stroke namely ischemic and haemorrhagic...any factor that causes decreased blood supply to a particular area of the brain leads to ischemic stroke and symptoms pertaining to that particular region of the brain..any factor that increases the pressure of the blood flow through a particular vessel in the brain leads to rupture of the small vessel and causes haemorrhagic stroke...ischemic stroke most commonly caused due to an emboli blocking an end artery...while haemorrhagic stroke is most commonly caused due to uncontrolled hypertension..
664bf247,Why six stroke engines cannot be used in vehicles?,"There are a variety of engine cycles called “six-stroke engines ,” of which the Dyer/Crower engine is the best known, and thus the one which I’ll assume you’re asking about.
The first four strokes are the same as in an Otto or Diesel cycle. After the fourth stroke, liquid water is injected to make high pressure steam, which is expanded (fifth stroke) to make mechanical power and low pressure steam, and the low pressure steam is then exhausted (sixth stroke).
The first problem is thermal stress: the surface of the piston and the inside of the cylinder heat up and cool down more quickly than in a normal four stroke engine. Exotic materials (ceramics?) might be needed for such an engine to last a long time.
The second is water.
If there is no condenser to turn exhausted steam back to liquid, then you’ll need a tank of water, which will probably be used at about the same rate as gasoline. Even if you didn’t mind having this tank, filling it could be a problem. Even if the engine can use tap water, you’ll need to fill it every time you get gas… there’s no convenient water dispenser next to the fuel pump. Did I mention that Bruce Crower didn’t even attempt to use tap water, and only tried running his engine with distilled water? Distilled water isn’t very expensive, but it’s not something presently available at gas stations.
If there is a condenser, you won’t need to fill the water tank nearly so often, but this component could be heavy.
A third problem is balancing to minimize vibration — the only good arrangement that comes to mind is an inline 6 cylinder engine with 3 pistons going up together and the other three going down together.
A fourth possible problem is that, if a combined air exhaust/steam exhaust is used, then the steam will dilute the air exhaust, throw of the O2 sensors, and interfere with the working of the catalytic converter. Using separate exhaust systems can solve that, but will make your engine look like a mutant octopus, since there will be three manifolds (intake air, exhaust air, steam).
A fifth problem, related to the first, is that high temperature high pressure steam, even without the assistance of oxygen, can degrade a variety of materials.
The final problem is that it is new and strange, and the auto industry doesn’t like radical change."
4aead36d,What do you do when someone is having a stroke?,"3 Things to Do When Someone Is Having a Stroke:
1. Call 911 immediately
If you do nothing else, act quickly to call 911.
“The hardest thing you have to do is recognize symptoms of a stroke,” Jean explains. “If you do observe any symptoms, you should call 911 immediately. You should also immediately tell the 911 dispatcher, ‘I think I’m having a stroke’ or ‘I think my loved one is.’”
Not sure what the symptoms of a stroke are? Give someone you think is having a stroke this FAST test
from the National Stroke Association.
2. Note the time you first see symptoms
A clot-busting medication called tPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, can be given to someone if they’re having a stroke, potentially reversing or stopping symptoms from developing. But it has to be given within 4.5 hours of the start of symptoms, Jean says.
Patients may also be candidates for more advanced therapies, such as endovascular treatments, at Penn Medicine. Endovascular treatments can involve surgically removing a clot that caused a stroke, or fixing an aneurysm—which is a swollen blood vessel that bursts and causes pressure in the brain. Endovascular treatments for ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke, must be administered within 24 hours of symptom onset, and earlier treatment improves outcome so time is critically important.
“If a witness sees someone having a stroke, it would be helpful if they look at what time the symptoms started,” she says. “That way, the emergency staff can make a more informed decision about treatment options.”
3. Perform CPR, if necessary
Most stroke patients don’t require CPR, Jean notes. But if your friend or spouse is unconscious when you find her, check her pulse and breathing. If you find none, call 911 and start CPR while you’re waiting for the ambulance to arrive.
You can also ask the 911 dispatcher to walk you through how to perform CPR, which consists of repeated, steady chest compressions, according to the American Heart Association
(OR)
1. Let that person go to sleep or talk you out of calling 911
Stroke survivors often complain of suddenly feeling very sleepy when a stroke first happens.
“A lot of patients come in and say they went to sleep for a few hours before they came to the hospital because they were tired,” Jean notes.
But time is of the essence. “The medication we can give a stroke survivor is time-sensitive,” she adds. “They should not go to sleep, and they should not call their primary care doctor 2 days from now. Instead, they should just go immediately to the emergency room.”
And no matter how much someone might try to talk you out of taking them to the hospital, don’t let them, says Jean.
2. Give them medication, food, or drinks
There are 2 kinds of strokes:
Hemorrhagic stroke, caused by a ruptured blood vessel
Ischemic stroke, caused by a clot in a blood vessel
“80% of strokes are ischemic ones, but if you’re in that 20% and your stroke was caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the head, you don’t want the victim to have aspirin,” Jean says. “And you can’t tell which one it is until you get to the emergency room and you get a CAT scan.”
To be safe, don’t give someone who has a stroke any medication.
You also shouldn’t give him food or drinks before the ambulance comes. “Sometimes, a stroke affects their ability to swallow,” Jean says.
3. Drive yourself or someone else to the emergency room
It might seem like a good idea to drive a stroke victim to the nearest emergency room. But Jean says, “If someone is severely affected by a stroke, then you’re better off calling 911.”
Emergency responders can start life-saving treatment for that person on the way to the emergency room, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says.
You also don’t want to drive yourself to a hospital in the event that your stroke symptoms worsen and impair your ability to drive safely."
89e0b607,Why is oil used along with petrol in 2 stroke engine bikes?,"First of oil, most modern and old 2 stroke motorcycle engines have a separate oil tank that pumps special 2 stroke oil to the crankshaft bearings and the cylinder walls to lubricate them “obviously”, it is then burned with the air/ petrol mixture that is sucked in through its crankcase and then burnt after combustion has taken place and this burnt oil is what causes 2 stroke to belch out blue smoke so effectively the oil that is pumped is total loss unlike a 4 stroke/ cycle engine where where the combustion chamber is totally oil free..a 2 stroke engine receives fresh oil on every piston stroke unlike a 4 stroke engine that has to be changed at intervals from 3 to 12 thousand miles depending on the climate of the country, however, some 2 stroke engines like chain saws have to have the oil mixed with the petrol/ gasoline before it is put into the fuel tank, most 2 stroke engines will require a new cylinder or a rebore with fresh new pistons a long way before a 4 stroke engine where the engine oil is not Total loss.🏍"
804c9520,Which produces more power 2 stroke or 4 stroke?,Two stroke gives more power than four stroke. Reason being in 2-stroke there is one power stroke for each revolution of crankshaft (1 complete cycle) and in 4-stroke engine there is one power stroke for two revolutions of crankshaft (1 complete cycle). P.s: now we cant compare a 100cc two stroke with 1200cc four stroke. Keeping the parameters same we can say that 2-stroke provides more power than 4-stroke.
9fd3dbeb,Is it possible to have a stroke while you are asleep and not know it?,"As a survivor of basilar strokes I will say in general strokes don’t pick a particular time to happen. Your physical, emotional and mental circumstance will add or take away to have it happen. A basilar stroke is probably the leading cause of those who die in their sleep. This type of stroke isn’t talked about because it would scare the general public wittless! It kills 97% per event. I had three of them in the same week. I know this because I didn’t sleep well the night before I went to the Urgent Care. If I had slept? I more than likely I would not be responding to this answer. I was finally given an answer of what was my survivability percentage. I am a .01% survivor. If I had not gone to the hospital, and had all the wonderful medical teams? This very answer would not be on Quora."

Vitamin E
Take 400 IU daily of a mixed complex. It prevents cholesterol oxidation and is a natural blood thinner.
Policosanol
Take 10 to 20 mg each evening. Numerous studies show that policosanol reduces LDL cholesterol and increases the good HDL cholesterol.
Pantetheine
Pantetheine is a metabolite of vitamin B5 that has been shown in studies to reduce total and LDL cholesterol. as well to increase HDL. lt can be effective particularly for people with diabetes. Take 600 to 900 mg daily.
Soy protein
Soy protein has been shown in studies to reduce total and LDL cholesterol and to increase HDL. Take 25 to 50 grams daily.
Reishi
Reishi is a mushroom extract that reduces cholesterol. Take 800 mg two to three times daily.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
In a 2003 study, scientists discovered that eating fish several times per week reduces risk of thrombotic stroke (a type of ischemic stroke that occurs when a blood clot forms in arteries in the neck or brain). An earlier study also found that high consumption of fish and omega-3 fatty acids may be linked to decreased risk of thrombotic stroke.
Calcium
Calcium is very important in rectifying all circulatory diseases and disorders including stroke. Because calcium is the most alkaline mineral in the mineral family, it helps to counteract acidity and bust up accumulated debris that stick to the arterial walls and thus open up clogged and obstructed arteries. Natural calcium-rich herbs include: Comfrey Root, Oatstraw, Horsetail, and Alfalfa.
Other beneficial herbs for stroke prevention and remedy include: Cayenne, Ginger, Cinnamon, Butcher’s Broom, Gotu Kola, Cranesbill, Goldenseal Root, Manjistha, Holy (Blessed) Thistle, Gingko Biloba, and Mullein Leaf."
2493622d,Is scooty a four stroke or two stroke ?,"2 stroke not in use anymore nowadays and there is no production or sales of them since years because two stroke engines with petro-oil lubrication(oil mixing with petrol) is only banned in India and they are unable to comply with emission norms so today if any one designs a engine which does not use petro-oil lubrication and complies with new standards of emissiom then it will be allowed on road, regardless of number of strokes. Also in two strokes mechanical efficiency is higher on the other hand four stroke thermal efficiency is higher so now four stroke engine is mostly used.Two strokes engine causes more pollution with less efficiency. 4 stroke engines over 2 stroke engines be it milage, or heating issues 4 stroke are better. Also the 2 strokes are used in lawn roller, Luna, moped etc. But scooty uses 4 stroke."
e10f484b,How would you compare a 2 stroke and a 4 stroke engine?,"A 2 stroke engine doesn't have camshaft like a 4 stroke engine. Air intake and exhaust outlet are operated by ports, unlike valves in a 4 stroke engine. So a 2 stroke engine is less in weight up to 40% compared to 4 stroke engine and also there are no losses due to valve openings and closings like in 4 stroke since they don't have valves. So two stroke engines have greater power output compared to four stroke engines.

7ecf0ff4,Swimming: What is the best way to learn the butterfly stroke?,"I speak from my daughter's perspective who specialized in butterfly and had many lessons including lessons from Olympians and she made fun of Michael Phelps style (not great style but much superior strength and muscle mass compensate...he breathes every stroke).
Stay flat to the water...all up and down is wasted energy and induces drag. Literally suck the water when breathing. Don't pull your head way up to breath....it is heavy and the rest of your body will go down you get it just above the water to breathe.
It is not a stroke that can be done slowly though in great shape you can pace yourself for the longer races. For a period she attended a K-12 school and the rules allowed her to high school swim (yes she was a year round swimmer) in 6th grade. At grade 9 we were contacted by a recruiter assuming she was in 12th grade. There were a lot of rules for this call (speaker phone, both parents, etc). He was shocked that she was not a senior in high school but a freshman. He said her times would lead a D3 school, be in the middle of a D2 school and barely make a D1 school. He said he would call back in a 2 years.
Unfortunately as many competitive swimmers in butterfly do, she developed shoulder problems and quit the sport. Her coach had no dry land training to counter balance the muscles she used excessively
Here is a picture in the middle of a 200 fly event"
c5c5c96b,Can I use car motor oil in my 2 stroke in an emergency?,"Can you use motor oil in two-stroke continuously? Most likely. Can you use it in a pinch? Definitely. I use a mixture of 20w50, marine 2-stroke oil, and a little bit of fuel as a thinner to make my own two-stroke oil for my chainsaw. I’ve had no issues besides a little more smoking on startup, due to the motor oil’s higher flash point - it just doesn’t burn completely, and I tend to use more oil than I need anyway.
Now, you probably shouldn’t use plain marine two-stroke oil in something like a string trimmer or chainsaw; marine engines are water-cooled so they run cooler than air-cooled engines. Heat drops oil viscosity, which decreases the film strength of the oil. So, I add 20w50 to increase the viscosity of the oil when hot.
One thing that comes up in similar discussions is that motor oil won’t mix in gasoline. This is absolutely untrue based on both theory and my personal experience. Gasoline and motor oil are composed of organic compounds, with the oil just having longer carbon chains than the gasoline. It will probably require more mixing, but once dissolved, you won’t have multiple phases forming.
It’s probably not ideal to mix used motor oil into your fuel, even if you filter it first. Used oil contains heavy metals from the bearings, and those will end up in the two-stroke’s exhaust. It’s not good to breathe that stuff in.
As a final note, I’d like to mention that two-stroke engines have been around for a ages, way before these fancy, overpriced two-stroke oils came around. People have used motor oil for this purpose for a long time, so I think it’s just fine."

, so it may not really apply any more. Disadvantages: The roots blower was a big expensive thing. If it went south, it deposited lots of bits into the engine. The cylinder liners sometimes cracked at the intake ports. And they where loud. Nicknamed the Screaming Jimmy
for a reason.
That being said, I thought they where a clever design, and the one I drove and maintained was really old. I think it was doing pretty well all things considered, and at a fraction of he cost of an equivalent Cummins."
1d9c991a,Why do 2-stroke engines make more power than 4-strokes with the same displacement?,"The clue is that a four stroke engine requires four strokes and complicated valve gear to complete a combustion cycle, while the two stroke only requires two as has already been mentioned.
The difference is the induction and exhaust phases.
Early two stroke gasoline engines universally required a deflector top piston to direct the incoming charge away from the exhaust ports. Anyone who has worked on the old two-stroke industrial or the marine engines manufactured by Evinrude/Johnson or Mercury is familiar with this configuration.
Lack of intake and exhaust porting sophistication led to the horsepower/displacement deficit in favor of the four stroke engine, even in flat head designs, due to the more efficient control of the gas flow which led to greater fuel economy.
The East German MZ GP twin cylinder 250cc bikes of the early ‘60s demonstrated that possible sophistication. They had Schnurle porting that carefully directed the intake flow to fill the cylinder while minimizing unnecessary dilution by the combustion gases. Timing was controlled by intake disc valves and piston ports using the maximum crankcase compression possible to supercharge the intake gas flow.
Exhaust gas flow control was achieved by calculating the exhaust flow that first scavenged the cylinder then reflected a pressure wave back to the cylinder’s exhaust ports. This prevented further flow and also stopped the intake charge coming through the exhaust ports before the piston travel could close them. This was accomplished with a tuned exhaust system consisting of an initial diverging cone (like a cheerleader’s megaphone) followed by the calculated volume of a connected cylinder that ended in a converging cone evacuated by a small diameter exhaust pipe of carefully calculated diameter and length.
Without valve gear, these engines could rev a blue streak and develop previously unimaginable outputs. They also had a power and torque curve like a cliff (hence multi-multi gear transmissions), and consumed fuel at a prodigious rate commensurate with the output.
One observer noted a factory GP rider, practicing on a 50cc bike, tuck in behind a customer available factory over-the-counter 125cc club racer bike, then accelerate away when clear of the tight corner. The three cylinder engine was rumored to develop well over twenty HP from three cubic inches. My four-stroke ’61 Honda Cub developed four and a half HP from its pushrod 50cc.
These GP bikes were also using constant-loss oil injection to the mains and rods to avoid contaminating the intake charge with the usual fuel/oil mix.
Unfortunately, they still smoked and so could never pass a restrictive hydrocarbon limit. On that basis, two-strokes were banned from the track and the street.
I still remember my Kawasaki ‘70 H2. Though it was only a piston port charged engine, the porting was good and the engine was rated at sixty HP. It was a wheel-standing demon in first through third gear if you were careless, or showing off. It was still light on the front end when shifting to fourth with the standard gearing.
My ’61 Matchless G50, also 500cc, was rated at fifty HP and could loft the front wheel in first and second and unload the front fork on shifting to third. Even with short or twisty course gearing, it was always a gentle evolution unlike the explosive Kawasaki."
4101175a,Which engine is easier to crank? A 2-stroke or a 4-stroke?,"The ability of engine is dependent on its volume and compression ratio.
apparently 2 stroke CV engines are meant to be easily cranking engine compared to 4 stroke engine for the same volume and compression ratio."
9bbf2d3f,Can I use 2-stroke engine oil for a 4-stroke engine?,"No You Cant,
]1. 2T engine oils which is used for engines are of mostly single grade and are mixed with the fuel to give the lubrication to various parts and it will be burnt after lubrication.
2.But incase of the four stroke the oil will be stored in an sump and will be pumped to various parts to give lubrication.
Viscosity,Flash point of the oil,viscosity index Density are all the important factors for the lubricating oil.
When we take operating conditions of the 4T engines especially the SI engines the temperature will be of high during operation. So in order to withstand these conditions the oil should have high viscosity at certain temperatures and high flash point.
Below is the property of an 2T engine oil
And Below is the properties of an well known 4T engine oil.
So here when we compare flash point of both oils the 2T oils have low flash point and as well as the viscosity at elevated temperatures.
It shows that 2T engine oil will not withstand temperature above 135 degree celsius. And the viscoity is also less. So it cannot be used in the 4T engine oils"
a8b4790f,How does a four-stroke diesel engine work?,"Diesel engine which is also known as compression ignition engine is widely used in automobile industries. Many big vehicles such as truck, bus, car etc. used diesel engine as the power unit because of its higher torque and greater mileage than petrol engine. Diesel engine is very popular in Indian market as well as in other countries because of lower price of diesel than petrol in many countries. So the requirement of diesel engine is much more than petrol engine.
The ignition temperature of diesel is lower than petrol so the working of diesel engine is slightly different than petrol engine.
Working of Four Stroke Diesel Engine
The power generation process in four stroke diesel engine is also divided into four parts. Each part is known as piston stroke. In IC engine, stroke is referred to the maximum distance travel by the piston in a single direction. The piston is free to move only in upward and downward direction. In four stroke engine the piston move two time up and down and the crankshaft move two complete revolution to complete four piston cycle. These are suction stroke, compression stroke, expansion stroke and exhaust stroke.
Suction stroke:
In the suction stroke or intake stroke of diesel engine the piston start moves from top end of the cylinder to bottom end of the cylinder and simultaneously inlet valve opens. At this time air at atmospheric pressure drawn inside the cylinder through the inlet valve by a pump. The inlet valve remains open until the piston reaches the lower end of cylinder. After it inlet valve close and seal the upper end of the cylinder.
Compression stroke:
After the piston passes bottom end of the cylinder, it starts moving up. Both valves are closed and the cylinder is sealed at that time. The piston moves upward. This movement of piston compresses the air into a small space between the top of the piston and cylinder head. The air is compressed into 1/22 or less of its original volume. Due to this compression a high pressure and temperature generate inside the cylinder. Both the inlet and exhaust valves do not open during any part of this stroke. At the end of compression stroke the piston is at top end of the cylinder.
Power stroke:
At the end of the compression stroke when the piston is at top end of the cylinder a metered quantity of diesel is injected into the cylinder by the injector. The heat of compressed air ignites the diesel fuel and generates high pressure which pushes down the piston. The connection rod carries this force to the crankshaft which turns to move the vehicle. At the end of power stroke the piston reach the bottom end of cylinder.
Exhaust stroke:
When the piston reaches the bottom end of cylinder after the power stroke, the exhaust valve opens. At this time the burn gases inside the cylinder so the cylinder pressure is slightly high from atmospheric pressure. This pressure difference allows burn gases to escape through the exhaust port and the piston move through the top end of the cylinder. At the end of exhaust all burn gases escape and exhaust valve closed. Now again intake valve open and this process running until your vehicle starts."
656e4d86,"What are your thoughts on Stephen Miller expressing outrage at Biden for suspending “pages of immigration law with the stroke of a pen,” which had been enacted by the stroke of a pen (Sharpie)?","I love it.
If Stephen Miller had hitched his wagon to a man who was smart, liked to work, and wanted to learn new things, we would be in deep doo-doo. Such a man would’ve rammed through immigration laws in a compliant Congress, as the GOP had control of both houses of the legislature from 2017 to 2019. Trump also had GOP congresspeople running scared, so he could’ve definitely rammed through whatever he wanted with regards to immigration.
Laws passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President, as we all know, are much harder to dislodge or overturn by subsequent presidential administrations and Congresses. That’s why people with government experience concentrate almost exclusively on passing laws.
Thankfully for us, Stephen Miller got Donald Trump, the laziest, most dense mofo this side of “Idiocracy.”
Trump didn’t care to fix the immigration system in the way his followers wanted him to. That would’ve required hard work and, you know, learning how the government actually worked. So Trump, like has been his wont his whole life, did two things: 1) he made a lot of noise that he was “the busiest president ever!” and 2) found the easiest way to change policies that would least disturb his habits—which included watching hours upon hours upon hours of TV, tweeting about those hours of TV, and then yapping with his friends on the phone hatching elaborate revenge schemes against those who had crossed him. (Otherwise known as “executive time.”) And when he got tired of his “executive time,” he golfed. There was also a tremendous amount of golfing. So the easiest way that Trump found to unilaterally and lazily pass policy changes that he liked and that required the least amount of consultation and horse-trading with others (i.e. less work)—executive orders.
Now the Trumpists are quickly finding out that electing a highly entertaining, incurious, lazy fat-ass for president does have its downsides—like all of Trump’s policies being rescinded unilaterally by Biden within a few months. Biden, like Trump, doesn’t even have to bother asking Congress for anything. All he needs is an army of constitutional lawyers to churn out those executive orders as efficiently as possible, and as fail-proof in the courts as possible. (Trump didn’t even bother to set up such an army of lawyers, which meant that the courts kept striking down his executive orders and policy changes at quite an embarrassing rate.) We’re in almost at week and Biden is about to pass 40 executive orders, which is more than Trump managed to pass in all of 2017.
There will be little left of Trump’s legacy within government except his very wasteful tax cut laws passed in 2017 and those judges he rammed into the judiciary with the help of Moscow Mitch.
So now Biden, with this decades of government experience, knows how to strike well, quickly, and efficiently, and has gathered a highly seasoned team that will make it happen. He’s not depending on his dense son-in-law and an inexperienced and addled twit—otherwise known as Steve Bannon—to make executive orders stick with the courts. For a “senile old man,” Biden is proving to be quite quick witted.
Let the dismantling of Trump’s legacy begin! :)"
8a00ffcc,What is the point of the butterfly stroke?,"There is no utilitarian purpose to the butterfly stroke, it is purely a competitive stroke. To understand this, you need to understand the history of the stroke. At one time (1950's I believe), the competitive swimming rules did not specify that an above water arm recovery stroke was disallowed in the breaststroke, and some sharp Olympic level competitor experimented with it and determined that it was faster. So he swam with a butterfly arm stroke with a frog kick in breaststroke events. Within a short time, the butterfly stroke became it's own and the dolphin kick permitted, and the original intent of the breaststroke was preserved by requiring an underwater arm recovery. As others have stated, butterfly is the most physically demanding stroke, and well executed, a thing of beauty.
Since the butterfly is purely a competitive stroke, there's also a certain exclusivity to it, since very few people can swim it well who were not at one time competitive swimmers. So it brings with it a certain cachet, or ""pride of ownership,"" much like being a scratch golfer."
bf2cd412,How is it determined if a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic?,"When a patient comes do the Emergency Room with an acute neurological deficit and the probable diagnosis is a stroke, the first exam to be performed is a CT scan to exclude intracranial haemorrhage, which would preclude thrombolysis; to look for any ""early"" signs of infarction; and to exclude other intracranial pathologies that may mimic a stroke, such as tumour.
The first signs of an ischemic stroke may be very subtle and include:
1. A hyperdense segment of a vessel, most communly observed in the middle cerebral artery. It's the earliest sign visible in the CT.
2. Loss of grey-white matter differentiation, and hypoattenuation of deep nuclei, as well as cortical hypodensity with associated parenchymal swelling with resultant gyral effacement. Visible in the first 1-3 hours.
3. Progressive hypo-attenuation and swelling In the first week.
4. And finally, after months, we can see an image of low density, with no mass effect, such as the following:
On the other hand, acute brain haemorrhage appears hyperdense (white) on CT scans, as we can see in the image below:

There are many kinds of intracranial haemorrhage and a long list of images you can get based in the artery affected by an ischemic stroke (all with different clinical onsets). The basic image differences between those two are described above, but if you decide to take a deeper look into the subject, Neurology can be very fascinating.

47ef4c9f,What is considered stroke level high blood pressure?,"Stroke level high blood pressure is a term that is used within the medical field to denote an abnormally, astronomically (at least in terms of what is normal in blood pressures) blood pressure. It’s also a fairly relative term, if I’m being completely honest with you. I’ve heard blood pressures of 180/100 being called “stroke level” even though I don’t consider a blood pressure to be stroke level until we get into the high 200s to 210s systolic (that’s the top number).
I’ve actually had a patient in my ambulance before with a blood pressure of 233/133 she had run out of her bp meds and hadn’t had time to get them refilled. She had a headache and her blood pressure was sky friggin high, but otherwise she was fine. How long she would have been fine for I don’t know, but while she was in my care, she was fine.
The take away here is that different providers will call different pressures stroke level. Usually they start at least concert at about 180 systolic and go up in number and level of urgency from there. Basically, the term “stroke level blood pressure” is a way for healthcare providers to communicate two things. One, that the patient in question has a higher than normal for anyone blood pressure and two, that that patient needs to be given treatment for that pressure soon or he/she could go from just having a headache to being rushed to ct because they hemorrhages and are now having a stroke."

followed biennially for up to 51 years. ... A total of 875 participants
(522 women) developed a first-ever stroke; 749 (448 women) had an

We observed that the LTR of stroke for middle-aged and ""young-old""
adults (55 to 75 years of age) was substantial at 1 in 6 or higher. This
risk was higher in women (1 in 5) compared with men, largely because of
the greater life expectancy in women, which increased their period at

is the third leading cause of death in most countries, and is one of
the leading causes of long-term disability. Women have a higher lifetime
risk of stroke than men (1 in 5 vs 1 in 6), a statistic that is

ceb5c51a,What is the six-stroke engine?,"Generally the thermal efficiency of a four stroke engine is about 40% which means only 40% of the total heat input to engine by burning the fuel is converted into useful work. The remaining 60% heat is lost to the surrounding in terms of exhaust gas and the heat carried away by the cooling water of the radiator. Six stroke engines attempt to recover those waste heats and improve the efficiency of the engines.
The six strokes are-
Suction
Compression
Expansion
Exhaust
Water injection
Steam exhaust
The first 4 strokes of a six stroke engines are similar to four stroke engines i.e., suction,compression, expansion, exhaust. After the fourth stroke, the temperature inside the cylinder is still much higher than that of ambient. So, in the fifth stroke, small water droplets are injected into the cylinder. Due to the high temperature, the water droplets evaporate readily and the steam does the additional work by expanding inside the cylinder and pushes the piston down. In the sixth stroke of the piston, the expanded steams are exhausted into the condenser in which it is condensed into water for reusing it in the further cycles. Thus, one six stroke cycle is completed in 3 revolutions of the crank shaft. The efficiency of the six stroke engines are about 60%. By using 6 stroke engine in place of 4strokes, the fuel consumption can be reduced upto 40%.
The working of the six stroke engines are shown below
Fig: working of six stroke engine
The main challenge in case of six strokes engine is the design of the cam shaft. Because we need to inject water droplets as soon as the exhaust gases leave the engine."
ff44d64f,What's the best course of action when recovering from strokes?,"Immediate treatment is the Number One course for successful stroke recovery. The source of the injury must be identified (is it a clot or a bleed?) and the appropriate treatment to abate that event applied. Since most strokes seem to be ischemic (clot) at first glance, anti-clotting medications can ""bust"" the clot and restore blood flow to the affected areas of the brain. If this treatment is accomplished within a few hours (used to be a three hour window, but that window's been opened a bit wider: Time window for
stroke
treatment should be extended
) damage cane be limited and usually treatable.
The second most-important factor in stroke treatment is swift, aggressive and global therapies, physical, occupational and speech. Physical therapy addresses the need to ""re-teach"" muscles how to work, and to provide the opportunity for damaged neurons to re-route signals around damaged areas. Occupational therapy does this, also, but in the teaching of strategies to accomplish every day tasks, occupational therapy has a terrific track record in that ""re-teaching"". Speech therapy is not limited to speech, itself, but to cognition, also, in addition to swallowing issues. All of the therapies and techniques used help the brain recover from the insult of stroke.
In the event of a suspected stroke:
Get the victim to a hospital ASAP
The hospital administers the correct treatments to bust the clot or stop the bleed ASAP.
Therapies start early and continue until there is no further progress, at which time strategies are worked out to accomplish tasks in weakened areas.
Sometimes, some areas of the brain are so damaged they cannot ""come back"", and the victim needs assistance for the rest of their lives. But advances in treating stroke have become routine in Western medicine, and the outcomes have improved by a very large measure. What would have killed a victim even 25 years ago, is nearly completely recoverable now, as long as swift medical and therapeutic intervention is provided."
d4aed9c7,What is the hardest swimming stroke?,"The butterfly is the most difficult stroke for many reasons. In free style, you are only moving one arm at a time and your shoulders and most of your body are rocking side to side so that whenever you take a stroke, your body twists on it's side and your arm reaches out farther, therefore giving you more power to move the water. In butterfly since you are using both arms, there is absolutely no side ways rotation so both arms having to pull the wait of your body throughout the water. Although you can kick, the kick you use in butterfly (often called dolphin kick) is basically just a result of your body going up and down. The kicking does make a difference, but if you tried doing butterfly with out kicking, your legs would move on their own. Basically, butterfly is the hardest strome because your shoulders and upper arms are doing most of the work, and there is essentially no rest time of either of your arms."
a38c91dc,What precautions should be taken to prevent a heat stroke?,"Most parts of India are boiling at this time with heat waves and high temperatures. To be able to live upto the extreme temperatures, I recommend doing the following:-
Wear light and cotton clothes preferably lighter shades
If possible wear sunglasses and a cap to prevent you face and forehead from catching the wave
Avoid cold drinks completely, not even are they a store house of bad chemicals and pesticides, the chilled cola would give you a sore throat also.
If possible, keep a pack of Glucon-D with you and keep on drinking it in short intervals.
Stay hydrated as much as you can, in the scorching sun we shed enough sweat that we don't feel the need to *pee but discharging it is also essential.
Eat freshly cut salads like cucumbers,tomatoes etc which are rich in water content and have the right minerals required to keep you body cool in this summer
Don't sit/be too close to the AC, direct contact with the cold AC air can be harmful if you are on a mixed climatic environment of hot and Cold."
99539b6a,What causes heat stroke?,"Heat Stroke is a term too loosely used. Properly defined it is a stroke caused by the heat. So this means brain tissue actually dies (often the patient does as well).
So what causes it? Heat. Too much heat. The body has several mechanisms to cope with heat;
number 1 is avoidance- So we move out of the sun into the shade. Jump into a pool or shower, A/C on, hat, fan. What if you can’t? You are an infant in a car, prisoner in a cell, passed out due to drugs or alcohol, alzheimers patient, bed ridden nursing home patient. Well then the temp of your brain raises. Once it gets in the 104–5 range it starts to die and unless someone intervenes so do you
number 2 is sweating. So on a hot day you swet. You swet a lot. Swetting keeps the body temperature down however only until you run out of swet. Then you develope heat exhaustion and you either faint or revert to #1 avoidance.
number 3 is vasodilation. You blood is shunted to the skin and the skin blood vessels dilate. So the skin becomes a large radiator. It helps but if the sun is beating down on the skin or there is not enough fluid in the system then well it can’t improve things."
06d4455f,What are the best songs by The Strokes?,"It really depends on the person, but here I go:
Heart In A Cage has great lyrics and killer riffs and a touch of the strokes’ brand. It’s catchy, rocks out, and grabs your attention. This is my personal favorite song of theirs from their best album (you heard it here first).
Someday. I have never met a person who doesn’t like Someday and it’s just one of THE Strokes’ songs.
Reptilia. This is their most popular song and has a widely recognizable hook. “Please don’t slow me down, if I’m going too fast!” And has catchy guitars. It twists and turns like a room on fire and ends too soon."
936f1cee,Can a lot of stress cause a stroke?,"Yes, In “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers” author, Dr. Robert Sapolsky explains how chronic stress can cause hypertension and atherosclerosis, aka the accumulation of plaques in the blood vessel. Dr. Sapolsky writes about the incredible findings of physiologist Jay Kaplan from Bowman Grey Medical School.
According to Kaplan and his colleagues, primates will form atherosclerotic plaques after social stress. If you turn a monkeys stable dominance hierarchy on its head the end result is enough social stress that provokes a stress response and an overactive sympathetic nervous system.
Overall, the monkeys under the most social stress were most likely to form these dangerous plaques.
Last but not least, once these plaques are formed in the blood vessels, chronic stress may cause increase blood pressure. The increase of blood force is more likely to tear the plaque loose. The now mobile plaque can then make its way to a blood vessel in the brain and cause a stroke!"
e2c4b04e,Which swimming stroke is fastest?,"Front crawl, or freestyle, is the fastest method for all distances over 15 meters. Maybe over 8 meters.
In shorter swims, breaststroke is the fastest. This is because breaststroke has lots of acceleration but the wide leg stance of the kick keeps its high end speed down.
In the between distances, 8–15 meters, one or two breaststroke pulls, followed by freestyle arms and breaststroke kick, followed by freestyle is fastest. To hedge my bets a little, eggbeater kick might work better than whip kick in that middle distance.
For swimming around 25 meters from a dive, underwater dolphin kick might be fastest, with no surface swimming at all. From a push off (already in the water, pushing off a pool wall or I guess a rock or pier in open water), underwater swimming will be fastest for around 15 meters. The gravity assist of a dive makes a big difference!
As a lifeguard, I gotta say the fastest swimming method in doing a rescue is to run on the deck as far as possible and swim the smallest distance. Or canoe or row as close as you can, then get in and swim. I was a fast swimmer but paddling or rowing a boat or running is so much faster than swimming minimizing swim distance is very important."
64489b1e,Is a heat stroke the same as a regular stroke?,"A stroke happens when the blood circulation to the brain suddenly stops, it can be caused by a block (ischemic stroke) or a bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke). It is as if the man is stricken by a hit on his head. He falls unconscious in the worst case scenario or is unable to speak or move a limb, at the best.
In 1960 scientists observed that when you put ‘drosophila’ cells in a warmer culture, some areas of the chromosome (genes) show a tendency of ‘puffing’ which is not a direct effect of the heat but a effect of transcription. Years later the culprit was identified as ‘heat shock’ protein (HSP). HSPs not only get released because of heat, but as the result of a host of stress. They tend to ward off the effect of stress by trashing defective proteins, but often end up in multiple effects much beyond that, including effects of tissue healing and immune response. Surprisingly, HSP is also a pathway involved in apoptosis (programmed cell death).
(Pic Puffed genes) Google.
HSP is a complex pathway of protection and destruction.
Humans are equipped with an excellent air-con system; which makes us live happily in the scorching heat of Sahara desert as well as the icy glaciers of arctic.
(A industrial AC Plant)
The human air-con system is far more complex, more adaptable, highly portable and far more sensitive than the AC plant you see above.
But sometimes in extreme heat, the human system fails. The sweating stops, the skin becomes red hot, the body core-temperature rises to beyond 104 degree F. The person can collapse, become breathless, puff and pant and go into multi-organ failure and die. Heat Stroke. The HSP play a crucial role in the pathobiology.
Neither the drosophila chromosome in the Lab petri-dish or the tourist in the Kalahari desert tolerate extremes of heat. Exposure to heat and expression of HSP once again proves how biological pathways of survival and death are mysteriously interwoven."
40c9bd0c,What are the disadvantages of two-stroke engines over four-stroke engines?,"The Main drawback of two stroke engine over four stroke engine is More Pollution..
Four stroke engine technology now following Bharat Stage -IV (BS-IV) norms, In 2020, BS-VI will expected, (BS-V is skipped).
Two stroke engine have better Power to Weight ratio and produces one power for one rotation of Crankshaft. But it produces more emission hence two stroke engines are restricted.
It requires oil mixed with petrol for better lubrication.
It releases black oil through silencer along with exhaust smoke.
Exhaust smoke is in white color, because during combustion fuel burns along with oil. Oil Burns and produces white smoke. It cause health problems.
It produces more noise and vibrations."

b3e8196f,Is there any way to prevent brain strokes?,"There is a high sense of emergence and careful concern for anyone who is suddenly threatened with a condition of stroke irrespective of either ischemic stroke or haemmorhegic stroke.Its more evidential to notice that ischemic strokes have a slower onset of action which starts with commonly experience symptoms like mild headache,dizziness and imbalance of body movement that leads sudden fallout.Thus to counteract stroke immediately for preventing tragic outcome one should call an amulatory care with in fifteen minutes to seek an urgent care from intensivists who are connected to ICCU and qualified health care professional.Hence if ischaemic stroke is predicted by symptoms than its further damage to brain can be prevented by accessing emergency care to any cardiac unit.While on the contrary if it is a haemmorgic stroke than its more fatal because such stroke are resultant of an accidental injuries where rupturing of blood vessel leads to unconciousness and sudden mortality thus only clue is to rush with an ambulatory care to neurosurgeon who can conduct a needful intervention to stop bleeding and damage to internal parts of brain like medulla oblongata.Over and above stroke episodes are more fatal to human beings which leads to paralaysis of body and loss of speech."
4cc970c0,What are the workings of a four-stroke petrol engine?,"Intake: also known as induction or suction This stroke of the piston begins at top dead center (T.D.C.) and ends at bottom dead center (B.D.C.). In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing vacuum pressure into the cylinder through its downward motion.
Compression: This stroke begins at B.D.C, or just at the end of the suction stroke, and ends at T.D.C. In this stroke the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage.
Combustion: also known as power or ignition This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at T.D.C. (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by aspark plug
(in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft.
Exhaust: also known as outlet. During theexhaust stroke, the piston once again returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through the exhaust valve.
The points 1–4 are the steps of strokes from 1–4 of the engine."
228c764e,How do I stroke ego of a person?,"I write this as a single woman divorced from a sociopath. I gave to him all I could not realising no matter what I did to boost his ego, it could never be enough, he in reality had no feeling of love. Now one would expect me if I found a decent, kind man, I would treat him not badly, but not give of myself as much, but wrong. In a relationship for me anyway I cannot speak for other females, I show love, make him feel special, I give my all because that is who I am. It might never happen for me who knows, but because I had a very bad experience, it doesn’t give me the right to treat another man badly. Love is the best thing ever, to love is to want to put the other before yourself, and love is what makes the world go round, not to have it is dismal, so all of you show it, give it if you are lucky enough to have someone in your life."

7c4eea74,"Do chickens and ducks like being stroked by humans, like cats and dogs do?","I'm going to answer this in regards to chickens, since that's what I have the most experience with (but from the little experience I've had with ducks, it appears to be the same for them). So anyway:
It all depends on each individual chicken. You may not expect it, but they'll all have their own personalities, just like dogs and cats and even humans. Some will absolutely love attention and some will hate it.
For example, one of my hens (Davina) loves being held and will basically try to jump into my arms if I don't immediately pick her up. But then one of my other hens (Autumn) pretty much completely avoids me. She keeps her distance most of the time which becomes very difficult if I need to grab her for any reason. And my other chickens are pretty much somewhere between those two reactions. My rooster hates being grabbed but then once I catch him, he's so happy being held.
So I think the easiest answer to your question would probably just be: Sometimes."

2dfb0683,"What are some signs of a stroke in a dog (just curious, not an emergency)?","I’ve been granted many lovely dogs in my long life, but, as far as I am aware only one actually had a stroke. I noticed that Jodie, one of our Standard Poodles, was suddenly walking in a strange fashion. I could only call it lopsided. She was leaning over, like a ship listing. Her eyes were dull. She didn’t seem to know quite where she was. She tried and failed several times to jump into her chair, but just couldn’t make it. She appeared to react very slowly to anything, almost as though she had been drugged (need I say she wasn’t!). She was a very good age for a S.P., having reached 15, and had slowed down a lot in recent weeks, but this was more than old age. I took her out to pee and had to hold her up (no easy task with a heavy dog!) Then she wanted to poo and before I could steady her, she fell into it. and just lay there struggling to get to her feet. I was crying as I somehow lifted her up, because I knew she was very distressed and the end was coming.
Once I got her back inside, cleaned up, and back into her favourite chair, I phoned our very reliable vet. She knew all our dogs very well and said it sounded as though Jodie had had a stroke. I was also of that opinion, although stupidly, I was very surprised, as I hadn’t considered the fact that dogs could have strokes!
We sat petting her until the vet arrived. The other dogs were strangely quiet. They all loved gentle Jodie who never pushed or hassled any of them. The vet. confirmed that it was indeed a stroke and said that, in her opinion, being such an old dog, Jodie would only get worse and we should consider her distress not ours. The vet. had thoughtfully brought the necessary equipment, so tearfully, we agreed what, after all, was best for Jodie. She drifted off in her chair with all the family around her. Our beautiful gentle giant, once so full of the joy of life. Still greatly missed and thought about so often.

1ec0ec6f,How do you swim butterfly stroke in swimming?,"With difficulty.
Butterfly is a tough stroke to master - in fact, when you're really good at it, it's the least tiring when you're going very fast. So the slower you go the harder it gets.
If you want to go it alone, master your dolphin movement first, and do this underwater with your arms outstretched as straight as they can be as high above your head as possible, as if you were going into a dive.
Begin the dolphin movement at your fingers and imagine a shallow but powerful wave travelling down along your body - so every joint moves a little, but not much. Your knees won't bend any more than a degree - keep your quads and glutes tight.
Another way to imagine it is by kicking with your core muscles - as if you're doing a sit-up. Practice this by laying on your back with your arms outstretched and toes pointed as per a dive, then do a very short-range crunch - moving your head away from the floor by a few degrees only. Now flip over and do this laying on your front - contract your lower back muscles to reflect the movement. When you hold a plastic ruler in the middle and wobble it up and down, this is a close approximation of what your body should be doing.
Master swimming underwater like this, try face up and face down. Get used to inhaling water and don’t panic.
Now - arms.
Your arms are not windmills - they need to follow an hour-glass like pattern underwater as your hands constantly seek water that isn't already moving. Your hands should start in the water directly ahead of your forehead just narrower than shoulder width apart. Then as they pull down, draw outward, then in again toward the bellybutton, then out again toward the waist, exiting the water at the hip with a slight bend in the elbow before the recovery part, which should be as high as possible.
Practice a few arm strokes at a time to get the motion rightly timed with your body movement. Your hands should travel through the water in line with the wave travelling along your body, so your hands exit the water at the hip just as your powerful legs begin their part of the movement - your arms should push you up and forward, as high out of the water as possible. Imagine a push-up where you must also leap forward. When your hands re-enter the water they should be at 45′ with palms facing outwards, ready to push water. Your bum should be high in the water at this point.
Breathing.
I put this last because, bizarrely, the less you can manage to breathe, the less tired you will be - putting your head up to breathe breaks the momentum of your body somewhat, so if you can manage a 50m sprint without breathing you will tire less and be much faster. That said, sooner or later, you will need air, so how to do it?
As your hands are making the second part of the hourglass motion, and beginning to push water down and backwards, this should force your upper body high in the water, as your hips should be lower and your feet in turn high. As your hands catch still water, nudge your chin forward and push up - this should be enough for you to just about clear the water with your mouth to intake a good lung of air. You want to either nudge your chin forward without really changing the level of your head - or - if you're getting powerful, try to raise your whole chest from the water, meaning you don't move your neck at all. Do not tilt your head back from the neck - this will upset your wave-like motion and slow you down, making it super hard to return to an efficient stroke.
Breathe as little as you can, but ensure your stroke is such that you can take in enough air to continue going at pace.
If you manage to fit all that together, you're doing better than I ever did!"

d314f4ce,Can ischemic strokes & hemorrhagic strokes be differentiated without MRI & CT scan? Should a stroke patient be given aspirin by the emergency department?,"For the first question
Answer- Yes
Details- Yes, only if you can-
Show us through a video call/ bring the patient to the ER immediately to show, the progression of onset of stroke.
Answer all our questions while we ask for the history and you do not get pissed off for probing at minute details
We actually can't trust you to do any of these, and jumbling up of treatment protocols for ischaemic and hemorrhagic stroke can be catastrophic. Hence, we do the CT or MRI (depending on indications and contraindications) before deciding on definitive treatment/doing course correction in emergency management.
For the second question
Answer- NO
Details- No, because we don't know the type of stroke, and giving aspirin to a patient of hemorrhagic stroke can be catastrophic. Aspirin is given only in ischaemic stroke."
13866a76,"Will a brain MRI reveal past strokes? If a stroke robust enough not to be considered a TIA were to occur, would it be visible in an MRI years later?","I had a stroke, grand mal seizure which broke my back (L1 and L2) on 10/10/10….not a good day.
Multiple CAT scans and MRI’s showed “moderate brain damage” from “prior strokes”. I had no knowledge of the prior strokes, but my Neurologist showed me the scans and said…”see all that white area….that’s damaged brain cells”….and there was a lot of white. I had a contrast MRI done which showed “recent” damage, based, I was told, on the amount of contrast that was taken up. Oddly, it was not as large as the original damage, but specifically located in the occipital region. This made sense since my stroke caused strange and scary visual disturbances.
I was able to walk out of the hospital the next day, with aphasia, but otherwise seemingly OK. I asked the neurologist if I would be getting therapy for cognitive issues and he said “but you show no cognitive deficit”. In my addlebrained state, I accepted it…but I knew I was not the same.
And here is the important part to people who may have had a stroke. Since only I seemed to be concerned about damage and it was not too apparent to others, I knew that I had to handle my recovery on my own (now I know I should have pushed to get professional help at that time, but I was not thinking clearly).
I decided that I would meditate, play word games and play the guitar every day, since I had read that they help. Every day for about a year I spent 3–4 hours doing both and I am totally convinced that I am 98% recovered due to those efforts. I found Silva Systems tapes to be particularly soothing and helpful to my recovery.
Today, nearly 7 years later most people can observe nothing that would be indicative of a stroke. I’ve developed “coping” mechanisms like double checking everything I write since I can no longer recognize homonyms (some results are humorous), I ask people “have I told you this before” and the answer is “yes” often, so I don’t repeat it. But I have no memory of having said it.
I now also take about every “brain” supplement there is and I do find that some make a difference.
So my prior strokes, (and perhaps recent ones) are not apparent to me, but they are visible on MRI’s. But I believe that, in my case at least, that there are positive outcomes from a difficult situation."
9f43ac9f,"Do bad teeth cause diabetes, and strokes?","How can diabetes affect my mouth?
Too much glucose, also called sugar, in your blood from diabetes can cause pain, infection, and other problems in your mouth. Your mouth includes
your teeth
your gums
your jaw
tissues such as your tongue, the roof and bottom of your mouth, and the inside of your cheeks
Glucose is present in your saliva—the fluid in your mouth that makes it wet. When diabetes is not controlled, high glucose levels in your saliva help harmful bacteria grow. These bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. Plaque also comes from eating foods that contain sugars or starches. Some types of plaque cause tooth decay or cavities. Other types of plaque cause gum disease and bad breath.
Gum disease can be more severe and take longer to heal if you have diabetes. In turn, having gum disease can make your blood glucose hard to control.
What happens if I have plaque?
Plaque that is not removed hardens over time into tartar and collects above your gum line. Tartar makes it more difficult to brush and clean between your teeth. Your gums become red and swollen, and bleed easily—signs of unhealthy or inflamed gums, called gingivitis.
When gingivitis is not treated, it can advance to gum disease called periodontitis. In periodontitis, the gums pull away from the teeth and form spaces, called pockets, which slowly become infected. This infection can last a long time. Your body fights the bacteria as the plaque spreads and grows below the gum line. Both the bacteria and your body’s response to this infection start to break down the bone and the tissue that hold the teeth in place. If periodontitis is not treated, the gums, bones, and tissue that support the teeth are destroyed. Teeth may become loose and might need to be removed. If you have periodontitis, your dentist may send you to a periodontist, an expert in treating gum disease.

60450260,How did you know that you were having a stroke? What were the symptoms? What did it feel like?,"Thank you for your question.
Following two weeks of chronic neck pain which I was told was probably just a sprain, one Sunday night I decided I couldn’t take it any more and I took myself to hospital. I was checked over and although nobody had any idea what was wrong with me, they kept me in overnight for observation.
By this time, it was about 2am and I hadn’t eaten, so I sneaked out of the ward to to buy snacks a can of lemonade from a vending machine. I took it back to my bed, opened the bar of chocolate, and that’s when it happened. I was suddenly overcome with the most nauseating dizziness I’ve ever known in my life. I lunged for the panic button shortly before losing 99% of my motor skills. Nurses quickly appeared and helped me back into bed. I was violently sick, I had no sense of direction, and I was disoriented to the extent that I threw myself off the bed, onto the floor again, thinking I was steadying myself. Then I passed out.
When I woke up the following morning, I felt like I had the most epic hangover, but basically OK - nothing more than a really, really heavy night out on the piss would cause. Still, nobody had a clue what had happened. Over the course of the day, I began to go numb down the right hand side of my body, and this symptom yielded an immediate CT scan. I tried to stand to go the CT, and discovered that I couldn’t stand up; my legs buckled and I crumpled to the floor. The nurses helped me back into bed and instead they pushed me, still in the bed, to the scan.
After being wheeled back from the scan, about half an hour later, a consultant appeared, and showed me a printout of my brain scan; he pointed to the areas in my cerebellum which had died, and then pointed to the withered artery that had caused it. Five minutes later, I was surrounded by paramedics, moved to a stretcher, and transported by ambulance to another hospital with a specialist stroke unit.
Over the next three days, with physiotherapy and sheer bloody-minded determination, I managed to figure out how to stand up again, and to walk after a fashion. I was discharged, and because I felt that I had something to prove, I turned down the offer of a taxi, and instead went home by bus. It was a very difficult bus ride, but I felt better having done it.
The next day, I was watching TV, and it happened again. The same symptoms, except this time it was accompanied by both my hands closing up like those naff crane grip games you get at the seaside. This time around, I knew what was happening - and I remained completely lucid for a time.
It’s the most uncomfortable feeling I think you’re capable of feeling; to know that you are feeling, first hand, parts of your brain physically dying. You can almost feel the metaphorical lights going off in your head. You can feel yourself mental capacity andcontrol over your own body diminishing.
I remember looking down at my hands and watching them shake, spasm, and close like grotesque arthritic claws. I remember the look on my mother’s face as she sat in front of me, her eyes piercing mine as she watched what could have been my last seconds on earth.
I completely understood everything that was happening. I know what it feels like to actually become brain damaged; I wish I could explain it. I felt as though I was losing my mind; literally and figuratively - and at the same time I was somehow still aware enough to actually notice it happening.
I did remain conscious but shortly after this point, my memory becomes a little blurry - I have a recollection of paramedics again lifting me onto a stretcher. My mother told me later that I had tried to make a lame joke about the ambulance being brand new - but I barely remember anything at all. But my recall of the event is like a foggy dream; fragments of imagery and colour and sensations and very little else.
By the time I regained my awareness, I was back at hospital and in resuscitation. A nurse I recognised from before was passing me a cup of water. I remember a flurry of activity, more scans, various injections, a succession of tests, and then awakening the following afternoon back in my original ward (though two beds along) to the sight of my entire family gathered around my bedside.
Further tests and another brain scan that day revealed more extensive damage to my cerebellum, and I was once again bed-ridden.
I remember lying in that bed, that night, thinking about how my life would look from then on. At the time I was in a group with eight friends in a Go-karting tournament, and I worried that I wouldn’t be able to drive again. Then it occurred to me that I might not be able to walk again. I cried - and the next morning I forced myself to stand up, and over the next week, the physiotherapist helped me a lot, and though I couldn’t do much for more than five minutes at a time, I was able to stand up and walk - albeit slowly - unaided by the time I was discharged.
When I was discharged, I did take a taxi - mainly because my doctor walked with me to the door and insisted - and I spent the next two months trying to figure out how to do perfectly ordinary things - making a cup of tea, turning on the television, walking up and down the stairs were all crazily-complicated and when I achieved them, I felt as though I’d just won a gold medal at the Olympics.
At the end of the two months, at my own request, I was allowed to go back to work - albeit for only three hours a day (that gradually went back up to full time) and I began slotting my life back together.
Four years later, I’m still here. Lasting symptoms are largely gone, although there are a handful of “reminders” of what happened; I still have patches of (predominantly) the right-hand side of my body I can’t feel - including my right hand, the top of my head, and a patch of skin about the size of a credit card just above my navel. The doctors discovered a minor difference in response time between my left and right hand sides, which made typing difficult as my brain was sending all the signals at the right time, but my right hand was doing things a fraction of a second later than the left - but I learned to type all over again and six months after the stroke, I was back at my original speed and accuracy.
I’m a little clumsier than I used to be, and sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I can’t feel my arms and legs - but they wake up pretty quickly and I’m off to get on with my business.
What’s odd is that people have described subtle changes in my personality since the stroke; that I’m substantially the same person, of course, but that I am a little shorter of temper, and seem to appear more confident in social situations. To compliment that, I feel different - and that’s another feeling I’m going to have a hard time explaining. I feel like me, but a different version, a different “hardware revision” I suppose - Richard 1.0 had a stroke and woke up as Richard 1.1. I’m the same person, I look the same, I sound the same, but my circuits are wired up a bit different now.
And it’s true - less than 40% of my cerebellum survived, but my brain just re-routed around the problems and I can walk, I can run, I can write, I can speak, I can drive, I can bowl, I can cook, I can write music; I can do everything I did before - but since 2015 I feel like my brain downloaded Waze; I can still go to the same destinations, but the route is a bit different now and there’s still some roads along the way I’m really not familiar with.
I’m still getting to know myself again - but the new version of me is enough like the old version that I’m comfortable.
All things considered, I escaped with a bloody nose. Others aren’t so lucky.
My uncle had a stroke a couple of years before I did, in his mid fifties, and on paper it was less serious than mine - but he didn’t walk at all for a month and his right hand is now almost paralysed.
I could’ve easily died; or possibly ended up confined to a wheelchair and lost my ability to speak. I count my lucky stars that I made it as intact as I did.
Folks, please remember - the common symptoms of a stroke are only the common symptoms - not the only symptoms.
It’s possible to have a stroke and absolutely none of the common symptoms manifest.
This is yet another reason why, when something serious happens to you, the absolute worst thing you can do is self-diagnose yourself. My situation was so odd, not even a hospital full of specialist doctors could diagnose me for a few days.
You need to call an ambulance."

93872944,How does a 2-stroke diesel engine work?,"Two stroke Detroit Diesel engines were once popular here in the USA, but they failed to advance fuel economy and emissions fast enough to be practical going forward. They were discontinued in the seventies.
For the two stroke 53, 71 and 92 series engines, a roots type blower was a mandatory part of the engine. Later on, turbochargers were available as well.
The Detroit diesel worked like this. There was a circle of ports all the way around the bottom of the cylinder. The ports were uncovered near bottom dead center and the blower blew a very strong draft through this area, clean air in one side and clean air and exhaust out the other. When the piston came down the fresh air evacuated the exhauat and filled the cylinder with freah air to be compressed. Just beyond top dead center, duel was injected and as i n all dieaels, combustion was imediate.
The Detroit Diesel was unique in that almost 25% of engine coolinh was derived from thia airflow. A great deal of the charge air blew right throigh the engine without ever being compressed or mixed with fuel and burned.
At any rate, theae engines were never cleaned up to current standards. Detroit Diesel instead dropped their name on a clean sheet design 4 stroke dieael, the Series 60 engines which turned.out to be a very good design, right out of the box at 430 HP. Mike Heaton"
dda9b9ae,In a four stroke engine where does energy come from to move the piston up and down?,"That is tricky... in a four stroke engine, the only source of energy being the fuel , the energy to move piston comes only from the burning of fuel !!
Well I assume that your question goes a little detailed as what is the driving force that makes the piston move in every stroke.
To initiate the engine , we run the crankshaft with a motor run by a battery ,which was charged when the engine was running.

During the first cycle the crankshaft run by the motor opens the inlet valves
connected by gears to the crankshaft such that the fuel charge is sucked in.
the pressure of the air fuel charge itself helps the piston complete the suction stroke.
During the second stroke, the inertia of the crankshaft makes the piston move upward and compress the charge.
During the third stroke is where the combustion is initiated and the sudden burst of the fuel pushes the piston down rotating the crankshaft.
During the last stroke again the inertia in the crankshaft pushes the piston upwards to push the exhaust gases out with the opening of the exhaust valves.
the crank wheel is by itself designed to make the piston move by the factor of inertia in the IC engine."

3d707766,What would happen if I put 2 stroke petrol in a 4 stroke engine?,"Theres no such thing as 2 stroke fuel. A 2 stroke engine uses regular gasoline to which you add a small amount of oil. The difference beteen 2 stroke and 4 stroke is a 2 stroke has no pressure oiling system so it has to be added to the fuel for cylinder lubrication. You cant run a 2 stroke engine long without added oil or it will seize. You can run a 4 stroke motor with fuel youve mixed for a 2 stroke. You may have oil smoke from the exhaust or foul plugs over some time, but it wont hurt the engine. You cannot run diesel fuel in a gas engine or vice versa either."

1b39e175,What is the practical application of 2 stroke CI engine?,"Practical examples of a 2 stroke CI or Diesel engine that I know is the engine in a British Army Chieftain tank and a model of British Diesel Electric railway locomotive. I believe the tank engine was a design captured at the end of the Second World War and was actually a Dornier bomber engine. This was a dual crankshaft 6 cylinder with 12 pistons coming together in the centre of the cylinder to make compression and hence fire the fuel. The fuel was injected through the wall of the cylinder and a gear chest was then used to transmit the drive. In the tank the intake is supplemented by a Rootes type supercharger to increase power. This was very unreliable and was only pursued because of a mandate at the time(60’s) of a need to have a multi fuel engine. The engine was mounted horizontally in the wing of the aircraft but vertically in the tank. The main flaw was that the plane would take off and after a climb would then stay at a set throttle for hours, this combined with a modest output gave a reliable use. In the tank it was boosted to 650 plus horsepower and the constant changing of RPM during mobile use caused the cylinder liners to move and distort leading to coolant loss and catastrophic failure. The railway engine powered a generator for the motive power and again tended to run at a set rate for hours giving good reliability. There were no valves like a 4 stroke and the timing of the intake and exhaust was by radially placed ports in the cylinder wall which were uncovered in a sequence of crankshaft timing."
868ac0b9,Why had to develop a 4-stroke engine in place of 2-stroke?,"Pollution mostly. two stroke engines burn their fuel very poorly compared to a four stroke. You are burning two stroke oil, you have to put the two stroke oil in with the fuel on a two stroke engine and the result of this is smoke once it has been burnt causes pollution and as has been mentioned their exhaust gases are smelly.
For the same engine capacity you tend to get more power out of a two stroke engine than you do out of a four stroke. For example a 5.7L two stroke V8 would actually be more powerful than a 5.7L four stroke V8.
The thing is the high levels of pollution is why two strokes are not popular. Imagine if everyone drove a two stroke."
2ec04d79,Why don't we have an 8 or a 16 stroke engine? Is there a possibility to have such engines in the near future?,"Each engine stroke performs a certain action. In the case of a 4-stroke engine, that's:
1. intake (pulls in fuel and air)
2. compression (compresses the mixture)
3. power/ignition (explosive expansion of the fuel)
4. exhaust (exhaust gasses expelled
A two-stroke engine combines these steps, something like:
1. intake/compression (first half of the cycle does intake, second half compresses)
2. ignition/exhaust (first half of the cycle does ignition, second half exhaust)
We don't have an 8 stroke engine because there just aren't any more than 4 steps that are necessary to accomplish combustion and release of waste gasses. We also don't WANT to have any more than a 4-stroke engine because it's inefficient - only one of the four strokes of the engine is producing any kinetic energy; even if you could, having any more is either wasteful or just a multiple of an existing two/four stroke engine."
e88bb0f2,How many strokes are there available in an engine?,"There are 2 stroke and 4 stroke engines available today with 4 stroke engines being the most common.
2 stroke engines nowadays are only found in small machinery.
The processes that occur in a 4 stroke engine are sucction, compression, expansion and exhaust. Here power is produced in expansion stroke where the fuel gets ignited.
2 stroke engines have ports instead of valves i.e., exhaust port and transfer port. After the combustion of fuel, the piston moves downwards, opening the exhaust port. Further downward movement of piston, uncovers the transfer port and as a result the air fuel mixture which is fed directly to the crankcase is forced up through the transfer port into the combustion chamber. This fresh incoming charge helps in removing the exhaust in the cylinder.
In this type of engine, there is a tendency for mixing of exhaust with fresh mixture."

38fde42f,Why do railways prefer two-stroke diesel engines in locomotives over 4-stroke engines?,"Despite what everyone has stated the railroads do not prefer the two-stroke diesel it was more a factor of what was supplied by the locomotive manufacturers of which there are two in the US, EMD, and GE. The EMD diesel was always two-stroke but the GE’s were always four-stroke. It was true that the EMD locomotives were more popular historically but that began to change in the early 90’s with many new innovations by the GE dash series locos. At some point (after I retired) EMD actually added a four-stroke engine but I believe they still supply the 710 series two-banger engine which was a good one. The rail service continued to demand more and more H.P. and the manufacturers tried to deliver. This eventually led to a problem with the crankshaft bearings on the EMD 2-strokes 645 engines. This was caused by the welded steel construction (in part) of the frame which was flexing under heavy loads, with the new power rating. This caused even more purchases of the GE’s equipped with the FDL series engines 4-stroke. I personally liked the 2-strokers better because I considered them easier to work on. The EMD’s did not use pushrods but they still needed 2 camshafts with extra gears to drive them so the two engines were not significantly different as far as running gear. By the way, some have confused 2-stroke diesel with small engine operation. Diesels never use crankcase pressure at all in their cycle."
24d11b66,Do you know about stroke?,"It depends on the severity of the stroke. If it’s a massive stroke it will likely kill you, instantly. If it moderate or a TIA, your chances may be 50:50 if you know what your looking for. What follows is a short list of noticeable symptoms to look for if you’re having or just had a stroke.
You suddenly become extremely dizzy, one side of your face droops or sags, one corner of you mouth turns downward, have a sudden weakness in your limbs , trouble standing or walking, difficulty speKing , slurred speech. Numbness in two of you limbs on the same did.
In 2014, I had a TIA sitting at my kitchen table reading the morning paper. Suddenly , in a microsecond, I knew something had just happened but I didn’t know what. The first physical thing I noticed is when I reached for my water bottle, instead of grasping it I didn’t open my tight hand and just knocked it over. For whatever reason I started to do some hand exercises and quickly realized I couldn’t do with my right what my left had did easily. I sat there for a few minutes, still trying to figure out what had just happened. I certainly wasn’t considering a stroke. So I got up from the table, took a shower and drove to the medical school where I worked. Walking to my office I encountered the Dean, and stopped to ask him a question. He suddenly stepped in front of me, looked me square in the eyes and asked “do you feel alright”?. I started to answer that something strange had happened at my home when he interrupted and said matter of factorly, “ I know what happened, you’ve had a stroke, the right side of your mouth is dropping”! In less than 10 minutes they had me in the ER being examined for a stroke. That was later confirmed by my neurologist reading an MRI I had just been given. He told me it was a non-hemorrhagic TIA I suffered in my left brain hemisphere, in an area consistent with the symptoms I had been describing. So like most individuals who suffer a mild stroke, I was aware something had happened but I never considered a stroke."
56085231,Can an MRI show a stroke?,"Absolutely! MRI is an excellent tool for detecting, localizing and stratifying severity of strokes that happen anywhere within an hour of ictus (the moment that the clot occurs and symptoms begin), and any time thereafter. It can identify regions of damaged brain which shrink over time (“encephalomalacia”) that occur with chronic infarcts and are present for the rest of one’s life. Neurologists and other doctors can use this information to better understand the resultant damage from a stroke, neural deficits (e.g., facial droop, difficulty speaking, arm\leg weakness) and possible medical management to decrease risk of future strokes.
Atherosclerosis and arterial plaques are common sources of strokes (little pieces break off the bigger vessels in the neck then flow with the blood ainto the brain, wedge into the smaller downstream arteries supplying the brain and block it from getting oxygenated blood, resulting in tissue ischemia, ie “stroke” or infarct. This mechanism is so common for stroke that most people with strokes will also get some sort of extra imaging with the CT or MRI to look at these vessels. “CTA” (CT Angiogram) or “MRA” (MR Angiogram) are the names of these “addon” exams that can be performed at the same time as the CT or MRI which is looking at the brain tissue itself.
MRI can also identify the presence of blood products in a stroke (e.g., “hemorrhagic stroke”) which can be helpful in intervention of acute strokes - although CT can identify acute hemorrhage just as well or sometimes better than MRI. MRI is better for old or chronic blood products. A smaller portion of strokes with hemorrhage are not due to atherosclerosis but are due to hypertension. These types of strokes occur in characteristic areas of the brain and, when identified, will clue the clinician to get better control of a patient’s blood pressure to prevent similar events in the future.
2 small points getting back to the original question. A TIA (transient ischemic attack) is a condition with symptoms identical to stroke, but resolve within 24 hours. By definition, the MRI (or CT) should not show any brain damage to account for the symptoms (otherwise it is a stroke). This is important because it can be a key intervention point to medical management for prevention of an ACTUAL stroke down the road. For example, a doctor may prescribe anti-platelet drugs like aspirin or plavix to decrease the risk of plaque rupture if present in those neck arteries.
The other point is that contrast (gadolinium) enhanced MRI is not necessary for simply identifying whether or not a stroke has occurred at some point in a patient’s life. Further, contrast is not needed to differentiate an acute from chronic stroke. But there is one situation where contrast may be helpful and that is when trying to figure when a recent stroke might’ve occurred. Without getting into too much detail, a region of brain that looks damaged from a stroke can be identified as “subacute” if it shows gadolinium enhancement on MRI. That means the stroke is neither super recent or super old, but happened somewhere betwee 1 day and 3 weeks ago. The different ages of stroke are generally broken down as follows (although small variances in the timeframe depend on who you ask, and from patient to patient): hyperacute (0-6 hours), acute(6-24 hours), subacute (1 day to 3 weeks), chronic (>3 weeks)."

You need a means of controlling the intake port so it can suck all air in when possible, then close off while the transfer port can be opened after the air gets compressed, you could use a rotary intake valve for doing this.

2. You may consider plating the rotary valve with black diamond ceramic so it’ll be able to last as long as possible.

3. You may also have to consider fuel injection into a small swirling prechamber like they did for them Toyota cars in the 1970’s, possibly air-assisted fuel injection like that company Orbital UAV has worked on and made since its orbital engine concept in the 1970’s didn’t pan out and the company’s people kept improving on that injection system to this day.

4. Timing these parts would have to be considered and be kept up.

1d0ae146,How do I convert a 4-stroke petrol into a 2-stroke engine to run on compressed air?,"I guess you would call an engine run on compressed air a 2-stroke, but I'm not sure its all that meaningfully. I also can't think of a reason to convert a 4-stroke gasoline engine to run on compressed air.
The way you would do it is to change the camshaft sprockets or gears so that they had a one-to-one ratio with the crankshaft and then have a cam ground so that it openes the intake valve at the top of the stroke and the exhaust valve at the bottom. You likely would need to change the intake valve spring to one with a higher rate to compensate for the air pressure that is trying to open the valve. I suspect that you will have to modify the intake manifold to deal with the pressure.
I think a 4-stroke will turn if you were just to apply air pressure to the intake. You likely will have turn anything less than a 4 cylinder over with a starter or crank to get it started as its possible or maybe likely it will be at a position with all the intake valve closed or maybe on open with the piston before TDC."
8223e452,Which needs more lubrication 2 stroke or four stroke engine?,"FOUR STROKE ENGINE
Four-stroke engines are lubricated by oil held in an oil sump. The oil is distributed through the engine by splash lubrication or a pressurized lubrication pump system; these systems may be used alone or together.
Splash lubrication is achieved by partly submerging the crankshaft in the oil sump. The momentum of the rotating crankshaft splashes oil to other engine components such as the cam lobes, wrist pins and cylinder walls.
Pressurized lubrication uses an oil pump to provide a pressurized film of lubricant between moving parts such as the main bearings, rod bearings and cam bearings. It also pumps oil to the engine’s valve guides and rocker arms.
TWO STROKE ENGINE
Two-stroke engines collect some oil beneath the crankshaft; however, two-stroke engines employ a total-loss lubrication system that combines oil and fuel to provide both energy and engine lubrication. The oil and fuel are combined in the cylinder’s intake tract and lubricate critical components such as the crankshaft, connecting rods and cylinder walls.
Oil-injected two-stroke engines inject the oil directly into the engine, where it mixes with the fuel, while premix two-stroke engines require a fuel-oil mixture that is combined before being installed in the fuel tank. In general, two-stroke engines are known to wear more quickly than four-stroke engines because they don’t have a dedicated lubricant source.

RECOGNIZING A STROKE
Thank God for the sense to remember the '3' steps, STR. Read and Learn.
Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.
Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three (3) simple questions:
S *Ask the individual to SMILE.
T *Ask the person to TALK and SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE (Coherently)
(i.e. Chicken Soup)
R *Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS.
If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks, call emergency number immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher.

095d05a8,How are guitar chords made (in physics)? Why does stroking five strings make an A chord in terms of frequency?,"From a musical point of view, you make an A major chord with the notes A, C# and E. These are musically significant because C# is approximately the fifth harmonic of A (a 5:1 frequency ratio) shifted down two octaves (a 1:4 ratio), i.e. 5:4. And E is the third harmonic (3:1) shifted down one octave (1:2), i.e., 3:2.
You have a fair bit of flexibility musically to choose exactly which A, which C# and which E, and different ""voicings"" give different effects. You can move any of them up or down an octave (a 2:1 or 1:2 frequency change), and the A doesn't necessarily have to be the lowest note. If the musical context it strong you might be able to leave one out and just imply it. If you want a rich sounding chord you might double one or more of them in different octaves.
Then when you know what you'd like, you need to wrestle with the practicalities of approximating it on the guitar without tying your left hand in knots. You have 6 strings, E, A, D, G, B, E, and each of them has frets placed so as to shorten the strings and raise the pitch in units of musical half steps (a.k.a., semitones), which are twelfths of an octave. Physically that's to say that each higher fret raises the frequency a factor of the twelfth root of 2, 2^(1/12)=1.0594630944. (That's the same interval as between adjacent notes on the piano.) 5/4 is close to four half-steps, or 2^(4/12)=1.25992105. 3/2 is close to seven half-steps or 2^(7/12)=1.498307077. All the musical notes are close enough to some number of half-steps apart. So you have to start with each open note and try to get a finger to a fret that will make it an A, C# or E. If that's not feasible for a particular string given the other choices you've made, then you may have to avoid sounding it."
d5a8b0e2,Why does cracking one's neck increase the risk of stroke?,"This pops up in the news frequently and has been proven false. In all cases, the stroke was in progress prior to the visit to the chiropractor. Multiple studies have been done that were unable to find a link between the two. Researchers from the Departments of Neurosurgery, at Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Loma Linda University Medical Center and The Pennsylvania State University, in conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of chiropractic neck manipulation and cervical artery dissection, found no convincing evidence to support a causal link. Further, the authors conclude that the unfounded belief in causation may lead to episodes of litigation.156Church et al. (2016) CureusWhedon et al. in a 2015 cohort study published in Spine Journal found that, “among Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years with an office visit for a neuro-musculoskeletal problem, risk of injury to the head, neck, or trunk within 7 days was 76 percent lower among subjects with a chiropractic office visit than among those who saw a primary care physician.”157Whedon et al.

We conclude that manipulation is an unlikely cause of VBA stroke. The positive association between primary care provider (PCP) visits and VBA stroke is most likely due to patient decisions to seek care for the symptoms (headache and neck pain) of arterial dissection. We further conclude that using chiropractic visits as a measure of exposure to manipulation may result in unreliable estimates of the strength of association with the occurrence of VBA stroke.”159Kosloff et al. (2015) Chiropractic Manual TherapyIn a 2008 population-based, case-control and case-crossover study published in Spine Journal, Cassidy et al. concluded that “Vertebrobasilar Artery (VBA) stroke is a very rare event in the population.

6c91d416,What is a two stroke engine?,"The below information could be found in this link with Images and animations also : How does two
stroke
engine works ?
The 2 stroke engine is a type of Internal combustion engine where one power cycle is completed with two strokes of the piston during only one rotation of crankshaft.
The 2 stroke engine performs all the same steps which are performed by 4 stroke engine i.e intake stroke, compression stroke, power stroke & exhaust stroke; but the 2 stroke engine performs all the 4 process(stroke) in only 2 stroke.
The first commercial two-stroke engine involving in-cylinder compression is attributed to Scottish engineer Dugald Clerk, who patented his design in 1881
Application : Two-stroke engines are generally less expensive to build compared to four-stroke engines, and they are lighter and can produce a higher power-to-weight ratio. For these reasons, two-stroke engines are ideal in applications such as chainsaws, weed trimmers, outboard motors, off-road and motorcycles.Two-stroke engines are also easier to start in cold temperatures, making them ideal for use in snowmobiles
Components of two stroke engine
Main Components of Two stroke engine :
Spark plug : A spark plug delivers electric current to the combustion chamber which ignites fuel.The spark produced is used to burn the fuel in the cylinder.
Piston : Piston is the reciprocating part of the engine. It is used for transferring the energy of the expansion of gases to crankshaft using connecting rods
Connecting rod : It connects the piston and crankshaft. It transfer the power from the piston to the crankshaft.
Crank case : It acts as the base of the engine. It supports the crankshaft and camshaft in suitable bearings and provides the arms for supporting the engine on the frame.
Crank shaft : It is that part of the engine which is used to convert the reciprocating motion of the engine into the rotating motion with the help of a connecting rod.
Inlet port & Exhaust port : The fresh charge enters into the cylinder through inlet port and transfer the burnt gases out of the engine through exhaust port.
Counterweight : Counterweight on crankshaft are used to reduce the vibrations due to imbalances in the rotating assembly
Counterweight are used to prevent bending of crankshaft by offsetting the weights of rod and pistons. For a crankshaft to be balanced, at any point in the assembly’s rotation, the sum of all of the forces are roughly equal to zero. If the crankshaft is not balanced, it will deform especially at pressure points and eventually fail.
In two stroke engines, there is no suction and exhaust strokes. There are only two remaining strokes the compression stroke and power stroke. These are usually called the upward stroke and downward stroke. Also, instead of valves, there are inlet and exhaust ports in two stroke cycle engines.
Working principle of two stroke engine is explained in as shown in diagram below :
1. Upward Stroke
2. Downward Stroke
1. Upward stroke:
During upward stroke, the piston moves from BDC to TDC and compresses the charge (air-fuel mixture) in the combustion chamber of the cylinder.
Because of the upward movement of the piston a partial vacuum is created in the crankcase and this allows the entry of the fresh charge into the crankcase through uncovered inlet port.
The exhaust port and the inlet port remains covered when the piston at the TDC.
The ignition of the fresh charge is takes place by the spark plug.
2. Downward stroke:
As soon as the combustion of the fresh charge takes place, a large amount of the pressure created due to combustion of fuel exerts a very high pressure force on the top of the piston. Due to this high pressure force, the piston moves downward and rotates the crankshaft
During this stroke the inlet port is covered by the piston and the new charge is compressed in the crankcase.
Further downward movement of the piston uncovers first the exhaust port and the transfer port and the exhaust starts through the exhaust port.
As soon as the transfer port opens, the charge through it is forced into the cylinder.
The charge strikes the deflector on the piston crown, rises to the top of the cylinder and pushes out most of the exhaust gases.
The piston is now at BDC position. The cylinder is completely filled with the fresh charge but it is somewhat diluted with the exhaust gases.
Finally the cycle event is then repeated. We get two strokes for the single revolution of the crankshaft."

1b671f72,"In a four-stroke cycle, does the minimum temperature inside the engine cylinder occur at the beginning of the suction stroke or the end of the suction stroke?","Because you have your intake cycle immediately after your combustion cycle, the cylinder head (internal) and valves are hotter now than at any other moment after the ignition flash.
The piston has just pushed out the hot exhaust gasses, which although less hot than the initial flaming of the air fuel mix are leaving a lot of their heat in the wall and head of the chamber, your engine is now, at inlet valve opening, sucking in “cold” air fuel mix, which has an immediate cooling effect on both the cylinder head and the cylinder wall, and also the piston head. Luckily it does, other wise your engine would melt.
At the Begining of the suction stroke, everything is hot, the air fuel mix comes in but has a lot of work to do cooling everything down. By the time it has sucked in a whole cylinder of air, the chamber cylinder temperature will be at its lowest point at the bottom of the cycle, the air fuel mix has been progressivly absorbing the heat as it comes in, as it does so, it expands, filling the cylinder more quickly than is desireable and resisting the in coming air fuel mix. So you will find that despite the suction of the piston as it descends, it is not getting a uniform amount of air coming in throughout the cycle.
In a badly set up engine, or one that is suffering from hot cylinders, you might even get the air fuel mixture to auto ignite, causing a “backfire” (more than one reason for backfires)
So, I’m pretty confident that you can take the moment of least temperature in the cylinder as being at bottom dead centre, where the air fuel mix has absorbed all of the heat energy from the cylinder that it can.
This is not a good thing for the efficiency of the engine, but a good thing for its cooling.
Thanks for the asking."
9604b8a8,What is the working principle of a 4-stroke diesel engine?,"Basically, there are two types of diesel engine types - the Four Stroke and Two
Stroke
. The 'Diesel Cycle' uses higher Compression-Ratio
. It was named after German engineer Rudolph Diesel, who invented and developed first Four-Stroke diesel
engine. The four strokes of the diesel cycle are similar to that of a petrol engine
. However, the 'Diesel Cycle' considerably defers by the way the fuel system supplies the diesel the engine and ignites it.
A conventional internal combustion diesel engine works on 'Diesel Cycle'. In the simple diesel engines, an injector
injects diesel into the combustion chamber above the piston directly. The 'Compression-Ignition engine' is also another name for the Diesel engine. This is mainly because it burns the diesel
with hot and compressed air. The temperature of the air inside the combustion chamber rises to above 400°c to 800°c. This, in turn, ignites the diesel
injected into the combustion chamber. Thus, the 'Diesel Cycle' does not use an external mechanism such as a spark-plug to ignite the air-fuel mixture.
The Four-Stroke diesel engine works on the following cycle:
1. Suction Stroke – With pistons moving downwards and the opening of the inlet valve creates the suction of clean air into the cylinders.
Diesel Suction Stroke
2. Compression – With the closing of Inlet valve the area above the piston gets closed. The piston moves up resulting in compression of the air in a confined space under higher compression-ratio
.
Diesel Compression Stroke
Combustion Process - At this stage, the injector
sprays the diesel into the combustion chamber. The rise in temperature of the air caused by its compression; results in instantaneous burning of diesel with an explosion. This causes heat to release which generates expanding forces known as power
.
Diesel Engine Combustion
3. Power Stroke – Furthermore, these forces again push the pistons downwards resulting in their reciprocating motion.
Diesel Power Stroke
4. Exhaust Stroke – On their way up, the pistons push the exhaust gases above them thru’ the exhaust valve which opens during the exhaust stroke.
Diesel Exhaust Stroke
This cycle repeats itself until the engine turns off, resulting in the continuance of engine’s running.
4 Stroke Diesel Engine Animation
A diesel engine is mainly classified into two types - Indirect-Injection
(IDI) & Direct-injection
(DI). The Direct-Injection
diesel
cycle was an earlier generation technology. It later evolved into its successor & more advanced CRDi
. Earlier generation utility vehicles, trucks, buses & generators still widely use the simple DI
engines. Furthermore, sophisticated & refined CRDi
engines became very popular in the Sedans, MPVs, SUV
s and Luxury cars in the recent past."
2b4e28af,"Many doctors urge you to take your blood pressure medications to prevent a stroke, but new studies seem to indicate that blood pressure pharmaceuticals cannot prevent a stroke but can even induce strokes. What are we to believe?","Excellent question!
Okay, lets unpack this a bit because your conclusion is based on a very common mistake laypersons make when interpreting scientific data.
You didn’t provide a link to your source info. But, the data I believe you’re referring to comes from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study from 2015 that came out of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).
The study included a cohort of 26,785 black and white patients with hypertension, aged at least 45 years old, who were followed over a period of 6.3 years. At the start of the study, 12,327 participants had blood pressure successfully treated by anti-hypertensives (SBP < 140 mmHg) and 4,090 participants unsuccessfully treated with anti-hypertensives (SBP > 140 mmHg). At the end of the follow-up period, over 820 participants experienced a stroke.
Here’s where you’re getting confused…
According to the data, the risk of stroke went up by 33% with each blood pressure medication required to treat blood pressure to goal.
After reading this sentence, it might be natural to think:
People who took more medicine had more strokes. So, the additional blood pressure medications caused the stroke!?
If you thought that, you’d be wrong.
The medicines didn’t cause the stroke.
The severity of hypertensive disease is what contributed to increased stroke risk.
And because more severe hypertension is associated with more medicines required to treat the disease, we see that people taking more medicines had more strokes.
We know this because, if those patients had not received those medicines for hypertension, their risk of stroke would have gone up astronomically. This indicates that the degree of good hypertension control is what mediates stroke risk, not the medicine itself.
We could also show this by giving these anti-hypertensive medicines to people without severe hypertension and observing that stroke risk does not increase in the absence of severe hypertension. However, this would be unethical as giving anti-hypertensives to people with normal blood pressure would result in an unsafe drop in blood pressure.
Ultimately, your best protection against a stroke is to keep from having high blood pressure in the first place. And, if you do develop high blood pressure, you can reduce your stroke risk with a combination of medicine and lifestyle changes to make sure your hypertension doesn’t become more severe.
TL;DR
The REGARDS study out of University of Alabama showed that the more medicines you need to control your blood pressure, the higher your risk of stroke.
From this data, it is easy to mistakenly conclude that the medicines caused the stroke. This is incorrect.
Strokes are caused by high blood pressure, not by the medicines that treat high blood pressure.
We know this because patients who do not receive anti-hypertensive medicines to control their high blood pressure have astronomical stroke risk. Why? Because they would have crazy high blood pressure.
Therefore, it only appears that hypertensive medicines increase stroke risk because people with more severe hypertension take more of these meds. In reality, the mediating factor is hypertension severity.
If you want to prevent stroke, you need to prevent high blood pressure."
64acc0c8,"Which engines are more powerful, 2 stroke or 4 stroke?","For the same displacement, a 2-stroke has twice the max HP to a 1st approximation. A bit less since less efficient combustion. There is not a clean separation between the exhaust and intake air-fuel mixture like in a 4-stroke. They also may not be able to run quite as high rpm (HP = torque x rpm). Before they became illegal due to emissions regulations, there were some hot 2-stroke motorcycles. The Yamaha 350 2 cylinder was termed a “pocket rocket” by one magazine the last year it was sold (1974?). Two guys at my engineering college had Kawasaki 750 3 cyl bikes. The engine looked tiny since no overhead valve hardware, more like an old flat-head engine. One could kill themselves fast on those bikes.
The main problem operating a 2-stroke is that they only run well above a certain speed, say 1500 rpm. That has to do with how the intake air-gas must flow to push the exhaust out the ports (termed “scavenge”). Owners would have to constantly rev the engine at a stop light to keep from dying. One also had to rev the engine and feather the clutch when taking off, which causes more wear. Unlike a H-D 4-stroke where you let out the clutch and just twist the throttle to get all the torque you want. Even long ago in off-road motorcycles, 4-strokes were used when low-end torque was needed for slow crawling, like in “Trials” competitions (woodland paths over logs, more popular in Europe)."
0619ee1d,What are the advantages and disadvantages of four strokes?,"Advantages compared to a two stroke engine:
Far better fuel economy
almost no oil consumption
Far better emissions
Higher reliability in thermally difficult situations
Disadvantages:
far more complex to manufacture
worse weight to power ratio
less smooth operation, because each cylinder fires only every second revolution
requires frequent oil changes
The main drawback of the two stroke engine is the principle of blowing exhaust gas out of the cylinder by pressing fresh air-petrol gas into the cylinder. This always causes losses. So, somewhere in the 1960’s this concept was widely put down. 4 stroke engines have seen an enormous technological development sine then. Maybe you could make a good 2 stroke engine if you really used the technology of today."
db6f3d70,Do vegetarians have a higher risk of stroke than meat eaters?,"If you read the article, and the study upon which the article is based, you will easily be able to answer this question for yourself.
The article NEVER states that vegetarians are at a higher risk of stroke. It states that people with severe deficiencies in certain essential nutrients are at higher risk of stroke. Chief among these being B12 complex, and even then, neither the article nor the study explicitly state that B12 deficiency is the CAUSE of this increased risk.
I am a vegan, and I take B12 supplements because the vegan diet does not naturally contain B12. Anyone that tries to make huge dietary changes with zero prior research, is an idiot. You will get sick, and you will feel like garbage. If you go vegan or try any other non omnivorous lifestyle, you must take supplements, period."
63abdde9,"Can someone recover completely from a stroke? If yes, how long does it take for a person to recover from a stroke?","That is an impossible question to answer. Each stroke is different and in a room full of 100 stroke victims, no two strokes will have been the same. How much of the brain died? Where exactly did the brain cells die? Strokes aren’t a hit and it’s over. A stroke continues for 24–48 hours with more brain cells dying every minute.
I had a major ischemic stroke. My right side was totally paralyzed head to foot and my speech was gone. Despite the years of therapy, I have not had a complete recovery. I recovered my speech after some time and with speech therapy, it’s not the same as before. But! I’m so glad I have it! I had occupational and physical therapy in the hospital for six weeks then at home 6 days/week for most of the year. Therapy is ongoing, for me, for the rest of my life. So recoveries are all different too. But therapy is forever. Or you can lose some of your past gains.
So the question asks about a complete recovery but with no details of the initial damage and losses or the kind of therapy and whether it was begun immediately. No one can give you the kind of answer you are looking for. Hasn’t the doctor discussed the prognosis with you? He alone would have the information needed for that assessment.
I wish you or the patient the best of luck!"
4d4825d0,"If I saw a wild tiger or lion, would it attack me if I tried to stroke it?","Lions are much more social in general than tigers.
Their habitats are vastly different.
To the lion, you would show up from a much longer distance.
The tiger of course you would get fairly close to before you see it, but rest assured it knows where you are coming from. You’re still not likely to surprise a tiger in its own habitat.
Both will stare at you, for it is not unusual for either to have a human approach them. At this point in time, your intent to pet is not really relevant.
Your body language does play a role, and their curiosity may be piqued no matter what you do. If you don’t suddenly get scared and start to run, you may invite an immediate attack. This is purely instinctive.
The lion is a little more likely to see what you’re up to. If it is there, it rules there. Same with the tiger, but the tiger is a bit more shy, and might simply want to avoid you, and it can disappear very quickly. If you’re persistent and kept moving towards the lion, at one point, you’re going to cross the threshold of curiosity and step into the threat perception. One roar should be enough to paralyse you. If you do get paralysed, that may be your best chance to get out alive, for the lion may lose interest in you, and move off, a bit annoyed. If you’re not paralysed, the next step or two you take will be the last, no matter in which direction. I would very much doubt the lion is there alone, and there is very little more suicidal than taking on a pack of lionesses.
With the tiger, the most important thing, as advised by a tracker who I knew who was killed by a tiger, is to keep your eye contact. It won’t drop its gaze, and it will read your moves. Stare at it, stand still, and you might see it leave after many long minutes, for it may decide this is some unknown non food related intrusion. If it starts coming towards you with that crouching gait, I would bet you will react. One leap - 8 metres. I don’t think you will be in a petting position when it gets to you, paws extended to slap your head.

34b4a77a,What are the advantages and disadvantages of a 2-stroke engine?,"Advantages of 2-Stroke Engines
Two stroke engines do not have valves which are easy to construct and lowers their weight
Two stroke engines fire once every revolution. Power is produced once during 2 strokes of the piston .This gives a significant power boost.
This two stroke engines lower output in horse power
Two stroke engines can work in any position, since oil flow is not a concern with any valves to worry about.
2 stroke engines are lighter comparatively.
Since the power produced by the two-stroke engine is higher, these engines are small and compact in size.
The torque produced on the crankshaft is more uniform because the power is produced during every alternate stroke of the piston.
These Engines often provide high power-to-weight ratio, usually in a narrow range of rotational speeds called the “power band”.
Disadvantages of 2-Stroke Engines
Two stroke engines do not last as long as four stroke engines; there is no lubrication system in a two stroke engine so parts wear out a lot faster.
Two stroke oil is expensive; you would burn a gallon every 1000 miles if it were in a car
Two stroke engines are Less Efficient.
Two stroke engines produce a lot of pollution, and the way the engine is designed that part of the air/fuel leaks out of the chamber through the exhaust port.
The exhaust gases often get trapped inside the combustion chamber. This makes the fresh charge impure. Therefore maximum power doesn’t get delivered because of improper incomplete combustion.
Since in two-stroke engines power stroke is produced after every stroke, a large amount of heat is generated within them. To reduce the temperature of the engine and keep the moving parts well-lubricated, good lubrication and cooling systems for the engine are required."
9be210ce,What are the remedies for sun stroke?,"It may usually be apparent to doctors if you have heatstroke, but laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis, rule out other causes for your symptoms and assess organ damage.
Heatstroke treatment centers perform tasks on cooling your body to a normal temperature to prevent or reduce damage to your brain and vital organs.
Immerse you in cold water. A bath of cold or ice water has been proved to be the most effective way of quickly lowering your core body temperature. The quicker you can receive cold water immersion, the less risk of death and organ damage.
Use evaporation cooling techniques. If cold water immersion is unavailable, health care workers may try to lower your body temperature using an evaporation method. Cool water is misted on your body while warm air is fanned over you, causing the water to evaporate and cool your skin.
Pack you with ice (Never put ice above chest or axillary region, can induce a topical cold arrest of heart (stop the heart) which is not mentioned in their protocol) and cooling blankets. Another method is to wrap you in a special cooling blanket and apply ice packs to your groin, neck, back and armpits to lower your temperature.
Give you medications to stop your shivering. If treatments to lower your body temperature make you shiver, your doctor may give you a muscle relaxant, such as a benzodiazepine. Shivering increases your body temperature, making treatment less effective.

7a6a5562,"Which is more dangerous, an ischemic or a hemorrhage stroke?","All strokes cause brain damage. tPA can reduce damage from ischemic strokes. When I had a stroke, I was taken directly from the ambulance to the CT, where they told me I had a bleed in the brain. No tPA for me.
I’ve heard that survivors of ischemic stroke who had hemi-paralysis arriving at Emergency, and promptly received tPA then walked out of the hospital a few hours later. Amazing! I couldn’t take a step without falling for weeks. I fell in ER and in ICU. In rehab, I finally understood — alcoholics and addicts in rehab need to accept that they are powerless over their substance. I had to accept that I was powerless over my left side.
I was shocked to read (months later) that 40%–50% of hemorrhagic strokes are fatal within the first 30 days. The neurologist told my husband and daughter that if I survived the first night, I’d probably be ok. Thank goodness, I didn’t hear that! The neurologist said that blood is toxic to brain cells. The blood-brain barrier is why the brain is “grey matter”, not red. In my stroke, the blood flowed into one of the ventricles, so the damage to my grey matter was limited.
I’ve read that hemorrhagic stroke is more common in younger people. In this context “young” means under 60. That made me smile — it has been quite a while since anyone said I was young. :)
Exercise almost every day. Don’t smoke. Manage your blood pressure and cholesterol. Avoiding a stroke is far better than surviving any type of stroke."
585e6011,Is there a way for a person to fully recover from a stroke?,"It's going to be according to what was damaged in the brain- what areas and how badly- how soon and how much therapy a person receives, and how able they are to utilize the therapy they receive.
A stroke can cause massive damage to the brains, killing whole swathes of brain tissue and, generally, neurons don't grow back. ( Page on jneurosci.org
) So, if the clot or bleed which caused the CVA (cerebral vascular accident) was big, full recovery may be impossible.
If both drug and physical/occupational/speech therapies are started immediately, stroke victims can recover a surprising amount of functioning; surprising for the state in which they were brought in to the Emergency Room, anyway. Clot-busting drugs along with blood thinners help to clear away lingering debris in the brain's circulatory system and also keep a good, steady flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients in to the damaged area. That helps tremendously.
The therapies mentioned above, though, are less efficacious if the damage is severe. PT, which usually focuses on physical strengthening of an affected body part and overall conditioning, and OT, which focuses on every day tasks and abilities, don't do a person who is completely right-side paralyzed much good until the brain heals a bit from the insult of the stroke. There are improvements, certainly, but until the brain starts re-routing itself around damaged areas, these therapies are mostly a holding pattern. Same with speech therapy, although it is speech, with its emphasis on cognition, which can get the ball really rolling. Real improvement starts to be seen about week 3 post CVA, with continued improvement for about 18 months. After that, a plateau is usually reached, and few people can afford to continue the intensive therapy needed to see further improvement.
Two and three years later, there can be little improvement in functional abilities, although strength in musculature can help minimize deficits.
I'm sorry your friend has had to go through this, and will continue with this disability for the rest of her life. The best thing you can do now is to treat her as a friend, help her when she requests it, and not allow her deficits to cause you to see her as someone to be pitied. No one gains from pity."
248fbe93,Could vertigo be a sign of stroke?,"Isolated vertigo is the most common vertebrobasilar warning symptom before stroke11,44; it is rarely diagnosed correctly as a vascular symptom at first contact. Strokes causing dizziness or vertigo will have limb ataxia or other focal signs. The most common causes of vertigo are inner ear infections or diseases of the ear such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, and Meniere's disease. BPPV can occur when calcium builds up in canals of the inner ear, causing brief dizziness that lasts from 20 seconds to one minute. Ellen Johnson"
eaa759ec,Do stroke survivors die earlier in life than those who haven't suffered a stroke?,"Usually yes. A stroke is caused by a burst blood vessel or a clot blocking an artery. A stroke may kill someone itself and it does not have to be simply damaging a critical area. The ruptured blood vessel is most commonly caused by high blood pressure but the risk is increased by smoking, diabetes and other issues. Clots can be caused by irregular heart beat atrial fibrillation and narrowing of neck arteries which is in turn caused by the same issues causing heart disease eg smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol. The point to this answer is that the causes of the stroke kill people and need to be addressed. One of my patients - a young lady in her 40’s who is very healthy was developing a massive stroke after she had a chiropractic treatment of her neck. Fortunately someone else - not the chiro- spotted it and took her to hospital where she received clot busting drugs that probably saved her life and certainly stopped a stroke which was already affecting her speech, and paralyzed the entire left side. She has fully recovered."
3de61d6f,Do most people that have strokes lose the languages they've learned?,"OK, this will have to be broken down much more than in the question.
Most people do not have strokes.
If you have a stroke, then some brain function is usually lost. But the rest of the brain still functions as usual. Much of the brain is simply motor control—control of your muscles—and this is a much more common problem than language problems after a stroke.
Brain function does not relate directly to specific knowledge. You will never have a stroke that specifically deleted everything you learned at age 13, or that deleted everything you know about history. (Unless it is so severe that all memory function is affected.)
If the brain function you lose is in the areas of the brain that process language, you might lose some language function. You might lose the ability to read, you might lose the ability to name persons (but not to recognise them; this happened to a neighbour of mine who knew very well who I was, and could hold quite coherent conversations about something in our past, but could never recall my name), you might lose the connection between colours and the words for them. You might lose a second language, but you might also lose your first language, while retaining the second language. And a very rare condition is that you suddenly start speaking your first language with a heavy, foreign accent
. The brain really does work in so strange ways that you cannot predict what will happen.
If you have lost knowledge because the corresponding brain circuits are destroyed, you might or might not be able to learn the skills again. If your stroke gives you instant and complete dyslexia, you are unlikely to recover. My neighbour learned the names of his family again, probably by some sort of mnemonics, possibly subconscious. You might have to learn your second language from scratch, but if your first language is unaffected, this will most likely be possible for you.
You will have no fundamental difficulties learning anything else, unless the stroke was so large that your short-term or long-term memory is severely affected. (In rare cases, the connection between short-term and long-term memory is destroyed completely, and the victim will not even be able to realise that time passes
. This might be what you refer to when you say “never learn anything again”. But this is rare.) You can lose a second language and still be able to learn to ride a bicycle, or ancient history. Although in these cases, you have probably also lost motor function, and regaining that will usually be your first priority."
6aaaf35b,"What is the possibility that President Trump will have a heart attack, stroke or other disabling ailment before his current term expires?","As a nurse with 30 years’ experience, and having heard so much about his food preferences, complete lack of knowledge about human physiology, his own strange beliefs about health, lack of exercise, sedentary life, and hair trigger temper, I know there’s no reason he SHOULD be alive now.
His doctor admitted falsifying the information from his physical, from his weight to his b/p, etc.
He clearly appears to be obese, almost certainly has substantial hypertension, probably some fairly advanced cardiac disorder, pre-diabetic and high cholesterol.
His favorite foods are giant cheeseburgers, oversized french fries, and ice cream sundaes in amounts almost anyone would find staggering.
For those of you who come from cultures where a healthy digestive system is seen to be the key to health (Italians, Indians…others too many to mention) do you think this guy is constipated?
Being constipated goes beyond the present discomfort of having old, rock hard food lodged in your intestines. Many people die while straining to have a BM. Most are already in the same condition he is, and the strain of trying to move the mass can cause a stroke or fatal MI. Remember Trump’s pal, Roger Ailes, who believed he, too, as head of Fox “news”thought health guidelines didn’t apply to him? Or even poor Elvis?
He believes humans are only allotted so many heartbeats per lifetime, which is why he says he doesn’t exercise.
There’s no reason he shouldn’t have had some serious health problems already. We all know how it is, though. Your friend who never smoked gets lung cancer at 35 and dies at 36. Smoking, drinking, obese people with the world’s worst diet sometimes will live to be 85.
It’s hard to say, since he already has so many risk factors in place, yet nothing’s happened (that we know of). He’s just a physiological time bomb waiting to explode."
4a8f78f8,Why must a two stroke engine always have an intake pressure boost?,"Because a 2 cycle engine takes in air at the bottom of the stroke, there is little to no vacuum to draw air in.
Large 2 cycle diesels use a blower (supercharger) or turbocharger, or both, to force air into the cylinder during the short time the ports are open in the cylinder.
Small 2 stroke engines usually take in the fuel/air mixture through the crankcase. When the cylinder comes down, it pressurizes the mixture in the crankcase because the reed valve between the crankcase and the carburetor closes with the pressure. The pressure in the crankcase forces the mixture through the intake port in the base of the cylinder.
So both engines use pressure to charge the cylinder, one uses the small amount of pressure in the crankcase, the other uses more pressure from a mechanical blower."
d89e65f8,"Why are two strokes engines with direct injection not used in cars, since they're more efficient than four strokes engine?","Your basic premise of the question is incorrect. 2-strokes are NOT more efficient than 4-strokes counterparts in burning fuel for every unit of power production.
The reason for this lies into the higher overlap a 2-stroke engine has in each working phase of an IC engine - particularly the exhaust and intake phases.
If you are talking about spatial efficiency, it's not a concern as performance bottleneck is usually the tire grip rather than engine power.

Why two strokes engines with direct injection are not used in cars, since they're more efficient than four strokes engine?"
520bab54,What is the difference between a 4 stroke engine and a 4 cylinder engine?,"Don't confuse the two things with 4 as a figure
Let's start from scratch at utter novice level. Some may find my answer absurd.
Consider you have a cylinder , A cylinder is geometrical figure that is obtained from a rectangle by rolling in a way that one of the parallel edges meet the other.
In a cylinder we have a piston.
Consider something like plunger, a rod having a circle at top
This Piston fits into the cylinder, just like legs in slim fit jeans.
This piston moves up and down in a cylinder from the top to bottom and vice versa.
The Top to bottom and bottom to Top movement makes it one stroke.
Therefore, strokes occur in a cylinder.

In a 4 stroke engine, it takes 4 strokes or 4 top to bottom and bottom to top movements to complete a combustion process.
A 4 cylinder engine is nothing but 4 different cylinders used for combustion.
These four cylinders have piston which does 4 stroke to complete a combustion."

9aeffd39,Can chiropractic adjustments induce stroke?,"I don’t know where the other two answers got their information, other than perhaps anecdotally. The FACTS are that the likelihood of a person having a stroke in a chiropractor’s office are no greater than having one in a medical doctor’s office. A Review of the Literature Regarding
Stroke
and Chiropractic
The myth that chiropractors cause strokes is (1) based upon a misunderstanding of the difference between correlation and causation, and (2) by the American Medical Association’s organized effort to destroy an honorable profession whose philosophy is to avoid drugs and surgery by finding and correcting the underlying cause of a health issue. (The latter was validated by a Federal Court finding the AMA guilty of those charges.)
Look, the malpractice insurance premiums paid by chiropractors to insurance companies is orders of magnitude less expensive than premiums paid by medical doctors. Do you think those companies are just being nice, or is it more likely that more people are hurt and/or die in the hands of medical doctors? How do the critics explain that???
The elephant in the room is a recent study by John Hopkins University which concluded that on average 250,000 people die EVERY YEAR IN THE USA due to “iatrogenic causes,” meaning incorrect medical diagnosis or treatment. QUOTE: “ Analyzing medical death rate data over an eight-year period, Johns Hopkins patient safety experts have calculated that more than 250,000 deaths per year are due to medical error in the U.S. Their figure, published May 3 in The BMJ, surpasses the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's third leading cause of death—respiratory disease, which kills close to 150,000 people per year.” Johns Hopkins study suggests medical errors are third-leading cause of death in U.S.
And yet, if even one person dies while receiving chiropractic treatment (which is not the same as being CAUSED by chiropractic treatment) it’s front page news.
Open your eyes people. Health, in many cases, comes from identifying and correcting the underlying cause of disease not from a bottle of pills or removal of organs."

His batting is based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to geniuses - anticipation. If he doesn't have a signature stroke - the upright, back-foot punch comes close - it is because he is equally proficient at each of the full range of orthodox shots (and plenty of improvised ones as well) and can pull them out at will.

9ffa4f84,Why would President Trump lie about having a stroke?,"For the same reason he wears a girdle and elevator shoes. It’s the same reason he told his doctor to sign a letter proclaiming him “the healthiest” person who would ever be president. It’s the same reason he refuses to wear a mask (which would smear his makeup) or a walk in the rain without an umbrella (which would flatten his comb-over). President Trump is obsessed with looking good in public. To the point where his efforts become ridiculous, and he either doesn’t realize it, or doesn’t care.
I don’t want to try and diagnose Trump’s emotional state from afar, but everything we know about him suggests that he was raised in an environment in which project an image of power and control was inherent, and showing any sign of weakness was swiftly either punished or used against you. It’s clear that he sees that as the proper structure of the world: a constant battle, and anyone who you can take out must have deserved it. And that’s not an accusation, as much as an observation: he’s said as much about both his businesses and his administration: he likes to pit people against one another and see who comes out on top,
For that reason, he has a constant and pathological need to pretend that he’s smarter, stronger, more informed, even taller than he is. You see that in his constant self-aggrandizing lies and assertions, you see that in the way he dresses and grooms and presents himself, you see it in the constant attempts to display dominance over other people.
The reality of his aging and ill health isn’t just an unfortunate fact of life, to someone like Trump. It’s a failure that he has to keep under wraps, because he assumes it will be used against him (that is, after all, exactly what he would do to anyone else who had ill health). And so he does what he always does: he lies, he denies, he deflects, he makes up ridiculous and obviously false stories. And most people see right through all of that, but to some core who want to believe in him, well, they can believe just about anything. So, if President says he just decided to, on whim, to put together a motorcade and pop ’round for an unscheduled visit to the hospital, because he felt like getting a jump on his annual physical, well, that’s good enough for me! And if he then, unprompted, starts tweeting that he definitely did not have a series of minor strokes, well, what more do you want? He said “not”!"

49a91fb8,"Was Stalin actually a good person, but strokes destroyed him later?","The Western elites despise socialism. The reason is because it threatens their wealth and power. Demonizing political enemies is routinely done. For example, Edward Snowden exposed the vast surveillance state used to spy on Americans by the U.S. government. The surveillance apparatus is colossal. Yet Snowden is vilified in the media as a traitor, a snitch, etc. The same applies to figures like Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning, and other whistleblowers and journalists.
Within 40 years, the Soviet Union went from an illiterate, semi-feudal, peasant agrarian economy to defeating the Nazis, becoming the world’s second largest industrial power, electrifying the nation, and by 1958, winning the Space Race, having launched Sputnik, the world’s first artificial satellite.
The architect of much of this success was a man known by the name of Joseph Stalin. Because he could not be defeated militarily, he had to be vilified. The West has a very formulaic playbook. Sexual predator, pedophile, mass murderer, or racist. If you are a successful socialist, it isn’t long before you are accused of one or all of these things by the West—falsely.
Enter, Robert Conquest. Conquest was literally a government propagandist for the British government.[1] Early in his career, he would write propaganda articles and these would be disseminated to the major media outlets.[2] Conquest is the author of the early anti-Stalin and anti-Soviet books dressed up as “historical works.”
He wasn’t alone. Goebbels was even more effective. It was his notion to lie about the famine in the Ukraine to instead claim it was deliberately caused by Stalin.[3] It wasn’t. [4] And we have the historical documents to prove it, even though Khrushchev did his best to destroy as much exculpatory evidence helping Stalin as possible. Khrushchev hated Stalin because Khrushchev’s son murdered someone and was on trial. Khrushchev asked Stalin to intervene. But the son was guilty as hell, so Stalin refused. Khrushchev also used Stalin as a scapegoat to consolidate his own power with the older members of the nomenklatura.
Stalin was still “with it” in older age. In fact, he was working to introduce new and younger members of the Party to help refresh the ossified leadership in its ranks. As usual, the seriousness of the threat posed by internal enemies was downplayed as “paranoia” by the Western media. In fact, Stalin was apparently not paranoid enough, considering he was ultimately murdered by Beria, his second in command.[5] You aren’t paranoid if people are actually working to kill you. Stalin also had previously survived many attempts on his life.
Was he a good person? Yes, he was. He chose socialism because he really believed in it. In fact, he was kicked out of the seminary program he was in for spreading Marxist literature. [6] He believed all people should be truly free.
His daughter said he was warmer to her than her mother. He loved deeply. In fact, he was suicidal after his first wife died, such that his friends took his pistol away, for fear he might kill himself.
He was a good person. We must look at his life within the context of his time. He grew up and rose to power in the midst of an extremely violent and turbulent time. If you look at the actual historical records, you begin to see the portrait of a man who is far more complex, more warm, and less cartoonishly evil than the Western elites would have us believe.
Today, Stalin has an approval rating in Russia of 70%. [7]

c91a303d,Which vehicle has a 6-stroke engine? How does it work?,"Till now there is no application which uses 6 T engine
But i will explain you the working .
It will have the common four strokes of the existing engine models i.e Suction,compression,Ignition,Exhaust
But at end of the 4 th stroke some of the exhaust gases will be retained cylinder.
On 5 th stroke water will be injected into the system .
Due to high temp that is 200+ C at cylinder from exhaust gases the water will suddenly expand to superheated stage and an force is exerted on the piston .
This gives an power stroke and aon next stroke the vapours are sent out through exhaust.
This requires large flywheel as the no of idle stroke increases."

If it’s a congenital coarctation malformation,Aortic stenosis, aneurism or aortic stricture it can cause areas of restricted or pooled blood flow. Technically yes anytime you slow dwell time in blood vessels tiny emboli can develop. In the case of the Aorta it can cause emboli to get thrown up the carotid artery and cause strokes (Aka emboli or embolic showers) in the brain. Often if this is discovered it’s highly recommended to take long term anticoagulants. Surgery or minimal invasive procedures are often recommended.
I want to stress that although concerning, this kind of disease can be well monitored managed and followed up on. You may need to see one or more specialists. Find a good health provider doctor,nurse practitioner or physicians assistant and start with a full health physical H&P (history and physical exam) People can live long relatively healthy lives with Aortic arch problems."
82d2ba3f,How does a two stroke petrol engine work?,"The 2 stroke engine performs the following steps – suction, compression, expansion & exhaust; but the 2 stroke engine performs these all steps in only 2 stroke unlike the 4 stroke engine which completes one power cycle in 4 strokes.
The parts which a 2 stroke engine has –
Piston – In an engine, piston is used to transfer the expanding force of gases to mechanical rotation of crankshaft via a connecting rod. The piston is able to do this because it is secured tightly within cylinder using piston rings to minimize the clearance between cylinder and piston.
Crankshaft – A crankshaft is a part which is able to convert the reciprocating motion to rotational motion.
Connecting rod – A connecting rod transfers motion from a piston to crankshaft which acts as a lever arm.
Inlet & Outlet ports – It allows to enter fresh air with fuel & to exit the spent air-fuel mixture from the cylinder.
Spark Plug – A spark plug delivers electric current to the combustion chamber which ignites the air-fuel mixture leading to abrupt expansion of gas.
Working of 2 stroke engine :-
Down Stroke :- First the piston is moved downside from TDC to BDC to let the fresh air enter into the combustion chamber. The fresh air-fuel mixture gets into the combustion chamber through crankcase. Crankshaft rotation – 180°
Up Stroke :- Here happens all the magic. The piston is pushed up from BDC to TDC. The fuel-air mixture gets compressed & spark plug ignites the mixture. As the mixture gets expanded, the piston moves down. During up stroke, the inlet port is opened. While this inlet port is opened, the mixture gets sucked inside the crankcase. When the mixture is pushed up into the combustion chamber during the previous up stroke, a partial vacuum is created as no mixture is left behind in the crankcase.This mixture is ready to go into the combustion chamber during down stroke but remains in the crankcase until the piston goes up till TDC. Crankshaft rotation – 360°
Two strokes get completed along with one power cycle.
From the 2nd down stroke onwards the exhaust gases get expelled out from one side while a fresh mixture enters into the combustion chamber simultaneously due to partial vacuum created in the combustion chamber after removal of exhaust gases. This is the beauty of the engine. Both things happen at the same time which makes it a 2 stroke engine."

Not all vitamin E is the same. Most studies that diss vitamin E only use small doses of the weaker and synthetic, single-type. alpha-tocopherol. You want a high quality one or make sure you’re eating organic, foods rich in a spectrum of natural vitamin E types (eg: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta).
Taurine: Not a vitamin, but rather a conditionally deficient amino acid in some individuals and a powerful neuroprotective and proven
factor in preventing ischemic stroke. It’s actually used by veterinarians to prevent stroke and treat seizures in animals.
Magnesium - A key mineral most of us are missing and AKA Mother Nature’s muscle relaxer. In fact, Magnesium Taurate (see previous entry) is a popular supplement for those with migraine headaches.
NAC (N-acetyl cysteine)
, again, an amino-acid. A daily dose of NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) was found to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, including ischemic stroke and heart attack, by 40% compared to placebo in people with end-stage renal failure (a high-risk group).
Folate (but NOT folic-Acid - a common point of confusion). Specifically L-5-MTHF and 6S-5-MTHF﻿ (such as Quatrefolic [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid). Of course, food-sources of Folate are even better.
Fish Oil (Omega 3s)

5d970210,Who plays the best forehand strokes in tennis?,"I’ll go with Federer’s assessment:
Roger Federer reckons Rafael Nadal has the best forehand in the world
There has never been a forehand like Nadal's, and there never will be.
Why?
Because like Federer's forehand before it, it really was/is groundbreaking to tennis, in more than one way.
Through the combination of a lighter racquet, a tinier grip, polyester string technology, and superior reproducible technique, the usual limits of the forehand were breached by Federer in 2004, and then improved and taken forward by Nadal in 2005, making them two of the most successful players ever, in terms of career prize money.
Here are the main factors by which Nadal's forehand is groundbreaking:
Top-spin rate
Net Clearance
Angular bounce off the court.
Technique and Effect: Nadal, with a tiny, semi-western grip
, uses all his extending arm's force to send the ball spinning at destructive rates—depending on what he needs in the moment—which bounces off the surface on the other side of the net, so much so that it can reach as high as 6 feet on the opponent's baseline!
This combination of power and spin is unrivaled in the sport.
There are guys who can hit the ball harder than Nadal, and there are guys who can the spin the ball like him too, but none can get the golden balance of both assets—of spin and power—like he does.
This is the reason guys 5 years older than him couldn't beat him (even on a hard court) when he burst onto the scene in 2004, as a 17 year-old.
They, simply, hadn't ever dealt with something like this before.
Until then, the guy with the best forehand was a certain Roger Federer, who could put around 3000 r.p.m.(an abbreviation for ""revolutions per minute"") on a ball—if he was feeling like toying with an opponent, instead of going for aggressive, flatter shots that finished off the opponent faster.
Yet, his shots never bounced as high as Nadal's, or cleared the net as high as Nadal's, because he usually hit the ball at a different angle and followed through across his shoulder, causing a flatter, faster trajectory.
Which is why he is a better fast court player than Nadal.
Federer used his anomalous topspin from the baseline, when he wasn't red-lining his usually-aggressive style, and won matches even when he wasn't at his ""flattened-out-shot"" best, unruffled in the long rallies, and unmatched from the baseline.
In those golden 2004-2007 years, he was the best defender when he needed to be, which is a fact many laymen overlook, because he was later overshadowed in the defensive department by Djokovic, Murray, and Nadal, who took the running-around-and-retrieving aspect a bit further.
Federer's attacking game at that time, was among the best, if not the best.
But when Nadal came onto the scene in 2004, with his even-more-anomalous forehand, which had him hitting the ball at a higher angle, and following through behind his shoulder, in a bolo-whip finish (showing how much more spin he tries to generate), analysts measured one that went up as high as 4900 r.p.m!
Also, since his forehand ball looped so high, it was never in danger of clipping the net.
Here's a graphic showing how much higher Nadal's forehand clears the net than the other top players of his era. Also, it shows the top-spin-rate of the shot in the other column.
By around 2007, it was generally accepted that Nadal had taken over Federer as the best defender and best counter-attacker (and best attacker on clay) in modern tennis, just because his forehand ameliorated his game so well.
Nadal's game wasn't based on easy points — since he doesn't possess a powerful serve to achieve that like any of his peers, Federer, Murray, and Djokovic — but rather, on precise placement of a slower slice-serve, and then the ensuing big forehand to extract a weaker reply, giving him free reign to hit more forehands from corner to corner, bullying his opponent—until he unleashes his flattened-out, killing forehand.
When he returns a ball from his opponent, his bouncy, high-looping groundstrokes, that take longer to fly through the court than your average flat groundstroke, gave him the precious time to recover his balance, from his own shot, and allowed him to take their consequent shot with renewed readiness.
And since the opponent's shot was taken with considerable difficulty, considering they had to hit it at an abnormal height, the quality of their reply was never up to their usual standards.
Hence, he had many an opportunity to run around his backhand on an opponent’s weak parry, to hit another forehand, if his opponent wasn't very good at adjusting to the high balls generated by his forehand.
The high ball also pushed the opponent backwards, and didn't give them an aggressive position in the rally, and they were left gasping from the effort of keeping up with his punishing multiple-forehand barrage.
You'll see him running around his back-hand here, in his gaudy pirate pants:
Federer's amazing forehand could give you those ""OMG"" moments on the rare occasion, but Nadal's forehand is the ultimate weapon: studiously pegging away on every point, with nary as much effort used, due to his tiny-grip mechanics.
Ostensibly tame and defensive, but subtly sapping the opponents's strength with its topspin, and eventually when he senses the opponent is at a negative position, he lets it out at its wholly-aggressive ""OMG"" ferocity, for the flatter, killing blow (which is shown by the across-the-shoulder followthrough)
This process is called 'intuitive physics"" or the ability to construct a point around the part where you can unleash your 'fear' shot, to finish it off.
This is a trait he shares with most elite players, especially the ones with the best forehands (The Physics of Federer-Nadal | Big Think
)
Though this next video may have nothing to do with constructing a point, it certainly shows the versatility of Nadal with his forehand. He can do it at a sprint, just as effectively, unlike powerful hitters like Berdych and Del Potro, who need more balance to optimize their shots.
Look at the point at 14:54-15:20.
At the end of a long, disappointing 2011 season, in which Djokovic had ripped Nadal’s heart out at the 6 big events they contested that year, this match was one of Nadal's toughest best-of-five clay court matches.
He lost the first set 1-6, in front of his home crowd in the Davis Cup final.
I don't know if you're familiar with Nadal's prowess on clay, but the fans and team-mates watching in the stadium were noticeably stunned into silence that the King of Clay was losing on clay.
In this point: Nadal sponges the pressure off 2 powerful groundies from Del Potro, after which the Argentine finds himself hoping he can finish the seemingly-overwhelmed Nadal off on the empty part of the court, with a strategically-placed backhand on Nadal's forehand side.
But Nadal wings it, and produces a spectacular, running forehand winner that gives Verdasco (the Spanish team-mate cheering after the point) bittersweet memories of this:
Yeah, OMG.
(I'm going to start calling Nadal's forehand The Fearhand, like Brad Gilbert does, just because it deserves it.)
Once The Fearhand was displayed in all its glory, most opponents just gave up, out of the sheer Sisyphean nature of the task of keeping up with the powerful, high ball he generated. Nadal had deconstructed the great Federer's game by, very simply, directing it towards Federer's weaker backhand, and when he overtook Federer as the best player of the decade, most epically and visibly in 2008, all of them just stopped believing that beating him at peak level was possible—until 2011.
Also, like I mentioned somewhere above, in anticipation of the famous Fedfan snobs, it's not like he hits loopy, defensive forehands all the time.
Unlike his 1990s predecessor Sergi Bruguera (who also could average his forehand at around 3,300 r.p.m), he could adjust the forehand to the hard-courts and grass-courts as well.
He's flattened it out when he's needed to, based on the environment, like on those faster lower-bouncing courts at Wimbledon and New York.
It was generally accepted that he had evolved into an all-court player by September 2010, when he won the US Open and became the youngest man to win a career slam set, beating Hardcourt G.O.A.T. Novak in the final. After that match, people no longer though of him as just the best defender in tennis, but the top man, who would defeat anyone on any surface if he was 100% fit.
Here's Nadal practising a few of his aggressive, flat forehands, which he used to win the hard-court Indian Wells 2013, and much more, in his insane 2013 comeback season. (Expert text inserts by a tennis instructor, in an otherwise boring video; Nadal usually hits more flat forehands in practice)
The Fearhand is the reason Nadal is Nadal, the great 17-slam wonder—otherwise he would just be another great defensive baseliner like Bruguera, Ferrer, Hewitt or Chang, who could never translate their defensive success into immortality.
Yes, Chang and Hewitt are hall-of-famers, but they haven't dominated tennis as long as their aggressive, top-spinning baseliner cousins, Borg and Nadal. Most tennis masters (like Sampras, Agassi, Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic) have to have a top shot that is both defensive and aggressive and Nadal's forehand is the best you can get, on both aspects of the game, because of its raw power, anomalous top-spin, and net-safety factor.
No one could handle it over best-of-five matches until Djokovic's acrobatic two-handed backhand and superior conditioning peaked in 2011, and even then, not so emphatically.
The Fearhand was an evolutionary step-up in the sport: it's like possessing Charles Atlas' body for Olympic swimming, at the turn of the 20th Century; like having Ronaldinho's ball-sticking-to-body skills in European club football in the 2000s; like successfully controlling Sachin's heavier bat in the 1990s limited overs cricket era; or, most aptly, like having Sampras' serve on nonclay courts in the 1990s era, and as far as I can see, no man will ever emulate it, out of fear of hurting himself."

For a 4 cyl, it might appear that Cyl #1 and #4 are firing together and cyl #3 and #2 are firing in the next stroke, but they fire individually (Even though they fire off a single Ignition coil in popular -2003 models)
A few follow 1-3-4-2 as well
In Line L6 again follow a similar profile of 1-5-3-6-2-4
V6 typically follow 1-2-3-4-5-6
V8 and further do not adhere to a single thumbs rule.
There is a huge variety in firing order. Infact, us mechanics too look up for the firing order for individual vehicles.
Having said that, with newer 'Coil on Plug' design on all the later than 2003 makes, it hardly matters what the firing order is. The firing sequence is determined by the ECU and it fires just right. (It even gets additional feed-back from those nasty Heated Oxygen Sensors at exhaust to determine whether the firing is rich or poor)"
93ad626f,"Which is faster, a 4 cylinder 2 stroke 50hp outboard or a 4 cylinder 4 stroke 50?","50 horsepower is 50 horsepower. Horsepower is the amount of work being done.
That being said, different engines have different power curves, and one might be ""peakier"" than another. In a car, they might be geared differently, which could affect performance - furthermore, different transmissions have different levels of efficiency at transferring power - so that too will have an affect on performance.
Torque doesn't particularly matter in terms of performance capability, as long as the engine is geared to use the power band well.
For example, if an engine produces 100 lb-ft of torque, maximum, and it does this at 2000 RPMs to make 38 horsepower, if you had another 38 horsepower engine that produced only 50lb-ft of torque at peak power levels, it would do this at 4000 RPMs.
In terms of driving a car, the second car would be just as fast as the first, as long as the gearing was equivalent. A transmission acts as a torque multiplier. If your engine is producing 100lb-ft of torque at 2000 RPMs (38HP), and you have a 1:1 transmission, you have 100lb-ft of torque at the wheels (I'm oversimplifying slightly). Compare to the 50lb-ft engine at 4000 RPMs - which also equals 38HP. To acheive the same performance, you would use a 2:1 transmission, which would increase torque output at the wheels, to, you guessed it, 100lb-ft.
My previous car had an engine that generated 197 horsepower at 7800RPM. My current car has an engine that generated 210 horsepower at 5000 RPM. It weighs about the same. But there are two huge differences between the two: torque and gearing.
My old car made 139lb-ft of torque at 6000 RPMs, whereas my current one makes about 260lb-ft of torque at 2400 RPMs. The new car makes a lot more power than the old one did at lower RPMs (You might have guessed that the old car didn't have a turbocharger and my new one does). So if you compared the old car to the new one at the same RPMs, my new one is far more powerful - indeed, even with different gearing, it is significantly quicker without revving the engine up. But the difference isn't quite as much as the torque numbers indicate.
My old car had a transmission that was optimized for the less torquey engine. So, in every day driving, I didn't use the same RPM range I do on the new car. In my new car, I cruise on surface streets around 1400-2000 RPMs, and in traffic, for slightly aggressive acceleration I might hit 3000-3500 RPMs without using full throttle. In my old car, I would shift closer to 5500 RPMs for slightly aggressive acceleration.
My new car's engine makes more power - and it makes significantly more power through most of the RPM range. But when I used the old car at its peak performance level, maintaining 6000-8000 RPMs, it was nearly as fast as my current car.
As for gearing, second gear in my new car is essentially the same as third gear in my old car - roughly 100 RPMs per MPH. Sixth gear (top gear in both cars), had my old car at 3000 RPMs at 67MPH, and my new car a bit under 2000 RPMs at the same speed. My old engine produced ~120lb-ft of torque at 3000 RPMs, which gave me about 74 horsepower on tap, whereas my new car makes about 200lb-ft of torque at 2000 RPMs, which gives me... 76 horsepower. The old car was juuuuust about the same on the highway if I just leaned on it, in spite of the torque advantage of my new car. But come 2400 RPMs, my new car's output is up to 119HP, whereas my old car was only producing 82HP at 3600 RPM.
The biggest real world difference is that I don't need to work my new car as hard as I did the old one to get the same level of performance. The biggest difference? My new car is much quieter than my old one!
The torque curve on the different engines, combined with any transmission they are attached to, would dictate the real world performance difference between them.
Lastly, simply stating that because you need to run one engine faster than another does not dictate that it would be more or less reliable than the other option. My new car's engine is reputed to be significantly less reliable than my old car's engine was. Mind you, these are both 4 stroke engines, but they were designed differently and it happens to be that the other car with a more high strung engine actually had the more reliable engine of the two."
c61428cb,Can I do back arm shoulder press with a bad disc in my neck?,"So long as you maintain good strict form and if necessary you provide external support to avoid further injury. Make sure to take care of sensitive areas and build strength in surrounding muscles to help support your bodies internal structures. Using a machine will likely give better support as it is a more strict form of movement, requiring less stabilization and reducing your need for spreading stresses over other areas of your body. If it hurts stop and find an alternate movement to work the desired muscles."
5864ce48,Should two-stroke engines be forgotten?,"I’m betting that when you think of a two-stroke engine you are thinking of this
Two-stroke gasoline engines in street motorcycles and cars have long gone extinct in many countries. They stay only in the smallest of bikes, off road machines, and in places where emissions regulations and enforcement haven’t yet caught up. They aren’t quite forgotten, but they are getting there.
Two-stroke engines in small power tools, like weed trimmers, still persist, mostly because they are much lighter and cheaper than comparable 4-stroke motors. They are losing ground to electric motors there, though.
The thing is, there are other two-stroke motors that are alive and well, and not likely to go away any time soon.
This is a two-stroke diesel engine. It is a little different from the motorcycle two-stroke in that it has a separate oiling system, but it still is a two-stroke.
Two-stroke diesels are commonly used to run pumps and generators.
This house-sized monster is also a two-stroke diesel. It is a Wärtsilä marine engine used to drive large container ships.
These ships will be around for years yet. There is some movement to switch from diesel fuel to liquefied natural gas, but the engines consuming LNG are also two-stroke.
We shouldn’t be forgetting two-strokes just yet."
5be7e548,Is there any solid proof that President Donald Trump had a mini-stroke?,"No.
But he does exhibit symptoms that are consistent with TIAs, as well as a handful of other neuro-cognitive conditions.
No one can definitely make a diagnosis without doing the appropriate tests (strokes can be seen on MRI, even years later.)
One telling issue is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment that Trump bragged about recently (he took it in 2017.) The fact that he was asked to take it in the first place is shocking (or maybe he demanded it because he thought it could prove something unrelated about his mental acuity.) He talked about how he could remember the words [person, woman, man, camera, tv] as though any rational, thinking person would believe him.
When you look up the MoCA, the 5 words you’re asked to remember are not related to each other. They’re random, like [face velvet church red papaya.] Trump was GIVEN those 5 words recently because they are easy FOR HIM SPECIFICALLY to remember. The first 3 are describing the same thing, and the last 2 are relevant to him personally as a guy who was once the host of a series. Those would would NEVER have been on a real MoCA test.
Trump had to get help to pass a test that evaluates for severe cognitive impairment, and no one in the media will say so. Failing to point that out has given Trump’s story a false sense of validity."
7f12e2f0,Is it possible to reverse the damage from a stroke?,"Yes and no: What died has died … but you can train another part of the brain to take over some or all of that area’s function. The field of Occupational Therapy specializes in helping people become functional again, post stroke.
If you only had a TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) you didn’t lose blood supply long enough to the area to cause permanent damage. Those cells have recovered from a “mini-stroke” by themselves.
If you arrive in the ER with stroke symptoms WITHIN 4 HOURS (4–6??), they can give you a CLOTBUSTER (TPA) or Streptokinase to dissolve the clot and restore circulation and save the dying brain tissue. In that case, you have a complete recovery because you acted on it immediately."
f3670d27,"What wears out a petrol engine the most, ignition or compression stroke?","I don’t know that it works like that.
The passage of the rings up and down the bore will create almost exactly the same friction on each stroke. A little while after top dead centre there will be a lateral thrust against the translation in the gudgeon pin, but that must be more or less exactly the same in compression on the way up and ignition on the way down, even thought it is applied to the opposite faces. I don’t know that you can spot a brighter wear pattern on either east or west faces.
The main bearing thrusts average out with rotation, the big ends would drive on opposite faces during compression and ignition.
I rather think that the design engineers have equalised all this out, and the symmetries in the Carnot cycle probably have really equivalence in wear on the engine.
I suspect that any difference might be undetectable, and certainly not significant"
88db3fa0,What lifestyle habits minimize the risk of a stroke?,"Staying healthy overall will help minimize the risk of a stroke some healthy habits you can add to your daily routine include walking/getting your heart rate up and moving for more than 45 minutes a day, drinking enough water so your pee is a light yellow instead of dark yellow, adding a cup of fruit and a cup of vegetables to each meal, and replacing meat with fruits, vegetables or starches like rice and potatoes. All of these healthy habits you can add to your routine will help to minimize the risk of a stroke and keep you healthy and living longer. :) if you are trying to find exercises that are great for a healthy heart some may include swimming, running, and jump roping. I would also recommend standing for at least an hour while doing work instead of sitting to keep your blood moving. ;)"

Both were a supposed response to Big Sean's diss in his song “No More Interviews” in which Big Sean calls Kendrick out on his being “The God MC” or “The Savior of Rap”. The no more interviews rap goes like this:
“And I'm just not impressed by you niggas rapping fast
Who sound like one big asthma attack but trash when I’m rapping it back”
Who you put in your top five and claim they the savior of rap”
In HUMBLE, it was considered dissing Big Sean in that Kendrick was mocking Big Sean's well known adlib “Lil Bitch” and reversing it on him, telling him to sit down and be humble and in the process, turning it into a viral sensation (and what a viral sensation it was)
He then doubles down on his hecklers needing to be humbled in the 2nd verse:
”Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life”
Ouch
The right stroke, in “The Heart Part 4” was in response to Big Sean's diss again in no more interviews. In the first part of the song he doubles down on his title as the “Savior of Rap”
[Verse 1]
“Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior”
The 2nd verse, where he jabs at Big Sean, is as follows:
[Verse 2]
“My fans can't wait for me to son ya punk-ass
And crush ya whole lil' shit
I'll Big Pun ya punk-ass, you a scared lil' bitch
Tiptoein' around my name, nigga, you lame

afc514bc,How do you tell the difference between a stroke and a hemiplegic migraine?,"Hemiplegic migraine auras usually evolve in a stereotypical manner. For instance, symptoms may involve the face first, beginning with tingling and weakness around the mouth spreading to involve one whole side of the face over 10–20 minutes after which symptoms may slowly move up or down the ipsilateral arm, and then eventually the ipsilateral leg will be involved. The details of where they start and how they evolve differ, patient to patient.
Strokes are abrupt and all affected areas are affected simultaneously. The key point, however, is that stroke symptoms involve a specific arterial territory. Generally, the signs and symptoms of a stroke allow precise specification of the affected artery based on the clinical findings; scans just confirm the clinical impression.
In contrast to strokes, migraine auras do not respect arterial territories. The aura progression only makes anatomical sense as a process spreading across cortical tissue (Cortical spreading depression - Wikipedia
). As it spreads, it crosses from cortex nourished by one artery into areas nourished by another artery. In contrast, strokes do not slowly progress nor sequentially involve separate arterial territories.
TL;DR: The presentations of stroke and hemiplegic migraine aura differ in details that make sense in terms of their underlying mechanisms and brain neuroanatomy. Since the details of auras vary between patients, each patient is best served by learning their particular aura manifestations. Nothing prevents them from learning the cortical and vascular anatomy underlying their symptoms; it might be reassuring to them if they did. It's a big piece of medical education to learn, however. I never met a patient with that level of interest, but I'm sure some exist."
35fde76c,Does having a heart attack or a stroke hurt?,"Most strokes are painless; because the brain has no pain sensors. A heart attack hurts right in the center of your chest. It usually happens the first time on a cold winter day. You are outside working or exercising hard. Breathing the cold air chills the blood in the lungs and when it returns to the heart, it chills the coronary arteries., causing them to contract. If the coronary arteries are already plugged up with calcium and cholesterol deposits, the shrinking coronary arteries will not carry enough blood and oxygen to supply your heart, if you are working hard. The pain is strong enough to make you stop what you are doing. Quit work, go inside and warm up. The pain will go away, until you go outside and try to work again the next day in the cold. You need to stay inside and stay warm. When spring comes and the weather warms up, you can go outside and work again. In the meantime, you need to increase your intake of vitamin C. You need a tablet of 1,000 mgs of C each day. If you take too much C, it will give you diarrhea; but as soon as that clears up, keep taking 1,000 mgs per day. That amount should not give you diarrhea. It will take about a year for the vitamin C to clear up the calcium and cholesterol clogging your coronary arteries. If you are in a hurry to get better, take a tablet each of the amino acids lysine and proline each day with the vitamin C.The lower animals do not have coronary problems, because they make their own vitamin C in their livers; but the gene for making vitamin C is badly mutated in humans. An animal the size of a human, like a sheep, makes about 1,000 mgs of C each day; more when sick or injured. Vitamin C is used as a co-enzyme to cross link the collagen molecules, making them as strong as steel, for their weight. The protein collagen is what holds your body together. One half of the protein in your body is collagen. Collagen holds your arteries together. When you don’t get enough vitamin C, the collagen is weak and eventually starts to break. Calcium and cholesterol are used to reinforce the weak arteries; but eventually they build up and plug the arteries. You cannot get enough vitamin C from your diet, not even if you drink orange juice all day. I buy vitamin C in a bottle of timed-release 1,000 mgs size, 100 tablets at walmart for about $5.00; that is about 5 cents each per day. Read more about vitamin C on the Internet. Google “Why animals don’t get heart attacks; but people do” by Dr. Rath. Dr. Rath is on a mission to eliminate heart disease. On the other hand, you can go to your cardiac doctor and for only about $100,000 or more, he will cut your chest open and replace your plugged up arteries, and maybe a heart valve or two. Most patients survive the operation, but look like refugees from a WWII concentration camp. They recover in about 3 or 4 months. But because they still don’t take their vitamin C tablets, they usually die anyway in another 10 or 15 years, after their heart operation. by Jerry Collins"
3163d58d,Why is 2-stroke not available in the market?,"In the last century development of vehicles accompanied the 2-stroke engines
(1st stroke for injection and compression then 2nd for power and ejection) were in use.
Even some bikes in India such as YAMAHA crux or Kawasaki boxer had 2 stroke engines.
REASONS to upgrade engines from 2-stroke engines are:
1. less mechanical efficiency
2. noise pollution
3. very less fuel efficiency
4. not at all Eco- friendly
4-stroke engines which are the most commonly used in whole world because it overcomes the above mentioned demerits because each stoke in the 4-stroke engines
carries out only one single operation and that also efficiently:
injection
compression
power stroke
ejection
6-stroke engines have also come up by introducing hot water into the piston for removing the soot particles left after 4 strokes."
963c4ff9,Can a stroke lead to spiritual enlightenment like it did for Jill Bolte Taylor (in the video below)?,
ec9257e6,What is the stroking order of a 4-stroke engine?,"Remember:
Suck, Squeeze, Bang, Blow.
Suck. Intake stroke. Intake valve is open, piston starts at top dead center (TDC) and moves down in its bore to bottom dead center (BDC). This creates a vacuum which draws the intake charge into the cylinder through the intake valve.
Squeeze. The compression stroke begins. As the intake valve closes, the piston rises up in the cylinder and compresses the intake charge, and just before the piston makes it to TDC,
Bang. The ignition event occurs. In a spark ignition engine (gasoline etc), this is where the spark plug fires the air/fuel intake charge. In a compression ignition (diesel) engine, this is where the fuel is injected into the super hot air intake charge, which initiates combustion. The rapidly expanding gases created in the deflagrating ignition drives the piston down the bore, and imparts torque to the crankshaft. This is the power stroke.
Blow. Once the piston is back at BDC, the exhaust valve opens, the piston moves up the bore and pushes the spent gases out through the open exhaust valve. At TDC, the exhaust valve closes, the intake valve opens and we begin a new cycle.
This is the operating principle of all 4 stroke engines, no matter what fuel they burn."
504a1a72,How do I take 5 strokes off my golf game?,"I have two answers for you. The first one is the smart-alleck one: Play one less hole each round.
The better answer starts with finding out what part of your golf game is costing you the most strokes.
Putting. Three-putts can add strokes to your score quickly. Good players only have 20 to 25 putts per round.
Penalty strokes. These are scorecard killers. Every time you lose a ball in the woods or in the water, you have to takes a penalty stroke.
Sand traps. For the average golfer these are the equivalent of a one-stroke penalty because it takes one extra stroke on that hole to get the ball out of the sand.
Those are three different areas that add up quickly and can turn a good round into a bad one. You can reduce your number of putts in two ways: become a better putter or start off closer to the hole. This means you have to land your approach shots closer to the hole. You should have no shame in being on a par four in three shots if that third shot leaves you with a putt inside of five feet. You can save a lot of trouble (and time) if you learn to hit the ball better and keep it in the fairway or rough. Sometimes you have to swallow your pride and take less club so that you can keep the ball going straight. Also, there aren’t a whole lot of sand traps in the middle of the fairway or directly in front of the green. If you hit the ball straight the ball tends to stay out of sand traps.
All of this adds up to playing smart golf. It may not be as much fun but you will lower your score. Ten years ago I used to average 315 yards off the tee with my driver and I had a 14 handicap. After keeping track of of my stats I found those three areas were the ones driving my scores up. I spent many hours practicing my putting and chipping to get my scores down. Now I tee off with my 3-wood for 230 yds and my handicap is down to a 4 and I rarely three putt.
Figure out your weaknesses and make them your strengths."
c7c0379d,"Do you believe a person can recover from a major stroke? My husband suffered a massive stroke, a central main artery with occlusion stroke. I need some good hope as we face whatever is next.","OK. Let’s try for some good hope.
First, it’s impossible to say. The brain is quite plastic. It can’t repair itself, but it’s quite good at rewiring itself, working around injured areas and learning new functions when the previous brain areas aren’t able to perform them any more. The younger the person is, the more adaptable the brain is, but it’s still adaptable in people who are older. So there’s a reasonable/good possibility that your husband’s brain may be able to re-learn or adapt to his current condition.
Second, intensive rehabilitation can help, It’s best to begin as soon as possible and the most rapid progress is usually made in the first few months. On the other hand, progress can continue for years after the stroke or other brain injury.
Third, huge advances are being made in bionics, electronics, and other sorts of devices to help brain injury patients both recover and function.
None of that is a guarantee of anything. But some people make remarkable recoveries, or at least great progress. And the more work the patient and the family put into it, the greater the likelihood of progress. One piece of advice: Don’t take a physician’s pronouncement of “He’ll never be able to….again” very seriously. While the physician may be correct, you don’t know unless/until you try.
I interviewed the Pulitizer-prize winning columnist Art Buchwald several years after his massive stroke, and his progress was remarkable. And his isn’t an isolated story."
b568156a,Which lightening stroke is more dangerous?,"Typical cloud-ground CG lightning only lasts for tens of millionths of a second. It gives an intensely loud “bang,” but doesn’t carry enough energy to char or ignite materials, to cause steam explosions inside trees, etc. Certainly it might kill you via nerve damage or by triggering a heart attack. But many people have survived such lightning strikes. (It helps if you’re wearing a wet raincoat! The plasma-streamer then may never actually touch your body.) Dangerous yes. But not that dangerous.
However, the total length of lightning can be much, much longer, and the stroke may last far longer: from a good fraction of a second, up to several seconds at the maximum. These are the long-persisting or “hot lightning” strikes. They’ll set fires. They’ll explode trees and pole-transformers, melt metal, leave charred trails across the ground. At the upper end they’ll spread for miles across the sky. They can move around and change position during the strike, and will inject enormous energy into any object in their path.
Hot lightning can char wood, explode trees, melt cables, blow holes in the dirt. Imagine what it would do to a human body.
PS
I finally saw hot lightning! This was during Seattle’s bizarre 2019 lightning storm, thirty miles across and a couple hundred miles long. I saw hundreds of normal lightnings, the kinds which act like flashbulbs. I also saw two ground strikes where the streamer persisted for an entire half a second, took on a tortuous path like river oxbow-bends, and then broke up into a row of small flames of “bead lightning.” Whatever was hit could be charred and flaming, if not blown to pieces.
PPS
A colleague at an rf test facility tells a story from his grade-school in Louisiana, where a “hot” stroke melted the school’s aluminum flagpole! Was this exaggeration? Years later I asked a weather researcher about it, and he said that this sort of thing actually is quite common. Holy cow! If you have a small sailboat out during a storm down south, would you rather your aluminum mast be melted into a pool of slag, or instead have a wooden or fiberglass mast which explodes like a bomb?"
8e42ee2a,Is a 4 stroke more powerful than a 2-stroke? Which is a faster 2-stroke or 4 stroke engine?,"If your talking out board engines hp for hp two strokes dominate.
I have observed this time after time, but the definitive proof for me was on a NZ navy dive course circa 2004.
We had access to two identical 5.5 metre alloy boats with more or less new Mercury 90s on the back. One boat had the 2 stroke and the other had the 4 stroke. Same year same size, not to sure on weight of each.
When on the last week (or so) of this course, we spent our time off base, doing single tank dives. We would head out with a boatman in each boat and six divers across both boats.
Quickly we realised the boat with the 4 stroke on the back could only handle 3 people plus a single set of dive gear, and almost keep up with 5 guys and 5 sets of dive gear on the boat with the 2 stroke.
With 2 guys and no gear the 4 stroke caught up relatively quickly and had a better top speed, but it was pathetic when it came to getting up on the plain with a bit of weight on board, when compared to the 2 stroke equivalent.
So the 2 stroke has way more usable horse power, and anyone with half an inche of common sense knows that speed is all down to gearing.
Things may have changed in moder times, but I also can say my modern yamaha f115 has pretty crap useable low end power compared to the old 115hp v4 2 strokes. Way better on gas though."
6717e89b,Which engines have been invented earlier a 2 stroke or a 4 stroke?,"Both were made at almost the same time, but 2 stroke were implemented earlier than 4 stroke due to their simplicity to manufacture.
As we know that the Newcomen Atmospheric Engine of 1714 is a two stroke and so is the Watt Engine of 1775. But Watt-Boulton engine or 1817 is the first successful 4-stroke engine. Adding two more cycles to the process was Boulton’s idea to reduce heat per cycle and to improve efficiency, well it did the former quite well but the later wasn't achieved sadly. Adding two more cycles meant that the fuel was to be controlled and hence came the camshaft in 1795. 4 cycles also meant that speed in terms of RPM was greatly increased and so, governors were designed in 1813. Finally allowing the 4-Stroke engines out of a clumsy drawing board in 1817. But, not yet completely. They had a nasty habit of BLASTING. Which wasn't much resolved until 1900’s when for the first time pulsating valves were used in 4-stroke engines. By 1914 we only had a small sound left which is called knocking due to intermitters."
610140ce,Can there be a 2-stroke Diesel engine?,"2-stroke diesels are reasonably common outside of road vehicles. They work by using a low-pressure supercharger to force air into the cylinders and push exhaust gas out. Intake ports are exposed by the piston as it moves towards BDC, allowing air to be pushed in by the supercharger. An exhaust valve at the top opens at the same time, allowing the fresh intake charge to expel burnt gases.
As the piston rises, the air in the cylinder is compressed. Diesel fuel is injected somewhere around TDC, which ignites in the hot air and forces the piston back down. The exhaust valve opens, the intake ports are uncovered and the cycle repeats.
Unlike a 2-stroke petrol, where fuel and air are drawn in together, diesel fuel is added only to the closed cylinder. There is therefore no emissions problem of unburnt fuel escaping the engine in the exhaust. A 2-stroke petrol also uses the crankcase for scavenging, requiring oil to be added to the fuel-air mix and burnt. A diesel 2-stroke doesn't suffer this drawback due to the external supercharger."
f09f1540,Have you ever had a stroke?,I had a stroke when I was in my 30’s and was a waitress at that time for extra cash. I was counting my money on my bed at about 10am and the next day at 3am woke up on the floor next to my bed. My entire right arm had no feeling and I never went to the hospital or dr. I did rehab my arm with a broom stick lifting it up and down with the help of my left hand. It took months but I did recover. Because of that I can drive a stick shift car with my left hand better than anyone. If you think you have had a stroke see a dr or go to the er asap. If I would have done that I would have recovered faster. I was on the pill at the time and smoked and had high blood pressure. Get medical help. Laurie in Miami
26c5d87c,"If you don't get cancer, a heart attack, a stroke, diabetes, or Alzheimer's, how would one die of old age?","Simply speaking, every living thing has a defined life and due to prolonged usage, deterioration of various organs leads to death.
As you are aware, there are billions of cells in our body, which make up the basic structure. There is an in-built mechanism by which cells die after a specific period and new cells are generated to take its place. This process of generation of new cells is higher than the death of old cells till we are in growth phase. After that, the rate almost equals till late thirties. Beyond that, the rate of new cell generation declines and fewer cells are able to replace dead cells.
This cycle leads to deterioration of various body parts, most visible signs are seen in terms of our ability to see, listen, digest, etc. as well as wrinkles all over the body and problems in free movement.
Further, with the death of old cells, there is accumulation of free radicals and reactive oxygen in the body. This plays a vital part in aging and ultimately death.
Aging is generated by multiple causes including damage to the structures and functions of the molecules, cells, organs, etc., of an organism. Such causes of aging include but are not limited to oxidative stress, glycation, telomere shortening, side reactions, mutations, aggregation of proteins, etc. In other words, it is the progressive damage to these structures and functions that we perceive and characterize as aging. This damage leads to development of pathological conditions and, as a consequence, to death."
4ab327a7,What are four-stroke engines used in?,"In items being produced now in the following categories four strokes prevail. General Aviation and small Commercial Aviation aircraft up to about 400 horsepower single engined aircraft or 800 horsepower twin engined aircraft. In experimental and ultra light aircraft 2 strokes are often found, but 4 strokes are also common. Most motorcycles larger than 50 cc in developed countries. Almost all automobiles, busses, trucks, equipment for construction, farming, firefighting, logging, portable electrical generation, In marine applications 4 strokes dominate the emission regulated outboard market, the inboard outboard installations and the sub 10,000 hp market
2 strokes prevail in the hand held power tools, where power to weight is very important, where engine cost must be kept low, where brake specific fuel consumption is less important or conversely, where it is very important in huge engines powering ships and permanent electric power generation.
Turbine engines supplant piston engines where power to weight is important, maintenance needs to be limited, reliability is very important, purchase price is less dominant, BSFC is less critical and duty cycle is high. Generally this is in the 300 and up horsepower market."
d7e1b229,How did the term vinegar strokes come into usage?,It seems that the term ‘vinegar stroke (Note singular) goes way way back than thought. As vinegar was a form of contraception control. The mild acidic effect was believed to kill off sperm before conception could take place. Also as a way of hiding the odours. My Father used this term when I was a Lad 60+ years ago. I stand corrected if proven wrong.
dba26577,Can I mix 4 stroke oil with petrol for a 2 stroke engine?,First of all we should understand the concept of lubrication done on 4 stroke cycle and two stroke cycle engine… let understand 2 stroke first.. In 2 stroke cycle engine lubricating oil is mixed with fuel to lubricate the engine part.. And the oil burn with fuel (some part).. But in case of 4 engines are lubricated by oil held in an oil sump. The oil is distributed through the engine by splash lubrication or a presurized pump system.. So if u r using 4 stroke engine oil and mixing with fuel in 2 stroke cycle.. Technically it would work.. But it strongly depend upon the grade factor of oil…
612dcfef,Why do diesel engines have a higher compression ratio?,"Recollecting the stuffs that my teacher taught me….!!
Managed to recollect some technical stuffs…
Ok ,First i will give you a simple theoritical definition about what actually compression ratio means “compression ratio is defined as the ratio of total volume of the engine cylinder (ie..both clearance and stroke volume ) to the clearance volume” You can see the below image to know about it clearly…
Now i will tell you little practically “The compression ratio of an engine cylinder merely depends upon the size of the engine (If the engine is very bigger it will have more stroke volume obviously the compression ratio also increases(clearance volume is very small compared to stroke volume)…..You can see through the below image to get a simple idea about it…
Now coming to your question …I will list out some reasons why diesel engines have more compression ratios..
REASON 1: BASED ON THEIR APPLICATIONS
Diesel engines are mostly used for high torque applications (for eg…Trucks,Locomotives,Ships etc…)..Hence they need huge amount of power hence which means more combustion rate….I will tell you a simple fact.
IF ENGINE CYLINDER IS BIG ,MORE AIR GETS COMPRESSED DURING COMPRESSION STROKE AND HENCE MORE AMOUNT OF FUEL NEED TO BE SUPPLIED FOR IT ,HENCE MORE POWER IS PRODUCED INSIDE THE ENGINE WHICH EVENTUALLY LEADS TO MORE BRAKE HORSE POWER ..
Hence for this purpose diesel engines are usually made with larger cylinder sizes which leads to ‘more compression ratio’..
REASON 2: TO AVOID KNOCKING
Knocking is phenomenon in which means a abnormal combustion occuring inside the engine cylinder ….
It is more common in gasoline engines ‘INCREASING THE COMPRESSION RATIO MAY LEAD TO KNOCK IN GASOLINE ENGINES ‘..You can look at the picture below to know how combustion occurs in petrol and diesel engines(left is gasoline ,right is diesel)..
But leave about it ….In diesel engines knocking is actually reduced by having high compression ratios because ‘The combustion that is occuring inside a diesel engine is very abnormal and non-uniform in an diesel engine (this is why diesel engines have more vibrations) hence the cylinder size of the diesel engine is very high and also clearance volume is very less in order to avoid knocking…
Knocking also occurs when the fuel injected into the cylinder fails to ignite or combust incompletely which leads to knock.
Also when the temperature developed inside the engine cylinder may lead to know ..
Improper atomization of the fuel or time delay (which is literally called as Ignition delay )occurs in the Injectors…
COMING TO THE NEXT QUESTION YOU ASKED ….In fabrication side some modifications are done to withstand such more amount of power generated from the engine….
The pistons of the engines are usually made with HIGH CARBON AND HARDENED STEELS ,to bear much high impact during combustion even though sometimes the pistons are damaged…
Engine cooling and lubrications are another big challenge in diesel engines generally for this purpose synthetic oils are used for better lubrication and dust removal purposes…
The next thing to do is obviously increasing the size of the engine and fabricating bigger crankshafts (For gaining more torque) and also designing bigger connecting rods of better toughness and wear resistance for bearing such impact power..
I HOPE THIS ANSWER WOULD HAVE CLEARED YOUR DOUBTS …THANKS FOR VIEWING ,ANY CORRECTIONS IN THE ANSWER AND BETTER SUGGESTIONS ARE WELCOMED….."
8d926189,Why is buttermilk good in summer? Is it to prevent heat stroke?,"With the summer, the temperatures are rapidly increasing. As a result, we sweat more, causing us to need to increase our fluid intake drastically. To begin, buttermilk contains active cultures. This means that it has healthy bacteria that become active in the intestines. These pro biotic properties of buttermilk cause it to soothe the intestinal tract. These bacteria perform functions such as manufacturing vitamins, boosting immunity and manufacturing nutrients.
Buttermilk can also be used as a substitute for milk for people who have high lactose intolerance, since the process of making buttermilk converts the lactose to a more digestible substance — lactic acid. As a result of the higher lactic acid content, it helps in boosting digestion as well. Thus, more minerals such as proteins and calcium (from the milk) can be taken up by the body more easily."
3a557b63,What is Amit Shah's plan about PoK? Is he planning another master stroke which might shatter Pakistan?,"People of Gilgit-Baltistan have already expressed their desire to come & join with Ladakh with whom they share lot of history & culture. If you closely look, one will find that Gilgit-Baltistan & Ladakh share a long common border.
Pakistan had long withdrawn Maharajas 1927 policy of Art 35A kind law & settled Sunni Muslims all across Gilgit -Baltistan, which lead to civil war.
Recently as late as in 2018 Pakistan annexed Gilgit-Baltistan & placed it directly under Prime Minister of Pakistan without recognising it as a territory within the purview of the Pakistan state under it's constitution.
So far India refrained from going to International Court of Justice (ICJ) honouring Shimla Agreement of 'peaceful bilateral resolution of Indo-Pak issues' but if this time around Pakistan heads for ICJ themselves then as far as the legalities & circumstantial evidences available on record, Pakistan is likely to loose any claim on J&K for ever !!!!!
Now India may either take military or diplomatic action at the World forum & wrest Gilgit-Baltistan from Pakistan, which are legally Indian Territory.
If that happens them CPEC OBOR project will go for toss.

77307e2f,Why are diesel engines are often designed with a long stroke (as compared to gasoline engines)? What is it about diesel fuel itself that leads designers (generally) to use a longer stroke for diesel and a shorter stroke for gasoline?,"This is a myth because if you do a survey on diesel engines you will find the ratio between under square and over square diesel engines is around 50/50. If look back through the ages compared to modern engines you will find older engines in both petrol and diesel are predominantly under square ie longer stroke to bore diameter. This also relates to number of valves per cylinder as most engines these days are 4 valve per cylinder and need the room for the extra valves.
Another myth is torque. Many believe that a long stroke engine has more torque. A small diameter piston has less lbs force total pressure on the piston surface area but a long stroke with more mechanical advantage. A short stroke engine has a large piston diameter so high force due to large piston surface area and short stroke so less mechanical advantage. What is true though is speed range of the engine where peak torque is achieved. A long stroke or under square engine by having a small bore and thus smaller or less valves has breathing difficulty at high rpm so the engines valve timing and manifold design is optimised for lower speed. The reverse is true for short stroke over square engines."
f495bb75,"If a person commits a horrible crime and then suffers a stroke that causes them to totally forget having done it, should they be punished anyway?","If a stroke is severe enough to cause retrograde amnesia severe enough to erase all memory of a purported crime, the criminal should be punished, assuming that he or she was convicted and sentenced prior to the stroke. Culpability remains. If the stroke is so severe that the patient has a ""locked-in syndrome"" in which communication is virtually or literally impossible, the court may choose to conditionally release the individual to a care facility or home care, on compassionate grounds, as a prison setting is wholly inadequate for managing the stroke sequelae.
If, on the other hand, the stroke occurred after the alleged crime, but before the trial, the defendant should, most likely, not be prosecuted unless or until he or she is cognitively and physically capable of assisting in his or her own defense. With such a severe stroke, recovery would be unlikely. This situation would be very rare, but certainly conceivable.
A stroke that causes complete global amnesia for a long period of time (more than a few hours before or after the stroke), but spares even limited speech or cognition is exceedingly rare. Vanishingly so. There are case reports scattered through the literature, but most doctors will never see such a devastating stroke during their careers. The stroke would need to totally destroy the medial temporal lobe and the Hippocampus. This would be strikingly obvious, even to a layperson, on brain scan. My wife, a very experienced board-certified neurologist MD, has not seen such a stroke in several decades of practice."

db83e162,Why do strokes often happen in the bathroom?,"I spent a number of years driving an Ambulance back when I was very young - 20’s. Three of those years were spent on the “night car” - we came on duty in the evening and handled all the calls at night. We went off duty around 7:30. It was very common to get a “body removal” just before being called in. Invariably, we would find a body in the bathroom dead from natural causes. It was so common it became expected. We were tired and wanted to go home and such a call could keep us on duty for hours longer than planned. We held our breath as the time came nearer.
What happens is Papa wakes up feeling terrible - chest pains, nausea, whatever, he staggers into the bathroom to deal with it - sit on the toilet maybe, or lean over the sink and splash water on his face, get some medicine, who knows? And dies. Why? Any of the reasons old people succumb to old age - stroke, heart attack, etc. Anyway, Mama sleeps on. She wakes up in the morning to go to the potty and finds Papa dead. She calls us or the Police. Somebody then calls us to remove the body, or show up in emergency condition to try and save the guy.
We hated those calls. Picking up a 200+ pound, five foot or six foot sprawling mass wrapped up around a toilet or stretched out by the tub. in a tiny room is back breaking hard work. And in the morning when you’re tired and ready to go home after a long shift, doubly hard."
b92be225,Is having a stroke more dangerous than a heart attack?,"Both are dangerous, both are life-threatening. In the Western world, mortality rate for stroke is around 17% and for heart attack is around 14%. Rates maybe higher in developing countries.
Both can lead to disability— stroke can lead to neurological damage, weakness and paralysis. Heart attack can be complicated by cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, stroke and other sequelae. Also, they can vary hugely in degree - a mild stroke cannot be compared to a severe myocardial infarction, and vice versa.
Anyways, it's not as if we can choose one over the other. Ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction have the same underlying pathophysiology. Lifestyle changes to address inflammation, blood pressure, weight and other risk factors, can lower the risk of both myocardial infarction and stroke."
f7201548,"If you found out your uncle had had a stroke three weeks ago and remained in the hospital due to paralysis, what would you do to help?","So sorry to hear of your uncle's and his family's plight.
Living in Western Europe, having universal health care, I can't comment on the problems your aunt would face paying for the hospital bills since this would all have been covered by our mandatory (compulsory) health insurance. But I imagine your aunt wouldn't be the only one who isn't able to pay for a patient's medical care after such a calamity.
I sympathize with your fears about the family not being able to service their mortgage, losing income, and such consequences of your uncle being chronically sick in the long term and not being able to work.
In the place where I live and worked the family would long have contacted the hospital social worker, to figure out what support they could claim.
It might be that that is almost non existent in the US, but that the family will only know after contacting the hospital social worker. These people would have extensive experience dealing with uninsured people unable to pay for their hospital expenses too.
It's not clear to me why someone who had had a stroke after three weeks is still in a hospital, since for the majority of patients there wouldn't be much one could do in hospital better than elsewhere (rehab center, nursing home, home), the care being preventative drugs to prevent further vascular damage (e.g. heart attack, peripheral arterial disease) usual a statin regardless of his serum cholesterol level, see Page on thelancet.com
strict blood pressure control, not smoking, and rehab including exercises to learn to swallow better in our place done by a speech therapist.
Why is he still an in patient in the (expensive) hospital?
You personally can't do much other than support the family, like suggested by Chelsea Smith, helping them with whatever you can: clean the house, walk the dog, get groceries, maybe even cook for them, if you want to ask if they'll agree to you visiting your uncle. Don't think you would be able to help them out financially, although you could offer to help them pay for some of their smaller expenses if that's within your means.

4ec1c927,Can I use car engine oil on my 4-stroke motorcycle?,"Of course you can. Since the dawn of motorcycling until very recently there was only different grades of motor oil, not vehicle specific oils. And since at least the late 1950’s bikes with multiplate clutches that ALSO acted as centrigugal clutches have had regular motor oil specified.
There ARE certain oils produced specifically for certain cars these days which have friction modifiers but these are marked as such, and are usually very low viscosity (like 0w-20) and designed to cut internal resistance to improve the vehicle’s economy to make the figures look better.
People will tell you that synthetic oils won’t work in your bike because somehow, they are so slippery the wet clutches won’t grip. THAT is also utter bollocks. I personally have been running Mobil 1 fully synthetic in ALL my motorcycles since 1985.
The bikes were/are
Honda CD200…Wet clutch and pretty worn out and slipping a bit BEFORE I put Mobil 1 in…which made no difference.
Yamaha SR500….Wet clutch…Mobil 1 fully synthetic 5w-50
Husqvarna 350 Enduro 35 bhp MX motor…Wet clutch, and engine rebuilt at time of purchase by Husky Sport
in the UK who would ONLY guarantee the engine if it was fitted with Mobil 1 fully synthetic 5w-50
1963 Honda C100 Wet centrifugal clutch… Mobil 1 fully synthetic 0w-40
Honda C90 Cub…wet centrifugal clutch…Mobil 1 fully synthetic 0w-40
Honda cd185 Wet clutch, Mobil 1 fully synthetic 0w-40
Honda CD200 Wet clutch, Mobil 1 fully synthetic 0w-40
Honda CB125T , 12.000 rpm twin, Wet clutch, Mobil 1 fully synthetic 0w-40
Kawasaki W650 bought new in 1999…. Wet clutch…Mobil fully synthetic 1 0w-40.
2010 Honda 125i Innova…TWO Wet clutches, one centrifugal multiplate, one normal multiplate…daily commuter Mobil 1 fully synthetic 0w-40… (stolen)
2010 Honda 125i Innova…TWO Wet clutches, one centrifugal multiplate, one normal multiplate…daily commuter Mobil 1 fully synthetic 0w-40…
BMW R75/6 dry clutch….
Honda sh300 scooter….Some weird variator thing, but the engine has Mobil 1 fully synthetic in
SR500…Wet clutch…Mobil 1 fully synthetic 0w-40
All the bikes have regular Mobil 1 fully synthetic motor oil…Exactly the same oil that is in my Mazda MX-5
…And I work in a National motor Service Centre as an Assistant Manager so I talk to oil manufacturers
The ONLY time a fully synthetic oil might cause problems is if the bikes clutch is so worn out the only thing providing friction is burned oil because the friction material has worn away. true fully synthetic has cleansers that will remove that burned oil.
Your bike’s manual will specify the oil. It will probably say a 10w-40 …a 1989 spec ‘G’ oil. that is the MINIMUM quality to get the expected service life. Note that it doesn’t say Motorcycle specific oil…that isn’t an omission. No one would accidentally forget such a potentially litigious thing if it were true."

198491c3,Can a massage cause a stroke?,"To give an honest well informed answer to this question is hard because lot of post massage incidents go unreported .
There are random sporadic incidents of adverse events caused by Massages ( given by non professionals ) . The possibility of Stroke can not be ruled out if neck is the site of massage in a person who has Carotid artery Stenosis or someone with hyper coagulable blood with a clot sitting somewhere in the neck .
Inadvertent pressure on the Neuro vascular bundle in the neck can have its own complications since they are very superficial and Can have direct impact like shearing and tearing of the blood vessels in case of excess or inappropriate pressure application . Not forget the Pressure of carotid sinus can have its on effects . So having said even though this all is a possibility in theory some side effects are well documents but with low incidence . On the other hand benefits of massage therapy are also well documented .
In a nutshell - side effects are rare but possible .
Careful selection of trained massage professional is a must .
Full medical history , any medication intake and any medical or surgical concerns must be shared and risks disclosed between both giver and receiver of the massage .
For academic purpose here is an article of interest. A must read .
Sixteen case reports and four case series of adverse events after massage therapy were found. Massage was frequently used for rheumatological conditions. In the majority of these cases causality is established con- vincingly, for instance, through the sequence or nature of events. Some of the adverse effects relate to serious complications.
Considering the popularity of massage therapy, the number of reported adverse events seems minute. How- ever, this could be due to under-reporting. In a related area (spinal manipulation) we have, for instance, shown that under-reporting of serious adverse events is close to 100%
Clearly, one should differentiate between various approaches. The above findings suggest that massage by non-professional and forceful techniques like shiatsu, urut and Rolfing are relatively often associated with adverse events. The reports reviewed above are often incomplete. For instance, the background of the therapist and the type of massage therapy are not always described. This further limits the conclusiveness of the evidence.
Several systematic reviews of controlled clinical trials testing the effectiveness of massage therapies have been published and have arrived at cautiously positive conclusions . However, too few clinical trials of massage therapy exist and many of its claims are not backed up by evidence. Thus adequate risk–benefit evaluations are not feasible.
In conclusion, massage therapies are not totally devoid of risks. The incidence of adverse events is unknown, but probably low.

It was 0555; Lukas was awake and wanted out. I got out of bed, put my robe on and headed for the front door; open, out, close- and, since it was Saturday, I decided a cup of coffee slowly enjoyed as morning broke was a good idea. I headed for the kitchen.
And wondered why my left foot kept sliding along- couldn’t lift the thing- it was dead asleep- all pins and needles. Huh. Made a cup of Kuerig coffee (fast) while tapping my foot trying to get it to wake up. Reached for the sugar bowl with my left hand and watched my arm swooping around- that’s weird. Got hold of the sugar bowl, spooned some into my coffee, still swooping, took a gulp of it, and realized this wasn’t weird, this was a stroke.
DH heard me call, called 911; I was in a CT scanner within 30 minutes of that, and fifteen minutes after that was given the option of TPA since no bleed was found on the CT. I spent a day in ER, a day in SCU, a day in Med/Surg and then 10 days in a darned good rehab hospital. Currently, I can walk, type, do it all, just slowly and with lots of thought.
I couldn’t have stopped what was happening- there was nothing to stop it right then. No aspirin could have gotten into my brain fast enough. If I already had an IV in place, if we knew at that moment there was no bleed, if we had TPA just laying around the house, maybe I could’ve gotten away with less deficit- but each of those ifs is more impossible than possible. So, what I feel like is a plant that gets sideswiped by a killing frost- a few leaves got crisped, but the plant is still healthy, and new leaves will grow.
Once a stroke starts, you can’t stop it, although prompt medical care can break up the clot (usually) or stop the bleed (sometimes). And then you deal with the damage done."
fec1246f,Can stroke victims benefit from marijuana use?,"Stroke is a vascular problem. There is a decrease in the amount of oxygen going to the brain. This means neurons start to die, and brain function wipes out.
Cannabis (and in particular CBD) has been shown to be a neuroprotectant in mice, but its efficacy on humans has not been proven as of such yet. Anecdotally, and according to some NFL players, cannabis could indeed be neuroprotective. Cannabis may not only help protect surrounding nerves from the stroke/ischemic event, but may help repair them, too.
Why? Well, when a stroke occurs, “Glutamate” is released. Now, glutamate is a necessary chemical for sending signals to other cells, but is toxic when produced in excess. When a stroke occurs, the glutamate cannot be removed, destroying brain cells. CBD may help block this excess amount of glutamate from forming in the forst instance.
The problem with cannabis for stroke victims, however, is THC. THC may dull brain performance, so in this sense cannabis can be a bit of a “double-edged sword” for stroke victims."
7171ff3e,Does a stroke cause permanent brain damage?,"I had a major stroke at age 52 which changed my life forever. My right side was paralyzed from head to foot, and I lost my speech. I had daily physical, occupational and speech therapy for a long time and off and on again for years after that first year and still to this date to keep me functioning. I still cannot walk well after 26 years because my ankle never recovered. My car still has to have a left-fooot accelerator so I can't rent a car which limits traveling. I won't go in to all the details.
Yes a stroke does cause permanent brain damage because the stroke continues for around 48 hours destroying more of your brain by either depriving it of oxygen or flooding it with blood.
Another result which I happened to suffer is RSD, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. now known as Complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS. That is horrible. Intractable pain more severe than anything anyone can believe. It is the result of trauma, in this case brain trauma.
This may be more than you were looking for but if you were wondering if your brain gets all better by a certain time and things go back to normal, NO. Maybe you're wondering if someone you know will ever be the same. I have lots of residual issues which people can't see but I have to deal with. People having a major stroke like mine can kiss their paychecks good bye. You can no longer do the work you did before. And likely never will. But I'd say I'm doing pretty good for having half a brain!"
a1a07b19,What is the best kind of food after a stroke?,"I don’t think the types of food make a real difference. There is no magical food.
Just follow simple steps
Eat a wide variety of foods (mostly plant based) which contain all the nutrients and calories you need (number of calories is hard to estimate - check weight regularly to see if the average is growing or falling).
Avoid foods which can increase your chances of another
High fat foods for many people help cause strokes
Diabetes can cause strokes - so if you have any problems it is probably a good idea to avoid sugar and too many refined carbohydrates (actually limiting the carb intake a little is often good - we tend to eat lots of carbs, just try not to replace them with things which are less healthy for you)
If your blood pressure is high, then lower your sodium intake
Avoid transfats (probably fair advice for everyone)
Drinking too much. A little can be ok, or depending on other health problems it can even be good. But a little so easily becomes a lot. Consumption of too much alcohol can cause a lot of problems associated with stroke.
Don’t smoke
exercise if you can (obviously that would depend on the severity).
Follow doctors advice on medications and lifestyle.
All strokes are different anyway. A bleed will be different to a clot, etc."
18a0920c,What were you doing just before you had a stroke?,"I was holidaying with my family in a caravan park in a coastal town. 3 young girls and my wife. I was 40 years old. As a prequel I had a dull headache for a few weeks. Nothing major but I don’t get headaches. Was at the docs for something else and mentioned it. He had a quick look and said it’s probably neck/muscle related and could go to a chiro/osteo which might help. And if it doesn’t, come back and he’ll run some tests. He then said “don’t worry, chance of manipulating your neck and a stroke is about 100 million to one!” So I did that but didn’t seem to make much difference. Then was straight on holidays so I thought if it persists I’ll see him when I get back.
After dinner was finished on about the 6th day, my wife was putting the girls to bed and I was sitting in the camp chair with a glass of wine. I went to get up out of the chair to get a cigarette on the camp table and I started walking sideways. I checked myself and thought that was weird. I eventually got my smokes and made my way back to the chair and sat down. “Strange” I thought. But felt ok and resumed with a cigarette and the glass of wine. Note: it was only my 2nd glass so I knew I wasn’t drunk.
I got up 15 minutes later and started cleaning up and everything was fine. About another 30 minutes later exactly the same thing happened. I got out of the chair and walked sideways. This time I concentrated on walking straight, but it just didn’t happen. Weird again I thought. Sat down and mildly concerned but not really that worried. My wife came out from the arduous task of putting 3 girls to bed ranging from about 4-10 and we had another wine.
I then felt a bit weird. Sort of tired and not quite right. It was now about 9:30pm. I said I’m going to bed.
I went to sleep pretty quick and over the next few hours woke up occasionally in a sort of stupor and tried to lift my head off the pillow but it wouldn’t move. It was like when you half wake up from a heavy sleep and you can’t lift your head so I thought it was dream state. Eventually I woke up and couldn’t lift my head and I thought “no, I’m really awake and I can’t lift my head” I tried a few times and then found I could sort of roll to one side. I really then concentrated and lifted myself up and crawled off the edge of the bed. I sort of sat down next to the bed and my wife woke up. She said are you ok, and I said I need a shower. I felt like my body was not right and was breathing heavier and just felt wrong. At this point I thought I may have been bitten by some bug and had been poisoned. She started getting concerned. About a minute later I said fairly calmly “I think you should call an ambulance”.
Well panic broke out. She called an ambulance and i made my way outside with her assistance and sat on a chair. She was asking what was wrong. I said I’m not sure and was slurring my words and my whole right side was not working, including my mouth. We waited for about 15 minutes and the ambulance quietly made its way through the park and found us. The ambo talked to me and about a minute he said “I think you’re having a stroke”. It was surreal. My wife woke the girls up and neighbouring ‘campers’ came out and it was a bit of a scene. It was a bit sketchy but I was put in the ambulance and taken to the local country hospital.
I spent about 4 hours in there with some scans and tests but they weren’t 100% sure what it was. They didn’t have an MRI machine and as I kept going in and out of ‘functions’ on my right side every 30 minutes one doctor thought it could be Bells Palsey. I could function almost normally and then a few minutes later my whole right side was paralysed and couldn’t talk properly. This happened at least 6 times at the hospital and on reflection happened at least that again from earlier in the evening.
Eventually they said I needed to be transferred to Melbourne and as I was stable went by ambulance. I stopped going in and out of paralysis by then and my right side was not as bad as the worst times but pretty much 80% gone. This is the first time I panicked. I though “what if this is it? Am I going to be like this forever”. It was very scarey. My only thoughts were for my wife and girls and they’d have to look after me forever. I was never afraid of dying and didn’t feel any real pain, just wrong.
The trip took 4 hours. As soon as I got to the specialist neuro hospital they did an MRI and found the spot where the clot had been. It was in my brain stem ( left pons). The clot had since cleared. The head of neuro came and saw me a few hours later and spoke to me. He said I had suffered multiple strokes every 30 minutes as the clot had moved slightly and let the blood flow. Then it lodged and blocked the flow. And so on. I’m not sure what happens but he said clots sometimes just eventually break up which mine did.
To cut the rest short I was probably lucky for the clot movements. It allowed some respite to get function going again for a while before the next stroke. I made a 90% recovery within 6–8 weeks. Slurred speech eventually came back and co-ordination which was all over the place also came back. I probably made ‘full’ recovery within 6 months, but it did change my tolerance to things and I came apathetic to many things.
They never found the cause (it wasn’t attributed to smoking). There was dozens of tests. My arteries and heart were fine and as the specialist said it’s fairly unusual in someone my age and most likely was an impact trauma (sport related or something) and a one off, but you never know.
A year later I left my wife for reasons I can’t fully explain ( she is the most amazing person I’ve ever met and would make for another long story). I still regret it and will to the day I die, but we are still friends and have moved on with our lives and are relatively happy. Our girls are ok and are now beautiful young women.
It’s been 12 years and physically I’m fine. I still occasionally miss judge a step or something but you wouldn’t notice it. When I was in hospital I saw many older people who were pretty much vegetables. I was very, very lucky for the outcome.
Postscript. When I went back to the doctor a few months after for ongoing medication etc, you should have seen the look on his face. He’s a good doctor and been our family doctor forever so I wasn’t going to look at any ‘avenues’. But I think he would have been quietly shitting himself."
5756f083,"I want to know everything about bikes. How do they work? What should be looked for before categorizing them into good and bad? What are cc, strokes, etc.?","In this answer I will be trying to make you understand the terms which you are going to face often on the web pages of different motorcycles.
4 Stroke Engine
A 4 stroke engine is the one in which the piston completes four separate strokes while turning a crankshaft. A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder, in either direction.
4 strokes can be categorized as following :
(Please refer to this animation as I couldn't incorporate it in my answer
Four-stroke engine
)
Intake: Open the intake valve(right one in the following diag.) so that air fuel mixture can come into the chamber.

Compression: Compress the air fuel mixture.

Power: While the mixture is fully compressed and piston is at its top most position, ignite the mixture using spark plug.Ignition leads to expansion of air-fuel mixture and thus forces the piston down to its bottom most position.

Expansion: Exhaust valve (left one in above diag.) is opened and the piston forces the residual air-fuel mixture out of the chamber.

These days all bike engines are of 4 strokes so their is no need to get further into it. Let's start focusing on more important aspects.
4 Valve and 2 Valve
In above diag. you can see there is one valve present for intake and one valve for exhaust of air fuel mixture hence the term 2 valve engine. In a 4 valve engine, there are 2 intake valves and 2 exhaust valves.
Just as when you run at fast speeds you start taking breath from mouth as well, having 2 extra valves will help engine to get air-fuel mixture in sufficient amounts at higher rpms. Sports bike like R15 and CBR have 4 valve engine whereas 2 valve engines are more common in street bikes.
SOHC and DOHC
In the engine diagram shown above, just above the rods attached to intake and exhaust valves, you can see two rotating pieces having a bulge outside. This mechanical piece is known as Cam and the bulge present at its surface helps to open and close the intake and exhaust valves just at right moments.
Both cams used to be attached to a single rotating shaft, known as Camshaft, as shown in the following diagram.
Fig. 1: The two bulgy pieces are Cams and the whole structure of cams and shaft/rod going through them is called Camshaft. Orange pieces are the rods connecting intake and exhaust valves.
(Refer Camshaft
for complete animation)
In a 2 valve engine a single camshaft is enough to open and close intake and exhaust valves by placing the cams at appropriate angles. Things get complicated in a 4 valve engine. There are two options to circumvent this problem :
i) Use two camshafts, each camshaft having 2 cams for 2 inatke valves and other camshaft having cams for 2 exhaust valves.
ii) Use single camshaft alongwith more complicated mechanism to operate all 4 valves.
Hence, the name dervied are :
SOHC : Single Overhead Camshaft
DOHC : Double Overhead Camshaft

Fig 2: 2 Valve SOHC Engine ( Image source Motorcycle Specifications
)

Fig 3: 2 Valve DOHC Engine ( Image source Motorcycle Specifications
)
As the camshafts are present just directly at the head of the engine, hence the name Overhead. Just to avoid any confusion, camshafts are present outside the engine but just above its head.
DOHC layout has better valve opening and closing timings and more precise also but increases the weight and number of moving parts in engine. SOHC although will be lighter but we will have to use rocker arms to control the valves.
CBR has 4 valve DOHC engine while R15 has 4 valve SOHC engine. 2 valve engine bikes have usual SOHC.
Spark Plug
Position of spark plug plays key role in the efficient combustion of air-fuel mixture, as the ignition should spread evenly in the chamber. A 4 valve DOHC engine offers very favourable top central position for spark plug. In case of 4 valve SOHC engine, due to single camshaft present at top central position, spark plug is placed slightly away from this key position.
Fig 4: 4 Valve DOHC Engine with spark plug in the middle of 4 vlaves (Image source http://www.caranddriver.com
)
Bajaj has been using DTSi technology which use two spark plugs instead of one for more efficient combustion although other key players are able to give equivalent benefits using only single spark plug.
Air Cooled and Liquid Cooled
Air cooled engines are cooled naturally by outside air. They generally have fins present to dissipate more heat.
Fig 5: Air cooled engine. (Image source http://zxj510228.en.ec21.com
)
Liquid cooled engine is surrounded by a continusouly flowing coolant which absorbs the heat and dissipate it at the radiator. Liquid cooling is used in the engines having high compression ratio, which can operate at high rpms as sports bike.
Fig 6: Liquid cooled engine (Image source http://www.iamabiker.com
)
R15 and CBR use liquid cooled engine as opposed to air cooled engine in FZS, Gixxer, etc.
Max Power and Max Torque
These parameters are of great importance to look out for while comparing motorcycles but they are very hard to understand and quite confusing. I am incorporating few words from this article http://www.bikesindia.org/reviews/difference-between-motorcycle-power-torque-explained-which-is-better.html

Power: The Power produced by any engine is the capacity of that engine to take the motorcycle to its maximum speed.
Torque: The Torque generated by an engine is an entity which determines the pulling capacity of the bike.
You will have to dive deep into this topic on your own.
Displacement
As given on Wikipedia, engine displacement is the volume swept by the piston inside the cylinder of engine in a single movement from top dead centre (topmost position) to bottom dead centre (bottommost position), commonly specified in cubic centimeters(cc). Generally higher the displacement higher the torque and power you get. But there is no direct relationship between displacement and power. For example Honda CB Trigger with 150cc engine given max power of 14 bhp whereas Honda CBR 150R with 150cc engine gives max power of 18 bhp.
So instead of looking just at displacement, give more weightage to maximum torque and maximum power the engine can deliver.
Disc Brake and Drum Brake
In a disc brake, the brake pads squeeze the disc attached instead of the wheel, and the force is transmitted hydraulically instead of through a cable. Friction between the pads and the disc slows the disc down.
Fig 7: Working of disc brake ( Image source http://auto.howstuffworks.com
)
In drum brake set of shoes or pads press outward against a rotating cylinder-shaped part called brake drum.
Disc brakes are superior to drum brakes in stopping vehicle, they dissipate heat better and also have less wear and tear. General trend is to have disc brakes in front, as momentum is transferred to the from while stopping, and drum brakes in rear due to cost constraints. High end bikes have disc brakes in both front and rear.
Fuel Injection and Carburetor
Constant supply of air-fuel mixture in right proportions and in right amount to engine is of upmost importance and the amount should be adaptable according to the factors like the speed at which engine is running, load, etc. Before the advent of modern electronic sensors, this task was handled by a mechanical device called Carburetor.
Fig 8: Carburetor (Image source http://www.rc-trucks.org
)
Now days, carburetors are replaced with electronic Fuel Injection systems which gather engine operation information using various sensors and then decide the control over the air-fuel mixture.
Carburetor are still popular in motorcycles and there is a heated debate between which one to use. Carburetors can be diagnosed by a mechanic in case you got unlucky in some remote area and their performance have been quite satisfactory until now. Fuel injection systems provide better fuel efficiency and power but to what extent is a topic of debate. Also if you got unlucky with fuel injection system in a remote area, then there is not much that you can do. There are lot of other factors which you can find on internet.
Twinshock and Monoshock Rear Suspension
For rear suspension generally Twinshock absorbers are used but they add additional weight and get bendy and flexible in extreme riding conditions.
Fig 9: Simplified view of twinshock absorber ( Image source The Car Maintenance Bibles
)
These problems can be overcomed by the use of Monoshock absorbers.
Fig 10: Monoshock absorber ( Image source BikeAdvice.in
)
Monoshock are more popular with high end sports bike and Twinshock with general street bikes.
Full Fairing and Half Fairing
A motorcycle fairing is a shell placed over the fame of some motorcycles with primary purpose to reduce air drag. Full fairings cover both upper and lower portions of motorcycles, as distinct from a half fairing, which only has an upper section, and leaves the lower half of the motorcycle exposed.
Fig 11: Full fairing, most portion of engine gets hidden behind the fairing. (Image source http://sv1000.lsn.net
)
Fig 12: Semi faired version of Karizma. (Image source Top Speed In
)
Kerb Weight
Kerb weight is the total weight of a vehicle with standard equipment, all necessary operating consumables such as motor oil, transmission oil, coolant, air conditioning refrigerant, and a full tank of fuel, while not loaded with either passengers or cargo. So lesser the kerb weight more performance engine can provide.
Wheelbase
Wheelbase is the distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels. Well the shorter it is the quicker a bike can turn and the longer it is the more stable it will be. That is why criusers like Bajaj Avenger have much greater wheelbase compared to other street and sports bikes.
Fig 13: (Image source http://www.carbibles.com
)
More motorcycle geometry and handling factors can be read at Motorcycle Geometry 101
.
Tubeless Tyres
Tubeless tyres do not require a separate inner tube and hence light weight and air leakage is slower in case of puncture. You can cover few more kilometers on motorcycle itself once tyre gets punctured.

At the end of my answer, I will say that although the features described above play key role, factors which cannot be described but rather can only be experienced are handling, comfort, easiness in shifting gears, engine vibrations, noise and many more.
I will also not recommend you to maximize the features described above as that will lead you only to Sports Bikes. Instead, first the select category from which you want your bike to be and then you can sort according to the above parameters. Bikes are broadly categorized as :
Street
Cruiser

46a645a1,Why is the risk of a stroke in young people on the rise?,"I assume you're talking about the recent report published in the Annals of Neurology.
First, it's important to note that the increased risk over the last couple of decades looms large in terms of percentage but is quite small in terms of actual numbers: from 3.1 cases per 10,000 people to 4.7 cases per 10,000 people.
Second, the authors note that some of the increase isn't actually because more people are having strokes, but that we're getting better at detecting and diagnosing strokes.
Most of the young people who had strokes, according to the study, had diabetes or high blood pressure. So the risk factors that lead to diabetes or high blood pressure are, unsurprisingly, also risk factors for stroke: obesity, poor diet, smoking, lack of exercise."
37fe9319,"After a stroke caused by a clot, how long does the blood clot remain in the brain?","There is an adage that when something involves the brain, it's like real estate - it's all location, location and location. Even with the evolution of intracranial bleeds, location (what space they occur in) is important. The Question suggests it is about intracerebral bleeds (blood within the brain itself, instead of around it), so I will answer accordingly.
All clot within the brain eventually reabsorbs, if the patient lives long enough. There is much variability in how long this takes, but in general, the larger the clot, the longer it takes.
A small ""bruise"" may disappear in a week or two on CT or MRI. A larger clot may take 3 - 6 weeks to clear. The really big ones may clear in terms of their density on CT, but will show permanent MRI changes and leave a cavity and distorted residual brain behind.
Please keep in mind that if you look hard enough (for example, using PET scanning, or post-mortem fine histology) you can find identifiable residua more often and for a longer time.
Also keep in mind that such structural evaluations have only a weak relation to how well the brain functions around the clot, and how quickly recovery of that function takes place.
Anyone who has been in this business long enough will remember a patient with normal CT and MRI who nevertheless exhibits a deep and prolonged coma. On the other hand, we occasionally see surprisingly good function in patients with impressive clots in so-called ""non-silent"" parts of the brain.
It's amazing I think to see how the body has a sense of what tissue belongs where and in what quantities - even in the brain, which is more isolated from healing and immunological cells than other organs.
Hope this helps!"
c69bc483,What is the basic difference betwen 6 stroke engine and 4 stroke engine?,"Six stroke engine have two additional strokes than four stroke engine. Those extra two strokes are again inlet and exhaust.
There is lot of heat energy stored in cylinder walls from previous Power stroke. This accumulated heat is used to expand either air or water(Which will convert into steam), Depending upon specs.
Working
Exhaust stroke completes, then air or water is injected into a cylinder. After that, enthalpy of air increases and it expands rapidly resulting one more power stroke. Air is released to atmosphere.
Six stroke engines have higher efficiency and does not require sophisticated cooling system. However, it is difficult to gain smooth power from six stroke engine because, 1st power stroke is very powerful and 2nd power stroke does not contain more power as well as it takes twice the time to take 3rd power stroke from second as compared 1st and 2nd..
In short six stroke engines are not refined as four stroke engines. It will require lot of improvement to use commercially."
259ab7c8,Transgender: Are there any dangers in allowing adults to change their legal genders at the stroke of a pen?,"In some countries (I can only speak for the US), you already can petition to have the government recognize you as having the gender of your choice.
The requirements to do so vary depending on where you are:
In places like California, your doctor has to fill out an affidavit stating that you have taken the ""clinically appropriate treatment""[1] to change your gender.
Places like DC are more flexible - they still require some professional's affidavit, but it only needs to state what your gender identity is[2], not what you've done about it.
Other states (and countries) will have slightly different requirements.

Your petition could be denied - though you can usually apply again.
There are, of course, conditions and restrictions to doing so - just like there are for changing your name. As Mykell Miller and Key Foster point out, the bureaucracy alone will probably deter most frivolous applications.
There may be additional restrictions and/or guidelines, depending on what other laws or institutions refer to a person's gender:
Marriage - Jurisdictions that don't recognize same-sex marriage would presumably want to stop same-sex couples from ""simply"" changing their gender in order to be legally married. (Happily, this isn't a legal in the US anymore.)
Prison - Some systems are not co-ed, so either prisoners would not be allowed to change genders while incarcerated or the system would have to handle the situation where they do.
Business fraud - Any state would probably look down on someone applying for a change in gender designation simply for access to lower insurance rates[3], for example.
These are just off the top of my head; there are likely many others.

So, to answer the question exactly as explained in the question details:
Would there be dangers in allowing people to change their legal gender designation without any restrictions or conditions? Definitely.
However, this is not a plausible scenario by any stretch - because a person's legally designated gender has a variety of legal implications, there would have to be a formal process with conditions and restrictions around it.
Would there be dangers in allowing people to request changes to their legally designated gender at will? Not really.
There would be many considerations (such as the above examples), but this is largely because there are many laws/institutions that were made under the assumption that everyone is Cisgender
by birth.
There aren't ""dangers"" - in the sense that there aren't any harms that would necessarily follow from the basic idea of permitting people to change their legally designated gender.

63639f87,"Which type of engine is used in marine, two stroke or four stroke?","What a coincidence..!!
I just gave my IC end semester exams and here I am answering the Same question.
Specifically, in Marine engine, 2 STROKE ULTRA LONG STROKE ENGINE running on Heavy Diesel Oil are used. They are used to produce High Torque and longs stroke is used to provide enough time to burn that heavy residual diesel oil. Also, in Merchant vessels, speed is rarely a requirement..So the rpm is around 80–100. These engines are 3 storey's tall, with a bore diameter of upto 1 m.
High Toque is required for propulsion. It also prevents losses which might occur in the propeller (cavitation, Eddy current losses.etc)
Although, Medium speed 4 Stroke engines are couples to generators for production of electricity onboard ships.

531cf396,Do cows like being stroked?,"If they're tamed, sure. Cows are domestic, but most aren't truly tamed, two different things. You can raise a baby cow like a pet and it will be like a pet and enjoy being stroked and pampered, but most cattle free range on pasture and don't consider themselves pets, a human approaches they move away. When a farmer rounds up his cattle he's in essence hunting them, in the eyes of the cattle and the dogs he is using to do it. The whole activity relies on predator/prey instincts and behaviours from all parties. You can have one or two tame pet cows, but you could never have hundreds or thousands. Big herds of cattle by definition need to be largely independent and see themselves as free wild animals, even if they technically are not. A human then is just another predator."
0ab3f1c3,"What's the best way to get in shape by swimming? What’s the most time efficient method, and what are the best strokes? How many laps?","I think swimming is awesome exercise. Swimming is also something that everyone thinks comes naturally but in reality 95% of everybody is extremely bad at it! Swimming got a reputation for being 'good' cardio because 95% of people just churn the water, waste energy and just exhaust themselves. It is possible to go get very good at swimming very quickly. In which case swimming becomes high quality, comfortable cardio where you elevate for heart rate for extended periods of time, you have low impact to your joints (and you don't feel like you are dying).
It is possible to get very good at swimming very quickly. The key is to follow the Total Immersion Swimming Program by Terry Laughlin. Let me repeat that because no one believes me. The key to getting good at swimming it to read (and watch the DVD) the book Total Immersion Swimming by Terry Laughlin.
Terry is the de facto expert on teaching people how to swim PROPERLY in the shortest amount of time.
I will not talk about the swimming drills that Terry recommends because they are in his book and you should read it. What I will mention is how swimming is a different kind of skill them most people think. In running, 90% of your energy is used to move you forward and 10% of your energy is loss to drag. In biking, 50% of your energy is used to move you forward and 50% is loss to drag. In swimming, 2% of your energy is used to move you forward and 98% is loss to drag! Olympic swimmers are 300% faster at swimming then the average person because they use 6% of their energy and ONLY waste 94% of their energy.
What does this mean?? It means that to be a good swimmer you should be WHOLLY concentrating on reducing drag. That is the path to quick swimming. If you master the drills that Terry says you will quit drowning and will start being able to swim lap after lap after lap with constant heart rate.
What is the single best indicator for a good swimmer:
Stroke count --how many strokes does it take to get across the pool? This number is an indicator of the quality of your form and your ability to reduce drag. A bad swimmer takes 22+ strokes to get across the pool. An average swimmer takes ~18 strokes to get across the pool. A good swimmer takes ~13 stokes to get across the pool. A Olympic swimmer takes 9 strokes to get a cross the pool! If you can use less strokes to get across the pool then you are using less energy per distance which means you are swimming more efficiently (i.e. less drag). Terry teaches you how to learn good form and reduce drag.

How I used Total Immersion Swimming.
In 2010 I did a Triathlon. Prior to this I had not swam for about 10 years. I practiced the drills in the book and on the DVD and I went from dying on 2 laps to over 40 laps with no problem. I also did all of this in 10 hours of TOTAL practice time. I then did a Sprint Triathlon with 1/2 mile open water ocean swim, 12.4 mi bike ride and 3.1 mi run. I placed in the top 50 percentile at the race. Not bad.
Here is another good introduction and testimonial of the power of Total Immersion swimming by author Tim Ferris. Total Immersion: How I Learned to Swim Effortlessly in 10 Days and You Can Too
For schedule I would do three weights lifting sessions a week and do two swimming sessions a week. Although if you actually learn how to swim properly then the stress of swimming will actually be extremely mild on your body and you could either swim after your weightlifting sessions a form of recovery or you could swim six days a week in the morning because you enjoy it. It won't really matter. Just find out what you like."
c65ec91d,Can a person be fully recovered after brain stroke?,"Yes, a person can be fully recovered after brain stroke but it will depend on condition to condition. If there is a very little portion of Brain is damaged due to stroke then the recovery is possible within few weeks but if it damaged a major portion of the brain then there are chances that full recovery may not possible.
If you want treatment for Brain Stroke then you can consult with Dr. Vikram Bohra who working as a Neurologist in Jaipur

It so very good for technology is growing in India day by day, but how the people are getting addicted on daily routine, it is not beneficial for every one for healthy life,. This is the reason, people are trying to get more luxurious life but at the same time situation getting worse and effecting to Thier health. I can tell you ample of example, which shows the bad effects- using mobile,. Seeting work for long hour, at desktop,. Fast food or junk food,. No exersize, running more havning bike and car as is mode of transport for daily work. I know the time, when my father, grandfather use to travel by bicycle for 10 km 20 km 50 km. This is not because of they were not having Money to buy, just because of good habit and maintaining there at very old age. I would like to as those type strength in today's generation.

Can US Presidents really cut Social Security with the stroke of their pen, as Biden said?","I have researched Social Security for nearly a decade. There is no truth to any of Biden’s statements about Social Security. He should know his statements are inaccurate. (There are fact problems with Trump’s words too - but that is a different question.)
Social Security is a serious program, and deserves better from both sides.
Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on President Trump’s Executive Orders to Sow More Chaos and…
“Donald Trump said today that if he is re-elected, he will defund Social Security.”
“Our seniors are under enough stress without Trump putting their hard-earned benefits in doubt.”
“One order is Donald Trump’s first shot in a new, reckless war on Social Security. Trump announced a payroll tax plan with no protections or guarantees — like the ones the Obama-Biden administration enforced a decade ago — that the Social Security Trust Fund will be made whole.”
All False 100%
Trump’s executive order has nearly no impact on Social Security because of the quirky way that Social Security collects revenue - see #1 if you want detail.
Trump has said that he will pursue legal means to forgive the deferred taxes. This is only something that Congress can do, and in every case in the past the program has been re-imbursed for lost revenue - including the CARES ACT - see point #2 for detail
Trump has said that he would like to repeal the payroll taxes, and replace them with money from the general fund. This is the opposite of a cut -see #3 if you want detail.
There are enough problems with Trump’s policies that there is no need to fear-monger the elderly purely for the benefit of votes.

#1 : This is the SSA’s documentation on how Social Security collects revenue : Taxflow and adjustments
. Trump’s order doesn’t last long enough to even delay revenue going to Social Security. When people talk about ‘a delay’ in revenue, it means that they do not know how the program works. hard truth.
#2 : Here is the CARES Act text : https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3548/text#id4e306ba7a4e7417ca51267b5ac407d8e
#3 : Today we talk about benefit cuts when the trust fund is exhausted. This discussion goes away because Trump would make the program’s liabilities a liability of the government as a whole. That might sound good to you, but it opens the door to massive benefit cuts in the future because future voters may not like the idea that they have to pay for the gap between what we paid and the amounts that the people we elected promised. This is a dangerous policy - one that comes with either party."
980ce4b3,Why are there hardly any sans-serif typefaces with a high contrast in stroke weight?,"This question addresses one of the fundamentals of type design, the function of the serif in the context of contrast.
Understanding this issue is much easier when explaining it from the vantage point of calligraphy but for all of us non-calligraphers, here is an explanation that tackles it from a purely empirical perspective:
Looking closely at the transition of thick to thin, tracing the stroke of the bowl in a glyph like the lower case d a characteristic dynamic in the development of thickness (or visual weight) can be observed. The difference in stroke weight and the transition between the thickest and the thinness moment is called the glyph’s contrast.
Take for instance a typeface like Didot or Bodoni where the hairline curls around with unchanged thickness and then suddenly picks up weight.
Now compare this unique transition of contrast to the gradual transition of weight in the b’s bowl of a typeface like Garamond or Bembo. Starting at the branching, the very first moment where the bowl branches from the stem, the thickness of the stroke increases throughout the arch of the bowl in a very typical manner.
Keeping this observation in mind check out the lower case character i in each of the two typefaces. Without the serifs attached to that short little stem, the i might be part of just any old sans-serif typeface as there is no transition of visual weight. Without serifs the i would not have any contrast. The serifs take over this specific role. They represent for all the stems the transition of contrast that is taking place in the bowls. That way, with the help of the serifs, every stem in a typeface expresses the same thick-thin contrast as the bowls. This binds the glyphs of a typeface together. Thanks to the serifs they all follow the same set of design rules. This creates uniformity and makes sure all glyphs express their shared family traits.
High contrast typefaces without serifs are simply breaking this rule. There is absolutely nothing wrong with breaking rules in design. But as always the expert can tell the difference between a designer who knows the rules and then breaks them and a designer who does so oblivious of the rules. This naiveté can be charming but hardly counts as good craftsmanship. The more the typographer understands type design the safer their choice of typeface becomes."
da060fb1,Can you die in your sleep from a stroke?,"It's quite rare for a person to die due to stroke while sleeping.
However it's possible.
A strategic infarct in the brainstem due to occlusion of the basilar artery can knock out the respiratory and cardiac centers leading to death.
Massive infarcts of the hemispheres could theoritically cause herniation and brainstem compression leading to death.
Torrential intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrage can also possibility lead to sudden death while asleep.
However it's more common for a person to wake up from sleep with symptoms of stroke."
9fd56ba0,Did you not recognize your symptoms of a heart attack or stroke?,"I blame TV for my ignorance of what a heart attack REALLY is. I had no clue what was happening or how lucky I was to be alive until days after.
We have all seen TV shows where the guy falls down and they get the defibrillator out and shock his heart to start again. This was a heart attack to me. And as I have recalled my experience to many others, they believed the same thing. That my friends is cardiac arrest and not a heart attack.
For those who may be ignorant on the subject as I was, your heart is a muscle and that muscle requires oxygen to survive. The oxygen is provided by blood that flows through the vessels along the heart muscle. When one of those vessels becomes restricted or blocked and the heart begins to starve for oxygen, you are having a heart attack.
My symptoms started Sunday night under stress. I had debilitating pain right between my shoulder blades. I went to work Monday for 2 hours before going home because of pain.
Monday evening I went to a clinic because of this back pain. They checked my bp and sent me home with muscle relaxers.
Tuesday morning I woke up and the pain had moved from my back to my left arm. A horrible pain I will never forget. I went outside with my coffee, smoked 2 cigarettes, called in sick to work, took a Vicodin and a muscle relaxer and went back to sleep.
Tuesday afternoon I was curled in the fetal position crying from the pain. I had thrown up twice. Took more Vicodin along with some extra strength aspirin and more muscle relaxers.
Tuesday evening I couldn’t take the pain anymore. I called a friend to come take me to the hospital.
The admitting nurse took one look at me and knew. Crowded ER and I was taken immediately in and hooked up to an EKG and then told I was having a heart attack. Ten minutes later I was naked in the cath lab with a gown just thrown over me and I have no idea how many people swarming around me.
Turns out, I had a 99% blockage of my Left Anterior Descending artery, a widow maker. There was permanent damage done to my heart. I was told a week later that a man a few years older than me came in 2 hours later for the exact same thing and didn’t make it.
No, I didn’t recognize my symptoms. Not because they weren’t there, but because of my ignorance."
d24f283f,Is it true that President Trump had a small stroke this month?,"Writing this from UK
I don’t know whether tRUMP did or did not have a “small” stroke - but such a stroke, if caught within a few hours - can be fixed quickly if it’s caused by a blood clot.
I had a small stroke on a Saturday at 1pm.
I was in the hospital within an hour, speedily transferred by ambulance to a stroke centre a few miles away and, after blood tests (in the first hospital) and a CT scan (at the second, where the blood-test results had already arrived), was diagnosed as having a small clot on the brain.
Since it was a clot, not a bleed - and a small one - I was offered treatment with Alteplase, which washes away the clot (the pluses and minuses were fully explained to me).
All symptoms were gone by that evening (but I was still monitored at very regular intervals through the night) - confirmed by the consultant on the Sunday morning and re-confirmed by a physiotherapist that afternoon.
I was discharged that evening, returning home by underground and taxi accompanied by my son.
Happily (and quite contrary to how I’d imagine things would turn out when the stroke happened), I have had zero stroke-related problems since that time.
Oh, and since this was in the UK - which offers health care free-at-point of delivery - none of this (and none of the follow-up checkups and care) cost me a thing.
Hate to think what the bill would have been if I lived in the USA and didn’t have first-rate medical insurance.
Update - May 2, 2020
My original answer referred to a stroke that happened in January 2018. Had another one in early January this year (2020), but considerably milder.
No need for Alteplase but what was thought to be a good idea - soon after I arrived in hospital - was to put a stent into my left carotid artery (up in the neck), which was somewhat clogged up. This took place under local anaethetic because I wasn’t “nil-by-mouth! - I had eaten fairly near the time when the procedure was to take place.
Weird hearing it all going on and feeling the doctors inserting this thing into an artery in my groin and thrusting upwards towards my brain (well, a bit short of there but in that general direction).
Sadly, although the stent went in place okay and seemingly has been doing a good job since then, nobody noticed that a substantial blood clot has been created where the work that had taken place down where the cut was made to get the stent in.
Very little blood was getting to my right leg or foot. When my left foot touched my right foot when I was in bed, it felt like it was resting on a piece of cold meat out of the fridge.
Upshot of that was I went straight back to the hospital that night and it was decided to do a rather big cutting job to completely clean out the artery.
That seems to have been successful, too, but the scar is a bit of horror show.
Cost?
Well, you know the answer to that - nothing."
3f587961,"How do you calculate BHP using MEP, stroke, and cylinder diameters in marine 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines in metric units?","Well let me start,
Work done = Pressure X change in displacement, so
W.D = (BMEP) x(Swept volume)
now Power = Work done / unit time
so P = (BMEP) x (swept volume) / (revs per which powerstroke occurs/current revs)
lets say P = (BMEP x Vs) / (z / N)
So, BEMP you already know. Vs you can compute from stroke and bore, Z=2 for four stroke & 1 for two stroke, but N you will definitely need. More N more the BMEP, its in direct proportion and hence no way to eliminate that in any formula conversion you do."
bd6f3554,"A four-stroke cycle engine may or may not have a pressure boost (supercharger, turbocharger) in the intake system. Why must a two-stroke cycle engine always have an intake pressure boost?","Two stroke small single cylinder engines don't have a supercharger but make use of the piston descending pressurising the crankcase to force the charge into the cylinder all others including diesels require a pressure to force air into the cylinder but why?
A two stroke does not have an intake stroke with suction.
When the piston ascends the crankcase depression draws in fresh air and fuel through a reed valve.
When the piston descends it is on a power stroke unless the engine has not yet started in which case the cylinder may have left over combustion gasses or air/fuel.
At or before BDC the exhaust port opens and moments later the inlet port opens.
The piston coming down pressurises the crankcase until the inlet port opens and this blows exhaust out the exhaust port but also is directed up to the top of the bore by the piston shape which also directs exhaust out of the exhaust port.
The piston starts moving up the bore closes the inlet then the exhaust and compresses the charge.
The charge is ignited near TDC and so starts the process again.
Multi cylinder or diesel two stroke.
If the multi cylinder petrol twostroke is treated as a number of single cylinder engines bolted together with separate crankcases the engine operates as above.
Multi cyl two stroke with common crankcase.
Each inlet port is connected to a common plenum pressurised to send air to any cylinder that has an open port.
Each cylinder inlet will open in sequence.
The exhaust ports are normally connected to an extractor style exhaust to reduce back pressure.
Best with port or direct injection.
Diesels normaly have a valve for either inlet or exhaust or can have opposed pistons with one piston opening the inlet port and the other opening the exhaust.
This provides good scavanging with inlet as far away from the exhaust as possible.
They cannot have crankcase pressure porting because of the danger of oil fumes which they would run on.
They all have a supercharger to pressurise the inlet and some also have a turbocharger."
8568511a,"The moment you have a stroke, do you know what is happening to you?","It was a Saturday afternoon I was in the garage, warming up to lift weights. After several minutes of jumping jacks, I felt tired, and wanted to sit down. As I was about to sit on the bench, my butt missed it, and I found myself on the floor, leaning against the bench. For some reason I felt extremely tired and unable to get up. I called my wife’s name, and thought I sounded different. She came out, and said she’s call our neighbor who was a cardiologist. Since I thought I was talking funny, and remembering an episode on House, M.D, about a patient with slurred speech, I asked her if my speech was slurred. She ignored me, and proceeded to call our neighbor friend cardiologist. He arrived, took my blood pressure which was 100 over 80 (pretty normal for me), and told my wife to take me to the Emergency Room of the hospital whose cardio dept he headed. My wife asked another of our neighbors to help drive me. I’m a pretty big guy, 5′10, and about 190 lbs. It took 3 of them to get me to our neighbor’s car.
On the drive to the hospital, I remember feeling really tired and sleepy. I wanted to sleep, but my wife kept me from falling asleep. When we arrived at the ER, I remember hearing someone say I was having a stroke. Nurses asked me questions, and I remember answering coherently (to my mind at least). After an MRI scan I was admitted to a room. The next day, I was moved via ambulance to another hospital which supposedly had a better neurological unit and better facilities.
So, yeah, I knew what was happening, but I didn’t know it was a stroke until hours later."
63eeab3b,What can I do to restore brain function to pre-stroke condition?,"Even for the smallest strokes, the maximum that you can get is to restore partially the function that you lost. My father had an stroke when he was young, and he lost some movement of the right part of his body. Some years after, he was able to walk and perform all motor tasks with no problem, but he stills limp with his right leg a little bit, and sometimes he lost the grip with his right hand (it occurs rarely, but it does occur).
The reason for that is due to the plasticity ability of adults neurons. Adult brain does not have many room for plasticity, and therefore it is impossible to completely restore a lost condition."
c6b01d9c,What is the difference between a 4 stroke and 2 stroke motor?,"A 4 stroke engine (most common) has an upstroke to expel the exhaust gas, a downstroke to suck in the gas-air mixture, an upstroke to compress the mixture, then, following the spark ignition, the power (down) stroke. A 2 stroke engine has the power stroke, at the end of which it draws in the gas/air mixure. After the up (compression) stroke, the spark plug fires and the power stroke begins again."
eaf0d767,After a four stroke engine has completed one full operating cycle how many degrees has the crankshaft rotated?,"On a four stroke engine, you have four actions that take place which are the “strokes”.
The first one is when the engine breaths in it’s air/fuel mixture, otherwise known as the “Intake stroke”. It starts with the piston a the very top and pulls all the way to the bottom (180 degrees).
Next the piston is pushed up to compress the air/fuel mixture, and as it said earlier this is called the “Compression stroke”. It started at the bottom and went all the way to the top so you get another 180 degrees (now we’re up to 360).
Next is where the fun starts. Now that the air/fuel mixture has been compressed and is at the top, the spark plug (on a gas engine) lights it off and the explosion shoves the piston back down to the bottom again. This is called the “Power Stroke”. Now you have another 180 degrees (now were up to 540).
The final one is called the “Exhaust Stroke”. All of the burn air/fuel mixture does have to discharged, so the piston pushes back up from the bottom all the way to the top again, which would be your finial 180 degrees bringing us to a total of (drum roll please) 720 degrees.
So what did we learn today? The four strokes of a four stoke engine are 1) Intake 2) compression 3) Power and 4) Exhaust ."
ec4ffc1f,Why is the 2-stroke engine more noisy than a 4-stroke engine?,"Air cooled 2 strokes have increased engine noise because of the thin cylinder walls.
Water cooled and air cooled 2 strokes are also louder because of the exhaust design.
2 stroke exhaust ports open near the end of combustion meaning some of the explosive energy is released into the exhaust increasing the amplitude of the pressure waves in the exhaust. The pressure wave in 2 stroke exhaust is used to help contain fresh air in the cylinder on the compression stroke through a tuned exhaust which reflects the pressure wave. Because of this tuned exhaust and firing on every revolution, 2 strokes have a pressure wave leave the exhaust twice for every rotation giving the high pitch sound. Now that high pitch sound combined with the high amplitude pressure waves combines with unrestricted exhausts to generate a high pitch high decibel level sound waves.
4 strokes fire once every other revolution and commonly have a more restricted exhaust allowing the exhaust gases a more gradual path allowing the pressure wave to form a lower amplitude, lower frequency wave at a lower decibel level."
a4400bb4,What are the telling symptoms of an oncoming stroke?,
8fa9b3f9,Why do you smell burnt toast before you have a stroke?,"The sudden presence of a smell associated with an event that is not in occurrence, is sometimes called a phantom smell, or phantosmia. Phantom smells may occur with any type of injury to the olfactory nerve or its brain origin, which could be due to trauma, stroke, seizures, tumors, or even migraines. To reiterate though, just because a person suddenly smells burnt toast doesn't mean they are having a stroke because there are several other conditions where phantosmia may occur (ie seizures, migraines, etc).
What IS important is that if you think you or someone is having a stroke, you must immediately call 911 and make sure you are taken to a Stroke Center! Its also important that you know and recognize stroke warning signs and symptoms using the American Stroke Associations's Spot a Stroke FAST!
Face drooping on one side or numbness
Arm weakness on one side or drifting down
Speech slurring or sounding strange
Time to call 911 now!
So while smell can be affected in stroke, other diseases can also cause abnormal smells. Its good to consider stroke if you suddenly smell burnt toast while shopping at the Macy's perfume counter, but its far more beneficial to learn how to spot a stroke FAST!
The additional signs & symptoms of stroke (sans phantosmia) are conveniently listed on the screen-shot of the StrokeApp."
d3973489,What is an ischemic stroke?,"Blood carries oxygen through our bodies and we need oxygen to live. Any part of the body that doesn’t receive oxygen gets injured and begins to die. This is called ischemia.
An ischemic stroke is a type of stroke that happens when there is a blockage that builds up in the blood vessels of the brain preventing blood or oxygen from flowing.
A blockage in blood vessels usually happens when it “clogs”.
The blood vessels to the brain are like pipes they carry water. Layers of mold and “gunk” can buildup over many years. The same kind of build-up can happen in a person’s arteries.
Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood FROM the heart TO the brain.
Similar to the mold or “gunk” that clogs the pipes, there is far the clogs the arteries.
This is called atherosclerosis.
Sometimes the blockage builds up in the blood vessels of the chest or neck, which then breaks loose and travels up to the brain. This is called an embolus. (CLICK HERE TO SEE VIDEO OF EMBOLIC

707d56dd,What is the best neuroimaging modality for acute ischemic stroke?,"One of the most useful ways to image acute stroke is a combination of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) with perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI). Diffusion weighting is about actually imaging how ""free"" water molecules are in a certain region of tissue (and it depends on how much water there is as well). You can think of it as looking at tissue microstructure by evaluating how tissue water is behaving. When tissue dies and you have an ischemic infarct, diffusion goes way down. However, there are still areas surrounding the infarcted region that are viable but aren't getting sufficient blood perfusion. perfusion weighting helps show those regions, as it actually looks at how much fresh blood supply is entering into a region. Quickly re-perfusing those regions that are still viable but are inadequately perfused is critical to saving that tissue and preventing the lesion of infarcted tissue from growing, which increases chances for functional recovery. It's a very short time window to really help the stroke patient in this way at this acute phase ...
See: http://radiology-medical-imaging-technology.blogspot.com/2012/12/perfusion-imaging-of-infarct-and.html
Here's a brief comparison between information you glean from DWI and information you glean from PWI in ischemic stroke:

e55c5e3a,What is the best treatment for an ischemic stroke?,"Well, there are two timeframes for treatment: the acute phase (while you’re in the hospital) and afterwards.
The immediate treatment is TPA, if you’re eligible for it; that breaks up the clot. If you haven’t gotten to the hospital in time for TPA, the next best thing is heparin. Heparin prevent your blood from clotting and helps prevent any further clots from forming.
Once you’re out of the hospital, you’ll probably want to see a physiatrist (“rehab doctor”). She will ask you:
*How’s your sleep? If it’s not good, she will probably prescribe one of several sleeping pills. N.B. That these did not help me; Ambien gave me such terrible nightmares that I swore I would never touch it again, Lunesta gave me terrible breath, and Rozerem didn’t so squat. I would approach ALL these drugs with caution.
I *did* see a neurologist whom I respected who recommended melatonin. She said you can double or even triple the dose and it should make you sleepy. Which I do, and it does, but though it makes you sleeepy, that doesn’t always translate to falling asleep. Please use at your own risk and don’t take my word for it — ask your doctor!
*How’s your mood? Post-stroke depression is pretty common. It interferes with your sleep and your energy. If you’re depressed, she will most certainly put you on anti-depressants. In my case, this was a godsend; I eventually tried Wellbutrin, which woke me up when nothing else would. Hooray!
*How’s your energy? In my case, it was terrible. I felt like one of those mosquitos that got stuck in amber and eventually suffocated. My physiatrist tried a whole bunch of stuff — Ritalin, Adderall, modanifil, Aricept — most of which either didn’t work, make me suicidally depressed (that was modanifil), or made me feel “weird”. It wasn’t until I discovered Wellbutrin that I began to feel like myself again!
Ten years after all *that* went by, I discovered a doctor in Chicago who treats the brain by treating your eyes. The whole story is outlined in the book “The Ghost In My Brain” by Clark Elliott, but the bottom line is that her method WORKS. I have even had some days where I feel like a 9/10 — the best I’ve felt since the strokes, about three times better than I felt right after the strokes, and twice as good as I ever expected to feel again. Her name is Dr. Zelinsky. Please check her out!"
d669d233,Do hemorrhagic strokes only happen after ischemic strokes?,"Nope.
Ischemic strokes can convert into a hemorrhagic stroke (estimated 20–40% risk 1 week after ictus) , but hemorrhagic strokes can also occur from various other etiologies including (but not limited to):
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (i.e. aneurysm, trauma, AVM rupture, cavernomas, and other vascular malformations)
Hypertensive strokes (lacunar bleeds)
Amyloid angiopathy (and other vasculidities)
Intracranial neoplasm/tumors
Coagulopathy
Iatrogenic (i.e. anticoagulant therapy)"
739a4602,What is an ischemic stroke in the pons?,"The pons is a very important part of the brain stem. It is an important pathway for messages traveling from the brain to other parts of the body and for messages from other parts of the body traveling to the brain. The pons has many important structures including the cranial nerve nuclei that help in movement of the facial nerves, detecting sensations on the face and also help in movement of the eyes. The cerebellum which is the balance center of the brain also communic extensively with the pons.
The pons is supplied by an important main artery called the basilar artery and it's branches called the perforators.
An overwhelming majority of ischemic strokes to the pons entail blockage of these perforators and produce a variety of symptoms depending on the area that is damaged. Usually there is weakness of one side of the face causing a facial droop, weakness of one side of the body (paralysis) imbalance and difficulty swallowing. Patients tend to do better with rehabilitation
Rarely, the main arter, the basilar artery may get blocked causing a devastating stroke causing a locked in syndrome wherein the entire body is paralyzed except for the ability to move the eyes up and down."
82b829a3,Why is ischemic stroke more likely in Covid-19 than respiratory flu patients?,"Very good question, lets explore this further, for example, an early study focused on cerebrovascular disease (CVD),
in a cohort of 219 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 11 (5.0%) developed new onset of CVD following COVID-19 infection. Of these patients, 10 (90.9%) were diagnosed with ischaemic stroke and 1 (9.1%) had intracerebral haemorrhage.
Another study
which got the attention of doctors came from New York, Dr. Thomas Oxley wasn’t even on call the day he received the page to come to Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. There weren’t enough doctors to treat all the emergency stroke patients, and he was needed in the operating room.
The patient’s chart appeared unremarkable at first glance. He took no medications and had no history of chronic conditions. He had been feeling fine, hanging out at home during the lockdown like the rest of the country, when suddenly, he had trouble talking and moving the right side of his body. Imaging showed a large blockage on the left side of his head.
Oxley gasped when he got to the patient’s age and covid-19 status: 44, positive.
The man was among several recent stroke patients in their 30s to 40s who were all infected with the coronavirus. The median age for that type of severe stroke is 74.
As Oxley, an interventional neurologist, began the procedure to remove the clot, he observed something he had never seen before. On the monitors, the brain typically shows up as a tangle of black squiggles — “like a can of spaghetti,” he said — that provide a map of blood vessels. A clot shows up as a blank spot. As he used a needlelike device to pull out the clot, he saw new clots forming in real-time around it.
“This is crazy,” he remembers telling his boss.
Common laboratory findings in patients with coronavirus disease COVID-19 are very revealing and could help us understand a mechanism of Ischemic stroke.
Lymphopenia, a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, is a common lab finding in confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as neutrophilia, an increase in circulating neutrophils. Elevated serum ALT and AST, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated CRP and elevated ferritin levels are associated with more severe disease. Elevated D-dimer, rising levels of Procalcitonin are other findings in severe cases.
Inflammation has been increasingly recognized as a key contributor to the pathophysiology of CVDs and involved in the acute intravascular events triggered by the interruption of the blood supply. Several studies have reported the elevated levels of C-reactive proteins (CRPs) and D-dimer in patients with the coexistence of COVID-19.
Caveats to summarize the findings:
Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyperstimulated macrophages and neutrophils.
Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Platelet-Lymphocyte ratio (PLR) correlate with thrombus burden in Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVM) and predicts Large Vessel Occlusions (LVO) that causes the deadliest type of stroke. Angiopoietins could be playing a significant role in blood and lymphatic endothelial cells (EC), in particular, Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) expression is triggered by inflammatory mediators, such as thrombin, and conditions, such as hypoxia and cancer. Angiopoietin also plays a role in smooth muscle cells, and microvascular thrombosis.
While the role of Ang2 in regulating angiogenesis and vascular integrity has been well recognized, elevated serum angiopoietin-2 and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been implicated as biomarkers in the role in inflammation, in particular, Ang2 expression is increased dramatically at the sites of endothelial activation and is induced by various cytokines. Ang2 plays a critical role in hypoxia-induced lung injury and inflammation. Ang2 blockage inhibited expression of EC adhesion molecules, can improve blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity.
Elevated serum ferritin levels in severe or critically ill patients is definitely an interesting biomarker as this could explain regulated cell death via a process called ferroptosis. Iron-mediated oxidative stress has been implicated in a wide variety of neurological disorders, including hemorrhagic stroke, Alzheimer, Parkinson and diffuse Lewy body diseases.
In COVID-19 cases human airway epithelial-endothelial cells (air-blood barrier) were interrupted by lipid signals, such as 15-HpETE-PE, which plays a triggering role in ferroptosis. ACE2 receptors are also expressed by both cells, with evidence of direct viral infection of the endothelial cell and diffuse endothelial inflammation leading to cell death.
As the SARS-CoV viral load increases in the body, not only does it affect the immune system, it “attacks” via the ACE2 receptors, aided by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease, it affects cells in lungs, kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract, leading to multi-organ dysfunction. It also affects the red blood cells, causing hypoxia.
Autophagy is activated in suboptimal conditions such as hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) or amino acid starvation. Alterations in oxygenation are common, reducing cell viability including by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and oxidative stress, leading to irreversible oxidation and damage of proteins, DNA and lipids, release of cyctochrome c and activation of apoptotic pathways.
Further analysis also show that many targets of autophagy modulators are involved in apoptosis (e.g. p53, Bcl-2, and caspase 8), necroptosis (e.g. caspase 8, RIPK1, and TNF), and ferroptosis (e.g. p53, 15LOX, and ACSL4) pathways.
Brain swelling in the cortex/hippocampal region is also found to contain higher iron levels. As the iron chelator, Deferoxamine (DFX), reduces brain swelling induced by hemoglobin, iron appears to be an important factor in hemoglobin-induced injury. Cellular edema may contribute to brain swelling, but the main form of edema formation after Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is vasogenic brain edema. Studies have shown that hemoglobin can cause death of endothelial cells and a significant disruption of the BBB. This explains why Glucocorticoids, particularly, Dexamethasone (Dex) works well in severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients, coordinately regulating, an increase in angiopoietin-1 and decrease in VEGF thereby stabilizing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to an attenuation of vasogenic brain edema. Angiopoietin-1 protects neurons by inhibiting autophagy after neuronal oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery injury from apoptosis.
In one recent study, Dex attenuated the elevated nitric oxide production and decreased the inducible isoform nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) mRNA expression by kainate treatment, possibly acting as a free radical scavenger.
After ischemic stroke, cytotoxic edema is first observed within a few hours and then declines within 1 day. Conversely, vasogenic edema forms within two to three days and is maintained for several days, after ICH.
Since the oxygen-glucose supply for brain cells is remarkably diminished by deterioration of the blood brain flow after cerebral ischemia, which causes a drop in intracellular ATP production, and pH, switching to anaerobic glycolysis with lactic acid production. We hypothesize the electron transport respiratory chain is disrupted by mitochondrial dysfunction. This could also explain cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors in older patients.
Pharmacological interventions in the Future
To date there have been no clinical studies on Edaravone in COVID-19.
Edaravone has been implicated as a safe and effective drug for acute ischemic stroke according to studies conducted by the COCRANE review in a cohort of 496 participants.
Since Edaravone has a similar pharmacological mechanism in ischemic stroke to Dex, we highly recommend a study of this drug in severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19.
The following combination therapies could prove to be effective in prolonging the quality of life.
Edaravone + Anti-viral (lipinovir/ritonavir)
or
Edaravone + Deferoxamine (DFX)
or
Edaravone + Dex (Patient with Diabetes)
or
Edaravone + Ang2 inhibitor (Patient with Heart disease)"
a75740bd,"What is the difference between a hemorrhagic stroke, an ischemic stroke, and a transient ischemia stroke?","There are changing names for these things but I will try to answer
A stroke is an infarction of brain tissue killing it in the center of the tissue and leaving a margin around the death of semi living tissue. Strokes have different causes. Ischemic , lack of oxygen , or embolic, also lack of oxygen but caused by a small clot that flew into the brain artery and blocked blood flow. Tumors and foreign bodies can cause blockages as well.
If this blockage lasts more than about 15 minutes it it pretty certain that part of the brain tissue will die. Dead brain means loss of the nerves in that part of the brain.
How long does this blockage last ?
Does the part of the brain have some rapid alternative blood supply?
Will the clot dissolve before it kills brain tissue and restores some blood supply. ?
What happens to dead brain tissue ?
A Reversible Ischemic neurological deficit (RIND, or TIA,). Has usually meant that neurological loss is temporary and has mostly recovered to normal within 24 hours. ( this may be old school speak ).
A completed Stroke is a neurological deficit that lasts more than 24 hours. It may change and improve a bit but it leaves residual neurological loss .
Hemorrhagic stroke can be several things.
The dead tissue bleeds into itself or expands and hurts other tissue
The small brain artery actually bursts and blood into brain tissue that expands and puts pressure on normal brain tissue. This is often because of a brain aneurism. ( like a small defect in the Artery that forms a balloon in the vessel and it bursts )"
55d87e69,What is the average lifespan of an ischemic stroke victim?,"The causes are blood clots blocking blood flow in the brain. Most people if treated early experience varying degrees of recovery, especially with physical therapy. Nothing I read specified a life span expectation. I gather that would depend on how early treatment begins and the health otherwise of the person affected."
d88bbdcb,Can ischemic strokes & hemorrhagic strokes be differentiated without MRI & CT scan? Should a stroke patient be given aspirin by the emergency department?,"For the first question
Answer- Yes
Details- Yes, only if you can-
Show us through a video call/ bring the patient to the ER immediately to show, the progression of onset of stroke.
Answer all our questions while we ask for the history and you do not get pissed off for probing at minute details
We actually can't trust you to do any of these, and jumbling up of treatment protocols for ischaemic and hemorrhagic stroke can be catastrophic. Hence, we do the CT or MRI (depending on indications and contraindications) before deciding on definitive treatment/doing course correction in emergency management.
For the second question
Answer- NO
Details- No, because we don't know the type of stroke, and giving aspirin to a patient of hemorrhagic stroke can be catastrophic. Aspirin is given only in ischaemic stroke."
74cdd7c3,Is there a link between sinusitis and ischemic stroke?,"I believe so, yes.
Sinusitis can cause man you problems. My cousin had it so bad that his eyes were nearly pushed out of his skull and surgeons had to place a drain in his forehead to remove pus and keep the swelling to a minimum.
But in the case of it being the possible cause of an ischemic stroke, I can see how it’s possible. Due to the buildup of pressure in the skull, disrupting blood flow to the brain.
I think there are studies on this, too, but I can’t look them up right now. I remember reading one that said CRS (Chronic Rhinosinusitis) does, in fact, raise the risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. I think it said something about the patient’s age not mattering, either - that it can cause these problems whether you’re young and healthy, or old and vulnerable."
5c24c852,How long will it take an ischemic stroke to recover?,"An aneurism, called a stroke since olden days, when it was believed you were stricken by a supernatural deity, is a lack of blood getting to parts of the brain. “Ischaemic”, means lack of blood. Asking how long it takes to recover is totally dependent on how serious the aneurism is. Transient Ischaemic Attacks or TIA are relatively minor and effects last about 24 hours with no permanent damage, but aneurisms can also kill immediately. In between TIA and a killer attack are a whole range of aneurisms.
For anyone, who has a stroke, suitable pills will be prescribed and the patient may last as long as Kirk Douglas, who is about to turn 101 years old and who had an aneurism about 30 years ago."

a14d52d0,What is the treatment for an ischemic stroke?,"An ischemic stroke, as opposed to a hemorhagic stroke…well, if you have to have one, that’s the one to pick. Your odds of surviving it are much better! The first one is a clot and the other is a bleed. So, the treat it first by locating it preferably as soon as they are aware of its existance. Clots can be a little dangerous. You don’t want it floating off into some place dangerous and getting stuck, causing damage. If they determine that this clot is one they can safely break down without causing you harm, they give you medicine to do so. If not, they will sometimes remove it surgically. The biggest danger is when the clot lodges in the heart, lungs or brain. Things can get scary then. Some hospitals have whole wings for dealing with that! They also often have two nurses per bed for the people with those issues and the ones with the hemorrhagics. They get even scarier. But, you have enough to deal with I bet. I’m hoping it is just a school quiz."
091784f5,What is the etiology of ischemic stroke (TIA)?,
93dd5638,What is the difference between an ischemic stroke and a hemorrhagic stroke?,"Stroke is defined as a specific area of neurological insufficiency due to a lesion in vascular system. Its onset is usually rapid and it may last for more than 24 hours. Patient may or may not survive during this episode. It presents as weakness of any area of body with or without disturbance of speech. It usually occurs after the age of 40 years. It is more common in males as compared to females. Its risk factors are non- modifiable which include age, gender, hereditary and previous history of stroke. Others are modifiable and include hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes, high blood cholesterol level and heart failure. Stroke is divided into two groups. One is hemorrhagic and other is ischemic stroke.
It occurs due to rupture of an artery. It has two types. One is intra-cerebral hemorrhage which occurs due to rupture of small arteries which are already weakened by hypertension. It can be fatal as compression of brain can occur. Second type is sub-arachnoid hemorrhage which develops due to rupture of major artery at the level of brain. This type of hemorrhage is characterized by sudden onset of headache, difficulty in movements of eyes, nausea and vomiting. History of patient who presents with stroke is important to determine the cause and progression of this disease.
Ischemic stroke occurs due to blockage of a major artery ultimately leading to decreased blood flow to the brain resulting in damage to brain cells which is called ‘cerebral infarction’. Arteries may be occluded due to thrombosis in intracranial or extra-cranial arteries or embolism from somewhere outside the brain especially heart. Once deprived of blood supply, brain tissues undergo sudden death within a few minutes. Damaged tissues are then filed up with fluid after some hours, which cause more damage and impair further blood flow

e9951af9,What is the most common cause of an ischemic stroke?,"A blood clot. Now how do you get such a clot to your brain is the real question. Your Dr. might check to see if you have a ‘hole in your heart or maybe like me your blood clots too quickly. I have a genetic blood disorder, called Factor V deficiency. Which basically means my blood clots too quickly. So after my stroke I was put on blood thinners for the rest of my life"
3cc8bc8a,Why would a decompressive craniectomy be necessary for an ischemic stroke?,"Mostly because the brain is housed in a rigid bony container.
The pressures inside that container can go up rapidly if say a tumor or blood starts to expand and take up space. This puts healthy brain tissue at risk because 1. above a certain pressure blood flow stops and 2. healthy brain is being pushed against the skull or squeezed through narrow openings.
In the case of stroke the following can happen
This is malignant MCA syndrome. There is a blockage in the middle cerebral artery which supplies blood to much of the cerebrum. The large dark swelling on the right side of the CT scan (the left side of the patient’s brain) is dead brain tissue. Irreversibly so. These dead cells swell and leak fluid. I think you can appreciate how this edema is pushing the entire brain to one side, with crowding and distortion of the part of the brain that isn’t already irreversibly injured.
Craniectomy removes part of the skull, creating room for the dead brain tissue to swell. This minimizes damage to healthy brain. The decision to do this surgery is quite challenging - as you can imagine the patient has already suffered a devastating stroke, and outcomes from someone requiring this surgery are usually quite poor, particularly if they are older and have other medical problems."
7008713a,Is the president required to report the fact if he is diagnosed with recurring ischemic strokes?,"An ischemic strokes fells you. And recurrent ischemic strokes, you are not up and walking. You are paralyzed and may lose your ability to speak at all. I think you mean mini-strokes These generally are short-lived and don’t leave lasting damage. They can however, be a precursor to a full-blown stroke. I don’t know if reporting mini-strokes is required."
595f13c5,Do ambulances and paramedics carry clot-busting drugs such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to treat people suffering ischemic strokes?,"Not knowing the full scope of practice for every service in the world, I can't definitively say yes or no, but I would say it is highly unlikely except in specialist cases.
The reason for this is that there are 2 causes of stroke. Ischemic stroke is a blocked artery that will be treated by a clot busting drug with good effect and positive outcomes. Hemorrhagic stroke is a burst artery causing issues because the blood is leaking out before reaching the affected tissue. Clot busting drugs prevent this bleed sealing itself, leading to the patient bleeding out, which is, needless to say, a particularly negative outcome.
The problem is that in the field, they are indistinguishable based on signs and symptoms. A CT scan is required to determine the cause of the stroke. So paramedics are somewhat loathe to go pumping clot busting drugs into stroke patients in the field, because for all intents and purposes you've got a 50:50 call on either fixing the problem or killing the patient, without even factoring in the other potential complications. So unless they are working on a dedicated stroke ambulance with a portable CT in the back, they are almost certainly not carrying clot busters for strokes."

Longitudinal Brain Atrophy Rates in Transient
Ischemic
Attack and Minor
Ischemic
Stroke
Patients and Cognitive Profiles
Introduction: Patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke demonstrate cognitive impairment, and a four-fold risk of late-life dementia.
Aim: To study the extent to which the rates of brain volume loss in TIA patients differ from healthy controls and how they are correlated with cognitive impairment.
TIA and minor stroke patients experience a significantly higher rate of whole brain atrophy when compared with people not affected by stroke.
Results: Whole brain atrophy rates were calculated for the TIA and minor stroke patients; n = 38 between 24 h and 18 months, and n = 68 participants between 18 and 36 months, and were compared to healthy controls. TIA and minor stroke patients demonstrated a significantly higher whole brain atrophy rate than healthy controls over a 3 years interval (p = 0.043). Diabetes (p = 0.012) independently predicted higher atrophy rate across groups. There was a relationship between higher rates of brain atrophy and processing speed (composite P = 0.047 and digit symbol coding P = 0.02), but there was no relationship with brain atrophy rates and memory or executive composite scores or individual cognitive tests for language (Boston naming, memory recall, verbal fluency or Trails A or B score).
Conclusion: TIA and minor stroke patients experience a significantly higher rate of whole brain atrophy. In this cohort of TIA and minor stroke patients changes in brain volume over time precede cognitive decline."
d106aec0,What is the most common current treatment for patients admitted with suspected acute ischemic stroke?,"Aspirin and rehabilitation. Bleeds and symbolic strokes are considerably less common than the usual thrombotic strokes. Of the latter, most don't prevent themselves for treatment until more aggressive treatments are no longer options. Within a narrow time window, thrombolytic therapy is often used, but even after a quarter century of experience, we aren't completely sure who's going to benefit and who's going to be harmed, so it still isn't “standard of care"" in anybody. And the same can certainly be said for the newer, more invasive, treatment, which at any rate aren't widely available."
f8c8d269,"I had an ischemic stroke about a week ago, and I feel like I get mentally exhausted easily. How long is this likely to last for?","I cannot speak for cases in general, but I can speak for my own experience. I had a major ischemic stroke (3 years ago), and was paralyzed on the left side. I first focused on physical rehab, since my boss at work understood my situation and didn't expect me be back at work within a few weeks. Back then, I was also easily mentally exhausted: within a few minutes of reading anything, I felt confused, tired, and had something like a brain fog.
So I worked hard on my physical rehab through various exercises. At first they were really difficult. After finishing an hour's session, I wanted to just plop into bed and just sleep. But eventually, they became tolerable and I didn't need to nap after anymore.
But I did notice that as I got stronger physically, my mental endurance slowly got better, too.
I forgot to mention that when I consulted my neurologist, I asked if I could drink coffee to help with the lack of mental stimulation. He allowed me up to 3 cups a day. But pls consult your own doctor, as he may have a different opinion.
All in all, I think it took me about 5–6 months to get back to”acceptable” mental endurance. By this “acceptable”, I mean being able to go back to 8 hour work in the day time then going to school at night to pursue my PhD. But I pushed it, meaning, I had to talk myself into slowly working longer and longer….
I hope that helps.

You don’t say what you mean by getting worse. It could be that the person is simply realizing that the deficits are real or that they are getting tired of all the therapy appointments, or that post-stroke pain (common after thalamic strokes) has set in.
Post stroke pain hit as sensation started returning to my affected side, about two months post-stroke. One side is burning, tingling and numb — all at the same time — 24 hours per day, every day. I recently went to a clinic that specializes in neuropathic pain. That really helped. They understood what I was talking about and listed options. No other doctor had.
I also have hemi-ataxia which causes clumsiness on one side of my body. That affects my balance. I’m still doing Physical Therapy exercises as well as Occupational Therapy exercises. I do a round of sessions with my PT and/or OT a few times each year as my condition changes.

eac240b6,How is it determined if a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic?,"When a patient comes do the Emergency Room with an acute neurological deficit and the probable diagnosis is a stroke, the first exam to be performed is a CT scan to exclude intracranial haemorrhage, which would preclude thrombolysis; to look for any ""early"" signs of infarction; and to exclude other intracranial pathologies that may mimic a stroke, such as tumour.
The first signs of an ischemic stroke may be very subtle and include:
1. A hyperdense segment of a vessel, most communly observed in the middle cerebral artery. It's the earliest sign visible in the CT.
2. Loss of grey-white matter differentiation, and hypoattenuation of deep nuclei, as well as cortical hypodensity with associated parenchymal swelling with resultant gyral effacement. Visible in the first 1-3 hours.
3. Progressive hypo-attenuation and swelling In the first week.
4. And finally, after months, we can see an image of low density, with no mass effect, such as the following:
On the other hand, acute brain haemorrhage appears hyperdense (white) on CT scans, as we can see in the image below:

There are many kinds of intracranial haemorrhage and a long list of images you can get based in the artery affected by an ischemic stroke (all with different clinical onsets). The basic image differences between those two are described above, but if you decide to take a deeper look into the subject, Neurology can be very fascinating.

I was shocked to read (months later) that 40%–50% of hemorrhagic strokes are fatal within the first 30 days. The neurologist told my husband and daughter that if I survived the first night, I’d probably be ok. Thank goodness, I didn’t hear that! The neurologist said that blood is toxic to brain cells. The blood-brain barrier is why the brain is “grey matter”, not red. In my stroke, the blood flowed into one of the ventricles, so the damage to my grey matter was limited.
I’ve read that hemorrhagic stroke is more common in younger people. In this context “young” means under 60. That made me smile — it has been quite a while since anyone said I was young. :)
Exercise almost every day. Don’t smoke. Manage your blood pressure and cholesterol. Avoiding a stroke is far better than surviving any type of stroke."

d0e9c340,Does the ischemic brain stroke lead to cerebral dementia (partial loss of reasoning)?,"That’s not an easy question to answer.
It would seem intuitive that, for a brain disorder such as stroke, clinical assessment should include the examination of memory, thinking, and mood. However, until quite recently, the focus has been on the physical manifestations of stroke, and neuropsychological aspects have received far too little attention. There is now mounting evidence that cognitive impairment after stroke is a significant contributor to disability, and its prevalence tends to increase sharply with advancing age. However, studies on the prevalence, course, and prognosis of poststroke cognitive disorders have produced wildly conflicting results. In fact, the symptoms of poststroke cognitive impairment are not well defined, and are misunderstood and misdiagnosed by many clinicians.
This post is quite long, because I'm not sure what you're really asking. It's divided into three main sections, to make it easier to find the information you want:
(1) What categories of cognitive impairment can be caused by ischemic brain stroke?
Stroke can have a wide range of effects on brain function, from mild poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) to overt poststroke dementia (PSD). Our understanding of these effects is undergoing rapid change, This section discusses the current terminology used in the recent research literature, and how each category of impairment is defined.
(2) Whether, when, and why will cognitive dysfunction (PSCI and/or PSD) occur after an ischemic stroke?
Does ischemic brain stroke always cause cognitive impairment? No. This section discusses the frequency with which each type of impairment is caused in stroke survivors, how soon after stroke the impairment is seen, and some of the factors affecting a given stroke survivor's likelihood of suffering long-term cognitive impairment.
(3) What sorts of behavioral changes can be caused by poststroke cognitive impairment?
Both sections (1) and (2) might just be technobabble to the layman who's never encountered what stroke can do, other than the obvious physical difficulties such as a paralyzed arm. It occurred to me that you might really be wondering whether the strange behaviors of a loved one were actually caused by stroke, or by something else. This third section describes the more common, and some of the more unusual, behavioral changes that stroke can cause.
(1) What categories of cognitive impairment can be caused by ischemic brain stroke?
The terminology surrounding poststroke cognitive impairment is changing, so let's start there, for clarity.
The term ""vascular cognitive impairment (VCI)"" has been proposed as an umbrella term to recognize the broad spectrum of cognitive and behavioral changes associated with vascular pathology. The most common causes of VCI are small-vessel disease, large-vessel disease, and strategic infarcts that may be either cortical or subcortical. VCI may also be the result of hypoperfusion, hemorrhage, and hereditary conditions (for example, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, CADASIL). All of these subtypes of VCI may appear poststroke. Even when poststroke dementia (PSD) and poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) are not purely vascular in origin, they can at least partly be regarded as categories of VCI.
Poststroke dementia (PSD) is defined as any dementia occurring after stroke, including vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, other neurodegenerative dementias, or mixed dementia. (Note that vascular lesions often coexist with Alzheimer's disease pathology and other lesions, and the presence of multiple pathologies greatly increases the odds of dementia.) The concepts PSD and PSCI usually refer to conditions occurring after symptomatic strokes with corresponding ischemic findings on neuroradiological imaging. However, seemingly asymptomatic strokes – a common incidental finding in patients both with and without symptomatic strokes – add to the vascular burden of the brain and can affect cognitive function. Dementia can even be caused by non-focal neurological changes found in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA).
Poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is a common and under-recognised problem that may eventually lead to dementia (PSD). Two major issues hampering PSCI research include the lack of a clear-cut definition and a lack of highly specific and sensitive screening tools that accurately predict PSCI. PCSI is currently defined as failure in any cognitive domain after stroke, including attention and processing speed (sustained attention, divided attention, selective attention, information processing speed); frontal-executive function (planning, decision making, working memory, responding to feedback/error correction, novel situations, overriding habits, mental flexibility, judgment); learning and memory (immediate memory, recent memory -- including free recall, cued recall -- and recognition memory); language (naming, expressive, grammar and syntax, receptive); visuoconstructional-perceptual ability (construction, visual perception, and reasoning); praxis-gnosis-body schema (praxis, gnosis, right/left orientation, calculation ability, body schema, facial recognition); and/or social cognition (recognition of emotions and social cues, appropriate social inhibitions, theory of mind, empathy.)
However, studies on the prevalence and progression of PSCI vary wildly as to the number of domains that must be impaired, the number of tests per domain, how domains are defined, and specific cut-offs used to define impairment. Early definitions of PSCI were based on the concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), primarily framed as a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. (Note that there are several different types of MCI; and two-thirds of MCI patients will not progress to Alzheimer's.) The definition of MCI (and, accordingly, earlier definitions of PSCI) often requires intact basic activities of daily living (ADLs). However, stroke patients often have substantial physical impairments that interfere with ADLs, independent of cognitive function. Therefore, it has recently been recommended that requirements for intact ADLs should be specific to instrumental ADLs (IADLs) that are associated with cognition (e.g. managing money). This is consistent with the recent DSM-5 criteria which emphasize impairment in IADLs as a distinguishing factor between major and minor neurocognitive disorders. The new criteria also do not require memory impairment as a core symptom of PSCI or PSD. In stroke, it may be possible to have severely disabling cognitive problems but still retain memory. This latter change will be a major leap forward in studying and understanding poststroke cognitive function.
Even without progression to PSD, milder levels of cognitive impairment may result in reduced participation in rehabilitation and poor adherence to treatment. PSCI predicts suboptimal recovery in activities of daily living, which in turn results in a lower quality of life (and a heavier burden on caregivers.)
(2) Whether, when, and why will cognitive dysfunction (PSCI and/or PSD) occur after an ischemic stroke?
The studies that have been conducted on neuropsychological aspects of stroke have produced conflicting results. Various studies have concluded that some stroke survivors may show no cognitive deficits, whereas the cognitive function of others may decline, initially decline and then improve, decline and then remain stable, and/or may progress to dementia over time. How many stroke survivors follow each of these poststroke profiles is unknown, since different studies reached widely different conclusions. The differences in prevalence and progression reported by different researchers may be related to differences in the diagnostic criteria (see above), the cognitive tests used, the timing of the testing (i.e., how soon after stroke the first cognitive testing is done, and how frequently follow-up testing is done, and long the follow-up period is), history of previous stroke, stroke location, the volume of the lesion, the presence of large‐ and small‐vessel disease, population sample (clinical- versus population-based, ages, gender, etc), inclusion/exclusion criteria for those patients to be tested, ethnicity, and the presence of neurodegenerative pathology. In some patients, the initial poststroke cognitive state may reflect prestroke cognitive decline or delirium. On top of all of this, some researchers have concluded that cognitive outcome following a stroke is dependent on sociodemographic, health, and stroke‐related risk factors, not just on the properties of the stroke itself and the overall pre-stroke vascular burden of the brain.
For example, population or sampling characteristics, such as study setting (hospital or community), inclusion of patients with recurrent stroke, or inclusion of patients with pre-stroke cognitive impairment or dementia, can lead to variation in estimates of PSCI or PSD prevalence. Exclusion of patients who have difficulty undergoing cognitive testing (e.g., have severe aphasia due to the stroke) may be unavoidable, but can also effect prevalence estimates. Some publications state that up to 78% of patients show some cognitive deficits within 1 month after the stroke. However, delirium is quite common in the days and weeks immediately following a stroke. (Studies have reported an incidence of delirium as high as 48% in the acute phase of stroke.) Delirium, which has a rapid onset, is a serious disturbance in mental abilities that results in confused thinking and reduced awareness of the environment. Because symptoms of delirium and dementia can be similar, diagnosis of one in the presence of the other can be tricky. Ergo, erroneously high figures for the prevalence of cognitive deficits may be produced by studies that assess cognitive function within a month or two of the stroke; and those that went on to conduct additional assessments months later might have reported initial cognitive decline followed by some degree of recovery, whereas what was actually being observed was the resolution of the delirium. Most of the higher quality studies did not attempt to establish baseline poststroke cognition until three months after the stroke.
One of the biggest flaws is the method(s) used to evaluate cognitive function. Even though there is an enormous amount of evidence that domain-specific cognitive tools are essential to capture the impact of PSCI and/or PSD, the vast majority of studies have relied exclusively on short, simple screening tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and/or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). There are far too many factors that can affect the outcome of these simplistic tests for either one to be used to diagnose cognitive impairment, let alone estimate its severity. Both tests were initially developed to quickly screen for the possibility of Alzheimer's in outpatient settings rather than to identify cognitive defects in stroke patients. These tests have low sensitivity for the most commonly affected cognitive domains after stroke, such as executive function and processing speed. Moreover, PSCI is usually accompanied by additional cognitive deficits, such as aphasia/language dysfunction, vision loss, apraxia and spatial neglect, for which the tests are not sensitive and may greatly underestimate cases of cognitive impairment involving specific neurological deficits (e.g., aphasia). A 2019 systematic review on the cognitive screening tools used in the diagnosis of PSCI concluded that studies on PSCI have relied almost exclusively on nonspecific cognitive screening tools; that it is very well established that they are hopelessly inadequate for this purpose; and that a comprehensive standardized battery of neuropsychological tests is needed to fully capture the effects of stroke on cognitive function; even multidomain screening tools such as the new Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) are superior for the diagnosis of PSD and PSCI.
Keeping all of this in mind, studies have generally concluded that, six months poststroke, roughly half of stroke survivors have neurocognitive disorders, two-thirds of whom have PSCI, and one-third of whom have PSD. Due to the inadequacies of the assessment tools that have been used, the prevalence of PSCI and PSD are undoubtedly higher. A study involving a population free from pre-stroke cognitive decline found that 57% suffered from cognitive impairment one year after stroke, only one third of whom developed a purely vascular cognitive disease. Poststroke cognitive impairment in the remainder was complex with a high coexistence of vascular and degenerative changes.
Temporal aspects of cognitive impairment in patients (e.g., whether patients remain stable, improve, or decline) have often been ignored. Most of the studies that attempted to address this essential feature used screening tools such as the MMSE to judge the severity of cognitive problems. As noted above, the MMSE was never intended for this purpose and is hopelessly inadequate for it, despite its widespread use. Moreover, many studies have been cross-sectional, which are inadequate for addressing temporal aspects -- only longitudinal studies yield accurate information on progression. Finally, as more is learned about poststroke cognitive function, it becomes clear that a relatively long follow-up is needed to fully capture the impact of a stroke on the brain. Acute stroke may cause both a sudden cognitive decline and accelerated cognitive decline that is persistent over time. Very recent studies have concluded that cognitive function can decline in a delayed fashion, suggesting an indirect, more gradual onset rather than (or in addition to) a direct, sudden onset; any study with a short follow-up time period is unlikely to capture the full extent of a delayed decline. Delayed decline has been reported in approximately one‐third of patients. Several reasonably reliable studies with follow-up periods as long as five years have concluded that the delayed development of incident dementia remains up to 9 times greater than among an age-matched population for ≥5 years after stroke. Decline in cognitive function, however, is not inevitable; ~2.7 to 20% stroke survivors with PSCI but no dementia may eventually recover, depending on age and provided there is no recurrent stroke.
Studies that combined sophisticated imaging techniques with extensive neuropsychological tests have produced the most reliable information, although these are few and far between. One excellent, and very interesting, example is a 2018 paper on a prospective, hospital-based study used 3-T MRI and a comprehensive standardized battery of neuropsychological tests 6 months after the index event to define the neuroimaging determinants of poststroke cognitive performance and their relative contributions. Data were available for 356 patients, 326 [91.6%] of whom had experienced an ischemic stroke.
Half of the patients were found to have cognitive impairment six months poststroke.
Of the many different MRI markers, the presence of a lesion within a small ""strategic"" site (i.e., the right corticospinal tract, left antero-middle thalamus, left arcuate fasciculus, left middle frontal gyrus, or left postero-inferior cerebellum) was the main determinant of poststroke cognitive performance and accounted for 22.5% of the observed variance in the global cognitive score.
Stroke volume, total medial temporal lobe atrophy, and brain tissue volume were independent but weaker determinants, together accounting for an additional 11.8% variance in the global cognitive score.
The total stroke volume accounted for only a small proportion (4.3%) of the variability in cognitive performance.
The white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden, presence of microbleeds, and dilated perivascular spaces were not independent determinants.
This study emphasizes the fact that, regardless of their volume, lesions in strategic areas have a key role in the occurrence of poststroke neurocognitive disorders. Strategic strokes accounted for poor cognitive performance in patients with both a small stroke volume and no cerebral atrophy. Routine assessment of important cognitive domains is an essential part of the clinical workup. When clinical exam and neuroimaging show that there is involvement of strategic locations of the brain, assessment of the function for major brain networks should also be made. These include the domains for language, attention and spatial orientation, object recognition, memory, and motor planning and control.
Also, atrophy has been one of the most controversial MRI markers for poststroke cognitive performance. Data from this 2018 study indicate that cerebral atrophy is associated with cognitive impairments. The researchers hypothesize that post-ischemia neurodegeneration in the subcortical region is probably one of the main contributors. Their results also emphasize the role of medial temporal lobe atrophy in poststroke neurocognitive disorders, independently from a potentially associated Alzheimer's disease. Medial temporal lobe atrophy may be related to delayed ischemic injury in hippocampal areas associated with selective vulnerability in a pure vascular process.
Unfortunately, the cross-sectional design of this 2018 study made it impossible to investigate the relationship between MRI markers and long-term cognitive performance.
The increasing use of MRI is influencing, and may even exaggerate, the estimate of the vascular burden behind cognitive impairment, because vascular changes are more apparent than degenerative ones in neuroradiology. On the other hand, depending on their location, vascular lesions may be more influential than they appear to be, disrupting interconnections between several distal regions. This applies, for example, to lesions in the basal ganglia and to the deep white matter, which damage the frontal-subcortical network and associate with executive dysfunction. The thalamus is another example of a strategic infarct location that may also cause amnestic dysfunction, in addition to executive defects.
(3) What sorts of behavioral changes can be caused by poststroke cognitive impairment?
I tripped across an interesting paper, Stroke and Behavior by Victor W Mark, describing the more common, and some of the more unusual, behavioral changes that stroke can cause. It's intended for the clinician, but it occurred to me that the answer I've written above might just be gibberish to the layman who's never encountered what stroke can do, other than the obvious physical difficulties, such as a paralyzed arm ... and that you might be asking your question because you wonder whether the changes you're observing in your loved one were actually caused by stroke, or something else. I'll briefly summarized what the paper had to say, but if you want to learn more, I'd suggest you contact Dr Mark to ask for a copy of the full publication: Stroke
and Behavior | Request PDF
Doctors and researchers primarily assess the impact of stroke in the controlled environment of the clinic or laboratory, using tests and materials that are assumed to simulate daily living activities, but that actually fail to represent the demands of the ""real world"" on the stroke survivor. Notably, performance is generally evaluated in response to the doctor’s prompting (“on command”), whereas much of real life occurs spontaneously, without prompting, and in a much more familiar environment. These differences can lead to marked differences in behavior between laboratory and home settings that you'll rarely find discussed in the research literature.
Also note that behavioral studies of stroke primarily assess its acute effects, i.e., changes that take place shortly after the stroke. However, the severity as well as the quality of the behavioral effects of stroke may change considerably over the long run.
In some languages -- for example, Chinese -- tone production during speech is crucial for interpreting individual word meanings in those languages. In addition, stroke survivors who had received less formal education are believed to develop more severe symptoms in many cognitive domains. The paper warns that many researchers have studied adults from industrialized societies who were formally well-educated and whose native language was nontonal (i.e., a language in which a word’s meaning is not affected by its intonation). The behavioral changes after stroke among patients who fall outside of these characteristics -- for example, patients from rural China -- are less well understood. On top of that, stroke survivors with severely impaired speech are usually excluded from studies on the impact of stroke on behavior, even those that involve nonverbal cognition tests. Hence, there is also little understanding of the impact of stroke on nonverbal communication in stroke patients.
The following are some of the types of cognitive symptoms that can be caused by stroke. The paper also sometimes provides information on how such symptoms are diagnosed in stroke survivors, and some limited information on rehabilitation.
Executive functions: Dr Mark says, ""This very broad category refers to processes that regulate other functions, in the same way that a company’s executive controls subsidiary operations (eg, marketing, hiring, promotion, production, support services) without directly being involved with them."" Generally speaking, executive functions involve planning (which requires abstraction), initiation, staying mindful of task objectives (working memory), prioritizing goals, sequencing activities for specific goals, and inhibiting attention to irrelevant stimuli (minimizing distraction).
Disturbances to executive function after stroke can cause lack of spontaneity, distractibility, performing multistep operations in the wrong order, failure to inhibit behaviors that are inappropriate to a situation (eg, laughing while attending a funeral), or performing actions repeatedly for a goal or in response to stimulation, but needlessly (""perseveration""). In “recurrent perseveration”, a subtype of perseveration that is common in aphasia, patients uncritically repeat a response that they had provided to a previous question, but now, when given a new question, is inappropriate.
The presence of executive dysfunction after a stroke is thought to predict limited functional recovery, and to interfere with the patient's ability to respond to rehabilitation efforts. Apparently, executive dysfunction after acute stroke is very common, with figures as high as 50% to 75% having been reported. However, it is very difficult to assess executive dysfunction, because the tests often involve lengthy, laborious procedures and/or require patients to understand complex instructions or give spoken responses. The requirements for understanding and responding to complex instructions often end up with a large number of aphasic patients being excluded from executive function studies.
Language: Aphasia, which is one of the most common cognitive disturbances caused by stroke, is difficulty in communicating using language. Language is the ability to encode ideas into words or symbols for communication to someone else, and includes speaking, understanding the speech of others, reading, writing, gesturing (including sign language), and using numbers. Aphasia must be distinguished from speech dysarthria, mutism, aphonia (inability to vocalize), and hearing loss, which affect the physical ability to produce or hear speech, but do not selectively affect the symbolic aspects of speech. For example, stroke survivors with dysarthria experience “slurred” or “mumbled” speech due to limited lip, tongue and jaw movement; and there may be changes in pitch, or vocal quality (e.g., hoarseness or breathiness.)
Aphasia occurs in about one-third of acute stroke patients and predicts worse survival than in nonaphasic stroke patients. By six months after stroke onset, aphasia may improve in more than one-half of patients and completely resolve in about 38%.
Aphasia primarily results from left hemisphere injury (whether the patient is left- or right-handed.) However, aphasic disorders may rarely be caused by right hemisphere stroke, which is called crossed aphasia. The impairments that follow right hemisphere stroke are often subtle and difficult to recognize, including the patient having impaired interpretation of the social signals in discourse (such as failing to notice when another individual wants to end discussion), misunderstanding ambiguity, and producing meandering topics during speech expression.
While aphasia often becomes less severe, the character of the aphasic disturbance may itself change during the patient's recovery. For example, global aphasia (typified by markedly impoverished speech comprehension and production) may change to Wernicke aphasia (fluent but nonsensical speech and poor comprehension); Broca aphasia (good comprehension, poor speech production) may resolve to anomic aphasia (good comprehension and fluency, but with word-finding difficulties). While nonfluent aphasia often gives way to fluent aphasia, fluent aphasia does not change to nonfluent aphasia.
Stroke may also affect the use and/or interpretation of speech intonation, called aprosodia. ""Affective aprosodia"" is the disturbed interpretation or expression of emotional tone in speech; and ""linguistic aprosodia"" is the disturbance of nonemotional tone, for example, the conveyance of emphasis (“!”) or interrogation (“?”) in a sentence. In such disorders, the problem is not with word selection or sentence construction, but rather with determining the speaker’s social perspective (Is he angry?) or need for information (Is she asking a question?). Aprosodia is not associated with damage to any particular brain area or side. Testing is complicated by the need to rely on contrived situations that may not represent ordinary conditions for communications.
Apraxia of speech can also be caused by stroke. This disturbance involves the inconsistent production of speech sounds (particularly consonants, depending on whether they are initial vs later in a word), and is considered a deficit of planning speech movements. This inconsistency thus differs from speech dysarthria. Associated difficulties include slowed rate of speech and abnormal rhythm and intonation. The disorder often is found with concurrent nonfluent aphasia. Reliable diagnosis and treatment have not been well-developed; its incidence in stroke is undetermined.
Attention: Attention is the process of enhancing detection of a signal or stimulus from the environment, to the point where it can then be acted upon. Inattention caused by stroke may either be lateralized or nonlateralized with respect to the environment.
The lateralized deficit is termed ""unilateral spatial neglect"" (neglect for short) and is a topic of intense research. This interest may be in part because the disorder, like aphasia, is easily noticed. For example, the patient with acute severe neglect consistently gazes toward the side of hemispheric damage (Vulpian sign), in the absence of oculomotor palsy. When patients with acute neglect combined with hemiplegia (total or partial paralysis of one side of the body) are asked to clap their hands, often they wave only the relatively good hand toward the body midline repeatedly without accommodating the lack of mobility in the other hand. This ""one-handed clapping"" is known as the Eastchester clapping sign. There is a general decrease in the initiation of action, and in exploring toward the contralateral side of space. Such problems can hamper locomotion (including car or wheelchair navigation), eating, grooming, reading, and protecting the paralyzed limbs from injury during transfers between bed and chair. Unilateral spatial neglect may even occur in one’s imagination, for example, when describing a familiar space that is out of view. Patients are often unaware of their attentional deficit and/or associated unilateral limb paralysis.
Neglect is almost invariably opposite the side of hemispheric injury rather than on the same side of injury. It is about equally common after left versus right hemisphere damage, but right unilateral neglect is typically milder and resolves more rapidly.
Neglect initially occurs in about one-half of all stroke survivors, but its incidence quickly diminishes, so that by about three months after the stroke, only ~30% of survivors still have neglect. However, standard neglect assessments may underestimate its prevalence. For example, standard pen-and-paper assessments may not detect neglect, whereas requesting the patient to perform everyday activities such as self-grooming or finding one’s way in a wheelchair may produce evidence of neglect.
Patients with neglect are also susceptible to nonlateralized deficits of attention, including difficulty sustaining attention (or vigilance) over several minutes, and slowed response times. The finding that acute neglect may be a biomarker for chronic disability or impaired nonlateralized visuospatial processing, even in the absence of demonstrable neglect suggests that it may not be neglect per se that is most disabling, but rather an associated general inattention disorder. Unfortunately, there has been little investigation into nonspatial attentional deficits, their effect on daily living activities, epidemiology, and natural history, let alone controlled trials of rehabilitation.
Memory: When referring to memory here, we are not including the “working memory” that was indicated to be an executive function (i.e., remaining constantly mindful of a fact or task requirement), but rather the process of either learning information or reconstituting it whenever necessary without staying mindful of it (episodic memory). Routine screening tests such as the MMSE ask the patient to repeat 3 unrelated words (e.g., apple, penny, table) immediately, to ensure the patient heard and understood the words, and then to recall those words after a few minutes’ delay (typically 5 minutes) as a brief clinical assessment of memory. Most Alzheimer's patients are unable to recall the words, even in the earliest stages of the disease. Impaired memory may occur in only ~11% of acute stroke patients -- and yet, until very recently, stroke survivors were not considered to have dementia unless they had impaired memory. This requirement was based on the hallmark symptom of Alzheimer's disease, not on any understanding of the severity of the impact stroke can have on the human brain. Moreover, to this day, the vast majority of the research literature on the prevalence and severity of cognitive dysfunction caused by stroke relies on brief screening tools such as the MMSE. Note, too, that unlike most cognitive disorders, verbal memory may continually worsen over the years after a stroke, relative to healthy individuals of the same age.
Emotion: Stroke can provoke a wide variety of emotional changes which tend to follow a sequence rather than occurring all at once.
Initial changes may include the “catastrophic reaction” and pseudobulbar affect. Catastrophic reaction refers to short-term marked irritability, anger, anxiety, or sadness when prompted to perform a task within the first few days of stroke onset. For example, patients with acute fluent aphasia with poor speech comprehension (Wernicke aphasia) may display marked agitation. After recovery from the aphasia, patients have reported that they had felt terrified, yet they believed that they could comprehend speech ordinarily, despite clinical observations to the contrary. Pseudobulbar affect is disinhibited crying or laughter that does not match the patient’s mood. The condition has a large number of synonyms, including emotionalism, emotional incontinence, pathologic affect, pathologic laughter and crying, and pseudobulbar palsy. Pseudobulbar affect has not been studied comprehensively. Its prevalence after stroke has been reported to range from 18% to 58%. The condition can be readily misdiagnosed as depression, with which it may co-occur. Stress can aggravate the pathologic display of affect.
True depression emerges a few weeks after stroke onset. In stroke survivors, depression comprises a combination of sad mood, lack of initiative, steady state rather than cyclic emotional changes, lowered self-esteem, and feelings of guilt, particularly after patients have interacted with the complex world outside of the intensive care unit. depression is exceedingly common, ranging from 40% to 60% of patients, depending on the sample. The relationship between stroke and depression is bidirectional: depression itself is a risk factor for subsequent stroke, including fatal stroke, for unclear reasons. depression carries with it an increased risk of suicidal ideation, particularly in the first 2 years. Depression is also a biomarker for general cognitive impairment147,148 and impaired activities of daily living. Fortunately, conventional antidepressant medications are efficacious for poststroke depression. Improvement in depression is associated with improved self-care skills.
Poststroke fatigue, which can co-occur with other poststroke conditions such as depression, also develops relatively late after stroke onset. In stroke survivors, ""fatigue"" refers to declining cognitive ability that is associated with the feeling of physical or mental strain, which can disrupt even simple routine activities. Poststroke fatigue may be found in the absence of pronounced neurologic deficits and is associated with failure to return to employment. It tends to be a chronic disorder. It has a reported prevalence ranging from 23% to 75%.
Informal observations noted that the attitude of the stroke survivor toward the paralyzed arm may be affected. For example, patients with right hemiplegia and global (or severe) aphasia may reach over with the left hand and repeatedly mobilize the limp arm in the first few hours after stroke onset. In contrast, patients with left hemiplegia after stroke are more apt to demonstrate marked hatred for the arm, a condition that is called misoplegia.
Apathy refers to the combination of lack of goal-directed behaviors and diminished interest and concern. The incidence of poststroke apathy is 20% to 25%. The condition does not occur invariably with depression, but it does place patients at high risk for depression and suicidal ideation. Apathy has not been investigated very thoroughly in stroke patients.
Diminished empathy may also follow stroke. Empathy refers to the ability to adopt the perspective of another individual with concern for that person’s goals. The study of empathy is a newly emerging focus in poststroke behavioral changes. According to a recent study, about one-half of the caregivers of patients recovering from right hemisphere stroke regarded the patients’ loss of empathy as one of their greatest stressors. As discussed under ""language"" above, right hemisphere stroke can make it difficult for a stroke survivor to understand sarcasm, which is one aspect of reduced empathy.
Movement: The behavioral regulation of movement, particularly limb movement, can be significantly affected by stroke. As noted above, patients may exhibit unilateral motor neglect; however, another cause is learned nonuse. The difference between the two is that the former is considered to be based on a form of inattention, whereas the latter is thought to emerge from the combination of the inability of the partially paralyzed limb to perform routine self-care activities and the simultaneous compensation for such activities by the opposite, better functioning arm. Thus, learned nonuse is behaviorally conditioned by the circumstances of chronic hemiparesis (slight paralysis or weakness on one side of the body), leading to the persisting inhibition of spontaneous limb use for everyday activities.
Motor neglect and learned nonuse of hemiparesis can both be improved with verbal prompting. However, the inverse relationship can also occur, i.e., movement can be inhibited after prompting. The difference depends on the extent of attention paid by the patient. For example, in the Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome (aka anterior opercular syndrome), stroke survivors may be unable to perform movements of the mouth upon command, yet show normal movements in a more familiar context (which demands less attention), such as when presented food or in response to an emotional stimulus. A limb version of such automatic-voluntary dissociation has been proposed, termed exo-evoked akinesia, but has seldom been reported clinically. Functional movement disorder (aka conversion disorder or psychogenic neurologic disorder) is a different kind of exo-evoked akinesia that manifests as a movement failure when the patient attends to the affected limb or is commanded to move it, but improves with distraction.
Ideomotor apraxia (or apraxia for short) is the failure to competently generate the movements that are specific to tool use or gestures, despite (a) having sufficient movement capability to perform nonspecific movements and (b) understanding the task requirements. The term is applied when the stroke survivor is unable to recreate movements specific to learned activities, rather than reflecting part of a more general memory disorder. Ideomotor apraxia is most often reported with respect to upper extremity function, less so for oral movements (eg, soda straw use or blowing out a match), and even less for leg use (eg, kicking a ball, stamping out a cigarette). Roughly 6-7% of stroke survivors exhibit apraxia. Apraxia is important to stroke care because it is a biomarker for impaired functional recovery.
Alien hand syndrome is a mostly unilateral disorder that involves seemingly purposeful activities by one hand without the patient’s consciously intending them, as if an alternate personality were guiding them. Although various subtypes have been described, the two most often reported are frontal alien hand and callosal alien hand, named for the brain regions that are characteristically affected. Frontal alien hand involves the disinhibited grabbing of objects that are within reaching distance. Often it is then hard for the patient to release the object. Callosal alien hand involves one hand obstructing, repeating, or undoing the actions of the other hand that is under voluntary control. For example, a callosal alien hand may counteract blouse unbuttoning by the other hand. Alien hand in either form may be frustrating, humiliating, or even dangerous, such as when grasping a hot object or driving a car. Despite numerous case reports, the epidemiology of alien hand has rarely been studied because it is rare, accounting for less than 1% of stroke patients in one series.
Sensory processing: Agnosias, in which a given sensory system is functioning normally but the brain misinterprets the signals from the system, are not unusual after stroke, but are not studied as much as the disorders described above, for several reasons. For example, because these disorders mostly arise from damage to posterior parts of the cerebrum, they often occur little or no effect on motor control and therefore are less likely to warrant inpatient rehabilitation. In addition, it is not unusual for patients with these disturbances to be unaware of these problems (the condition of anosognosia). [Speaking from my experience with agnosias in Alzheimer's patients, the caregiver is typically unaware of the problems, as well, and cannot begin to understand why the patient is behaving in a given way. In Alzheimer's, agnosias come and go, which further confuses efforts to figure out what is going on.]
Visual agnosias may be chronic in 20% of stroke survivors. Those with loss of visual awareness -- at least for stationary objects -- to one side may initially be unaware of this loss. If they lack pronounced cognitive disorders, they can often readily discover their visual field limitation through interacting with the environment or through clinical education, and may learn to compensate for visual loss by increasing their head or eye movements to one side. However, a large percentage exhibit highly disorganized visual exploration, even in their preserved visual field for unclear reasons, and are vulnerable to accidents at busy traffic intersections or in other cluttered environments. Simple coaching and practice or formal oculomotor training may help to minimize this problem.
A rare poststroke symptom of visual agnosia is the inability to recognize objects despite being capable of making elementary judgments about their properties, e.g., size and shape. Similarly, patients with auditory agnosia can point to sounds and describe some of their properties (eg, “clicking” when listening to a thumb moving along a pocket comb) without being able to specify the object responsible. A similar disturbance attends the rarely reported instance of tactile agnosia.
A peculiar but little studied disorder involves the difficulty that stroke patients may have with connecting familiar percepts or concepts to each other. In particular, stroke survivors, particularly those with aphasia, were unable to color in line drawings of familiar objects with the expected colors (eg, banana / yellow). Instead, they significantly often chose unexpected colors, even though color blindness was excluded. This, accordingly, is termed color association disorder. A right hemisphere stroke patient without aphasia, however, used just a couple of colors in a line drawing of multiple familiar objects in a single plausible outdoor scene.
Although such a disorder would seem to have little clinical relevance, the researchers noted that aphasic patients may also be prone to other abnormalities of percept matching, namely inability to match sounds that they heard to the most likely object in a picture array (eg, meow / cat). They also could not properly simulate object use when they were shown objects (eg, swing the arm when shown a hammer). The latter is a standard assessment of apraxia. The real-life implications of such difficulties when measured under laboratory conditions is not yet clear, but suggest a fundamental difficulty with abstraction.
Hallucinations, although rare, can also follow stroke. Typically, the hallucinations are of the visual kind, i.e., seeing something that isn't there. The stroke patient may see simple geometric shapes or complex objects, or have uncontrollable reexperiencing of objects that had just been viewed (palinopsia, or visual perseveration).
Still other visual disturbances for which the clinician should be aware include alexia (the inability to interpret writing or print despite being able to see it), achromatopsia (loss of color vision from brain injury), and prosopagnosia (difficulty recognizing familiar faces). The auditory analog of prosopagnosia -- i.e., the impaired ability to recognize familiar voices -- is termed phonagnosia and has been reported in stroke, but rarely studied.

This large and detailed cross-sectional study used a comprehensive, standardized neuropsychological battery to explore all cognitive domains; and assessed cognitive performance after adjusting for demographic factors to eliminate confusion between demographic factors and MRI determinants. It was not restricted to dementia or to the presence of cognitive impairment but rather analyzed the cognitive score as a continuous variable; this reflects cognitive performance more accurately and is not affected by discretization errors.

95d53902,Are strokes related to ischemic heart disease?,"Strokes are mostly due to atherosclerosis. Coronary heart disease is due mostly to the same thing. Atherosclerosis is a disease that is multifocal ( touches many arteries at the same time) and can touch any artery in the body.
Now to be succinct, there are other causes for these ischemic accidents besides atherosclerosis e.g. hereditary clotting problem, vasculitis…etc. But the principle stays the same, if it can affect a coronary artery or block it, it can affect too a cerebral artery.
When plaque builds up, the artery’s wall becomes fragile. Now you need to know the the inner layer of a vessel, called endothelium, does not trigger a thrombus formation. The rupture of a plaque exposes the external layers of the wall of an artery to blood, clotting happens, as there is many chemicals that triggers it ( the same happens when you get a wound) and closes the artery further. All colors of the spectrum can be observed, from a completely and acutely blocked artery giving rise to an acute coronary syndrome to a relatively tolerated partial block to an extent, patient is happy when resting and in pain when making effort described as a stable angina.
To conclude, yes!! Strokes and ischemic heart disease are related to the extent that they are a manifestation of the same disease affecting arteries essentially, which is frequently atherosclerosis."
81b3f8be,Will people who have trans ischemic attacks (TIA) always end up having a stroke?,"No. With proper treatment, one can definitely reduce the risk of a stroke and this is often very successful.
Patients with TIA, left untreated, are at very high risk of having a complete stroke within the foreseeable future, but proper treatment for risk factors can reduce this considerably. This involves tight control of blood pressure, antiplatelet agents, control of blood sugar and control of cholesterol, among other things. Those with cardiological or vascular abnormalities need these treated as well."
537e7719,"Can ""silent strokes"" only be of the ischemic type of stroke (thrombus), or also hemorrhagic (cracked blood vessel)?","By nature hemorrhagic strokes are silent. Most people who would have them? If they goto bed due to the headache it produces, are dead by morning.
There are small hemorrhagic strokes that a patient lives, but outcomes for hemorrhagic strokes are dimmer. Not only because of blood loss, but blood contacting brain tissue is extremely toxic. It causes an inflammation process that the body tries to separate itself from the brain, and all that was bypassed. They have poorer outcomes because how much that inflammation kills itself.
Ischemic strokes the person usually survives to show/tell they even had a “silent stroke”.
The term used for “silent strokes” for ischemic strokes is often called Lacunar strokes, that often occur in the middle brain areas (thalamic strokes, for example). They can be many too (i.e., multiform) in a person. They’re “silent” because people mistake them for having a bad headache; or their eyes are tired; because of both they’re walking like a drunk. Usually hemorrhagic strokes will have much more devastating signs, caused by blood “on the brain” itself."
a5b5949f,"What's the difference between a mini stroke, a transient ischemic attack (TIA), and a headrush that leads to syncope (fainting)?","A mini stroke and a TIA are essentially the same. You feel some numbness/weakness in half of your body, potentially have dizzy spells, lose some ability possibly like speech, etc but things resolve relatively quickly, say within 24 hours or maybe a few days. Have a work colleague who had a minor stroke one night, everything was back to ""normal"" the next morning.
A typical stroke on the other hand ranging from (big to major to massive, etc) depending on the damage, can lead to hemiplegia (half-body paralysis), aphasia (loss of speech) or other life-changing injuries that can take months to resolve. I had my major stroke 7 months ago, and i'm still recovering, and rehabilitating, and still learning to walk ""normal"" again.
Sorry, can't really speak about headrushes that lead to fainting.. But re your episodes, I really think you should visit the hospital, if in case you had a ministroke, your chances of having a real stroke is really big, and boy, you'd want to avoid that in way possible. I believe from what I was told, an MRI or CT scan would reveal past strokes, even mini ones... i hope you have yourself checked."
18794170,Is hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy a stroke?,Wonder why Dr Stout said No. if the definition of ‘strike’ is used HI encephalopathy in newborn is also stroke
dcca82e3,"If they say that there is no blood flowing throughout the brain, then how about a stroke or a TIA (transient ischemic attack)?","I’m not sure what you are asking with this question, but I will try to answer, based on what I assume you are getting at.
The condition of “no blood flowing throughout the brain” is what one would see in the case of cardiac arrest, where the heart stops pumping. That would cause severe brain damage within a few minutes, if blood flow were not restored. The brain depends on the circulation for a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen.
In the case of stroke or TIA, blood flow is reduced, but only to a part of the brain, not the brain as a whole. It need not necessarily be reduced to zero to cause symptoms.
Normally, cerebral blood flow is maintained at ~50 mL per 100 g of brain tissue per minute. A fall to 30 ml/100g/min would very likely cause symptoms.
The body puts a premium on maintaining a constant blood flow to the brain via the process called autoregulation. If you are interested in learning more about this, here is a link to get you started.

3cbd3874,What are the other types of strokes except for Ischemic and Hemorrhagic stroke?,"No, it is insufficient information about stroke. It describes generally what happens in an acute stroke, but not the things one can do to prevent stroke — and to prevent a second stroke if you’re fortunate enough to survive an initial stroke.
The biggest risk factor for stroke is having had a prior stroke. I learned that from the EMT’S who were transporting me from the Neuro ICU to the acute care rehabilitation hospital after I had a hemorrhagic stroke. I was shocked!
My neurologist found a second, unburst aneurysm in my internal carotid artery. He said that my initial brain hemorrhage may have saved my life because it caused the second, extremely dangerous aneurysm to be found. He “coiled” the aneurysm in an intracerebral endovascular procedure. I was kept overnight in the neuro ICU afterward, then released without a ticking time bomb in my brain!
If you’re worried about stroke:
Quit smoking everything if you smoke anything.
Quit drinking. Even one small alcoholic drink per day increases your risk of stroke.
Monitor your blood pressure at home, and if it is consistently over 120/80, take your BP readings to your doctor to discuss them.
Eat according to the DASH Diet.[1] Clinical studies have shown it to reduce overall blood pressure.
Take BP medications if your doctor prescribes them.
I wish I’d known I had high BP prior to my stroke. I felt fine. I was working hard and didn’t prioritize my doctor’s annual visit. I hadn’t even been to the doctor for more than two years when I had the stroke. My neurologist thinks that high blood pressure is what caused the bleed in my brain that left me disabled enough to be approved for Social Security Disability to approve my application within months of my initial application, without rejecting it or even asking many questions beyond a review of my medical records.
I am fortunate to have survived, but I will live with disabling deficits for the rest of my life.

f5a3594b,Does evidence of cortical lacuna infarct and chronic small vessel ischemic changes definitely describe a stroke or could it be just a migraine?,"""Infarct"" refers to a portion of tissue that has died due to insufficient blood supply. ""Ischemic changes"" are a reduction in blood supply; since the changes are described as ""chronic"" rather than ""acute"", it means they are lasting rather than temporary.
In other words, this is not just a migraine because there is evidence that actual damage has occurred. There is also evidence that blood supply has been reduced, and will stay reduced unless something is done about it."

04cdab08,Is it possible to have brain damage from a “heat stroke” (I realize this is very different from an ischemic or vascular stroke) and not know it? Or would these instances require hospitalization?,"If I read your question correctly, I’d say that if one had brain damage from a heat stroke and didn’t know it, it would be because the damage was so severe that the individual didn’t know much of anything.
If one is searching for an explanation for minor brain-related symptoms, there are multiple diagnostic possibilities that are probably more likely than an unrecognized heat stroke that happened without any of the clinical features of hyperthermia."

Benzodiazepine medication is highly addictive. If the person had been taking fenoldopam prior to the stroke, acute withdrawal would be considered by the treating doctors.
During my hemorrhagic stroke, I was given an anti-seizure medication to prevent seizure due to the stroke. I had lots of tests, then they transferred me to the ICU where they gradually reduced my blood pressure using various drugs. I received magnesium one day. potassium the next (or vice versa).

Do path strokes appear similar to these examples above? If yes you need to look at Stroke dialog box in Illustrator.
Command + function key 10, or with Mouse cursor Window on main menu bar, scroll down to Stroke. This will open or close Stroke dialog box.
Select a path. Examine the stroke dialog box. Be sure the show option is on for the stroke dialog box. (little icon of three lines in right upper corner)
If dashed line is checked, uncheck it and see what happens to the selected path.
The next dialog box to examine is the Appearance, use the menu (little icon of three lines in right upper corner) in this dialog box and scroll to clear appearance. Observe what happens to selected path.
Remember you have to select it to effect it.
If those do not change path “stokes not completely solid” issue. View the path in outline mode, make sure it is a one segment path and not many small path segments.
If none of these suggestions work, maybe another will have answer."

efda1aa5,Does increasing the stroke of the engine change compression?,"Realize that unless you have a “really weird” engine to start with, it’s not possible to change ONLY the stroke length without also having to change other parts. For instance: if you lengthen stroke without also changing either the connecting rod length or the piston compression height (distance from the wrist pin centerline to the top of the piston) - or both, the longer stroke is going to cause the top of the piston to travel higher in the cylinder bore than it did before. Really bad things (as in “crossing the streams bad”) happen when a piston crashes into the bottom of the cylinder head and/or valves, so either you have to move those parts farther away from the piston tops or you have to ‘shorten’ the overall length of the piston/rod assembly. Compression ratio is nothing more than the ratio of the maximum volume (piston at bottom dead center- BDC) to the minimum cylinder volume (piston at top dead center - TDC) including the volume in the combustion chamber, head gasket opening, any valve reliefs in the pistons, etc. A longer stroke makes the maximum volume larger. If you shorten the piston/rod assembly so that it still fits into the cylinder at TDC without crashing into things, then assuming that the minimum volume is still near what it was before (piston height in the bore is the same as before) then viola - more compression because of the ratio. If you solved the interference problem by moving the fixed parts farther away (by using much thicker head gaskets for example) then resultant compression still depends on that ratio of max volume to min volume."
f0b48750,How do I care for my husband who is 57 but a stroke left him functioning at about a 12-year old level.,"Hmmm... I am guessing here that you concern is not so much related to what he thinks about but instead related to his behavior. If not, why would you care if his thoughts are somewhat childish?
So, my recommendation is to confront the behavior you find is improper or irritating in a respectful manner. Don't attack his character. Instead appeal to that part of him that is a man.
Another thought is that his behavior might be, in part, a reaction to your treatment of him. I know that it is not uncommon for a wife to treat her husband as if she were his mother. I think it is somewhat understandable for moms who are in that parenting mode much of the day. But you are not his mom. I'm not saying this is you issue, but if the shoe fits wear it.
I am speaking to you about what you can do, so it may sound like I am taking his side. I'm not - I think it is highly likely that his behavior at times seems childish (mine does, too, at times). But he didn't ask me for advice.
One final thought. I highly recommend a book by Emmerson Eggerichs titled, ""Love and Respect"". You might find it really helpful. It is good at explaining some basic differences about how men and women think and it contains many useful suggestions for how both of you can improve your marriage.
Good luck and may God bless!"

8f5b75d0,What should happen with the White House if the president had a stroke leaving him unable to speak and function?,"This situation would, most likely, result in the implementation of Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution. Per the terms of this section, if both the Vice President and a majority of the members of the president’s cabinet believe that the President of the United States is incapacitated (be it physically, mentally, or any other situation that they believe renders the president unable to do his or her job), they must notify the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate that the president is incapacitated. As soon as they do that, the president is relieved of duty (but not removed from office) and the vice president becomes Acting President of the United States.
Once the disability (whatever it is) no longer exists (let’s assume the president goes through rehab as well as physical and occupational therapy to the point that he or she feels ready to go back to work), the president would then notify the Speaker and President pro tempore of his or her intention to resume the powers and duties of the presidency. Should the vp and cabinet not agree with the president that he or she is now functional, they would so notify the Speaker and President pro tempore within four days of the president’s declaration of fitness, at which time Congress would have to decide the situation. If both houses of Congress vote by a 2/3 majority that the president is still incapacitated, the VP remains Acting President.
This type of scenario has never been implemented since it was written into the US Constitution in 1967. Many scholars and historians (myself included) are of the conclusion that it should have been used in March, 1981 after Ronald Reagan was shot. However, Vice President George HW Bush was out of Washington at the time, and by the time he returned to DC, Reagan was already out of surgery with a strong prognosis, so Bush decided not to ask the cabinet to invoke this procedure.
As a piece of added info, Section 3 of the same amendment provides for a president voluntarily surrendering power to the VP by using the same notification procedure, if he or she knows a disability exists or is going to exist. This part has been used three times—once by Reagan in 1985 when he was having surgery, and twice by George W Bush (in 2002 and 2007, I think) when he was undergoing routine medical testing that required sedation for an hour or so."

So it also means water is getting into the combustion chamber which is making the exhaust gases turn white.

Race relations have been influenced by bad college theories that under most recent (and worst) iteration came about in the late 90s to early 2000s. These theories were fed to society heavily by about 2010. I explain them in the below. I’ve been fighting these theories for 20 years.
Rudolph Jensen's answer to What is wrong with saying ‘all lives matter’?
These theories linked below this paragraph are sexist and racist. They are leading to massive problems when applied to society that we are seeing right now. Of course, the “woke” crowd doesn’t see it that way. The theories divide people into groups based on race, sex, sexual orientation, and gender then perpetually treat those groups differently. Some are grouped into perpetual oppressors and others perpetual victims. Racism is discriminating against different races based on color of skin. Racism is dynamic and not fixed to a simplistic narrative. Academia has a LOT of power and they teach these theories to others. Those people once taught go into journalism, teaching, activist groups, and politics. Virtue signaling and getting special victim status is intoxicating as it’s a “feel good” narrative and gives power to those pushing the narrative. This type of victimology lead to authoritarianism and hundreds of millions of deaths in the 20th century through Communism and Fascism. You’d think humans would learn but alas they often don’t want to think critically. The number one problem and threat in the Western World now is adherence to these theories.

“Virtually no idea is too ridiculous to be accepted, even by very intelligent and highly educated people, if it provides a way for them to feel special and important. Some confuse that feeling with idealism.”
― Thomas Sowell
“Some of the biggest cases of mistaken identity are among intellectuals who have trouble remembering that they are not God.”
― Thomas Sowell
“Intellectuals may like to think of themselves as people who ""speak truth to power"" but too often they are people who speak lies to gain power.”
― Thomas Sowell
“It is amazing how many people think that they can answer an argument by attributing bad motives to those who disagree with them. Using this kind of reasoning, you can believe or not believe anything about anything, without having to bother to deal with facts or logic.”
― Thomas Sowell
“One of the painful signs of years of dumbed-down education is how many people are unable to make a coherent argument. They can vent their emotions, question other people's motives, make bold assertions, repeat slogans-- anything except reason.”
― Thomas Sowell
“What socialism
, fascism and other ideologies of the left have in common is an assumption that some very wise people—like themselves—need to take decisions out of the hands of lesser people, like the rest of us, and impose those decisions by government fiat.”

Relative efficiency of pigment and horny layer thickness in protecting the skin of Europeans and Africans against solar ultraviolet radiation
*
M. L. Thomson
Basically this study found that dark skin people are not only darker, but their skin is hotter, however melanin disperses the heat, which also prevents burns. Dark skin (in this case SubSaharan Africans) can absorb nearly 36% more solar radiation than indigenous Europeans (on average)…obviously all African and all Europeans are not of the same skin color. This absorption of greater heat, they found to increase the quickness at which Africans began to sweat compared to Europeans, which helped cool them faster.
Back in the 1950’s some people thought black people just had “thicker skin” and therefore this gave them more immunity to sunlight than Europeans. However , that was found not to matter. It was melanin. Melanin disperses solar radiation, stopping it from damaging the skin tissues, this is found to more than compensate for the fact it actually absorbs more solar radiation.
This is actually counter intuitive…I suppose. White people burn although their skin is more reflective. Black people have far less reflective skin, but the thing that makes the skin less reflective is also what protects it from solar radiation…amazing!"

One must understand blood pressure in simplest form for which doctors have no time to explain. ""Pressure on arterial walls is blood pressure "" why it increases?Following could be attributed to high blood pressure
1. Cholesterol gets deposited on arterial walls,causing narrowing of arteries and reducing available space for blood flow thereby increasing pressure on arterial walls.
2. Hardening of arteries. Cholesterol deposition and ageing process causes hardening of arteries,known as atherosclerosis.Arteries loose it's natural elasticity resulting in high BP.
3. Water retention. It's caused by some medical conditions like kidney problems etc.,commonest cause of water retention is access salt and alcohol intake. In both the conditions blood volume increases which in turn raises blood pressure.
4. Constriction of arteries. It's caused mainly due to stress,smoking or intake of nicotine. When arteries are constricted blood pressure increases.
When one takes medicine it gives relief of symptoms by relaxing arteries or by reducing heart rate or its force but does not eliminate underlying causes discussed above and one gets feeling of cured and continues with unchanged life style, harbouring disease in perpetuity."
2044ba39,Does exercise increase blood pressure?,"During Exercise (short term effect)
The blood pressure is expressed as
Systolic (SBP) the upper level - it corresponds with the pumping forward pressure of the heart.
Diastolic (DBP), the lower pressure that corresponds with the peripheral resistance (of the arteries).
The difference between systolic and diastolic is pulse pressure (PP).
The mean pressure (MBP) is Diastolic pressure + Pulse Pressure /3
If BP is 120/80; SBP 120, DBP 80; PP 120-80 = 40; Mean pressure 80 + 40/3 = 93
There are two types of exercise
Isometric (Exercise where muscle gets tensed, but does not move)
eg Pushups, benchpress.
Isometric exercise increases SBP, DBP and MBP - So not ideal for heart.
Isotonic Exercise (Exercise that moves but muscle tension doesn't increase much)
eg - walking, jogging, swimming etc.
Isotonic exercise increases SBP, Lowers DBP and MBP remain same or slightly reduce.
If my BP is 120/80 and I come back after a jog, the typical BOP would be 160/60 because of dilation and expansion of peripheral vessels.
Long term regular isotonic exercise reduce BP by making peripheral vessels supple and dilated.
The benefit of isometric exercise in reducing BP is more on calming the mind rather than improving hemodynamics of the circulation.

2- Eat less.
As Jean Flores, Up to a certain point, getting thinner will reduce your blood pressure. Bigger mass = bigger body to pump things through = higher blood pressure.
3- Lower your stress level:
As Jean Flores, stress is a result of the never-ending daily chores so, it's so important that you get some time off and reduce your stress. MeditationSecretsAZ is a good site to learn medation and eiminate your stress.
4- Walk and exercise regularly:
As Jean Flores, it's a good idea to exercise for at least 20 minutes in the morning on a regular basis then this can bring the reading down by up to 9 mmHg.
5- Taichi
As Jean Flores, taichi also is one of the best way to lower your high blood pressure. TaichiA2Z is the best site to learn Yang taichi or Wudang tai chi.
6- Change your life style:

239f4d0f,"Why is 120/80 considered normal blood pressure? What's the logic behind 120 and 80? Is that value normal at any age, or does ""normal"" change?","The premise of this question is wrong.
120/80 is the common cut-off for when you need to start to worry about your blood pressure. Though blood pressures slightly higher than 120/80 are considered normal as well.
Why is the cut off 120/80? That’s the conclusion that experts have agreed upon most recently. (See JNC 8 guidelines
)
Okay. But WHY did those experts agree on those?
Well. Studies that have been done. Starting with the groundbreaking landmark incredible Framingham Heart Study
; lots of studies have been done to try to determine if there were any correlations/causations for high blood pressure and heart disease. And yes, there were. The Framingham study is very notable because it is HUGE, it is a great study design, and the first of its kind (at least in that scale). We knew very little prior to this study.
We now know that there is a correlation between high blood pressure and heart disease. As your blood pressure rises, your risk increases (in terms of seeing how many people got heart disease and at what blood pressure).
But Jason! Why 120/80? Mostly because the incidence of heart disease starts to climb at 120/80. It isn’t high at 120/80, but it is starting to raise. At systolic pressures of 130, the incidence rate becomes steeper and steeper, past 130, it’s already unacceptably higher than normal.
The number 120/80 is mostly arbitrary. Guided merely by the increases in incidence of heart disease from the cohort studies done in the past.
For your next question, Is this the value for any age? No! Not at all. Pediatric patients have their own set of recommended values, and geriatric patients have their own set of recommended values as well. Neonates have their own values as well.
Keep in mind that 120/80 is a normal *resting* blood pressure. You can have a blood pressure at 170/110 and it could still be considered normal if you were doing a lot of running 10 second prior."
09f994e9,Can caffeine increase blood pressure?,"Coffee has a dual effect on blood pressure.
Caffeine (1, 3, 7-trimethylxanthine) in coffee is a central nervous system stimulant, which means it stimulates the brain. It causes the release of the stimulants, noradrenaline and adrenaline, in the brain. It is also an inhibitor at the adenosine receptors. Since blood pressure is dependent on the heart rate and stroke volume, as well as on the peripheral resistance which, in turn, is dependent on vasoconstriction, coffee will raise blood pressure.
Blood Pressure = Heart Rate x Stroke Volume x Total peripheral Resistance,
By all indications, caffeine central nervous effects will raise blood pressure indirectly by increasing all the three components of blood pressure in the equation above.
Caffeine (1, 3, 7-trimethylxanthine) has direct effects on the heart. By increasing the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), caffeine increases the contractility of the heart. It does so by inhibiting phosphodiesterase. The cAMP in the heart is linked to beta-1 receptors which increase contraction. It, thus, increases the stroke volume and the heart rate. Again, as an adenosine blocker, caffeine activates the heart.
Caffeine in coffee, however, in blood vessels, directly causes vasodilation, which leads to increased urination, and this dehydrates the body. The vasodilation is mediated by cAMP, which in the case of blood vessels, is linked to the beta-2 receptor which causes relaxation. Caffeine equally causes blood vessel dilation indirectly by stimulating the release of nitric oxide. The vasodilation and increased urination will reduce blood pressure.
Vasodilation will reduce peripheral resistance, and dehydration will reduce the volume of blood, the venous return, and the stroke volume.
Again, looking at the equation, above, caffeine will directly lower blood pressure by lowering two of the three components of blood pressure, namely the stroke volume, and the peripheral resistance.
My take:
Initially, blood pressure will rise on drinking coffee due to the multiple effects of caffeine on the brain, heart tissue, and blood vessels. This rise, however, is blunted when profound vasodilation and dehydration set in and reduce blood pressure, negating the initial rise.
Drinking just a few cups of coffee a day, in my opinion, will not raise blood pressure. That said, high levels of caffeine, as in energy drinks, can raise blood pressure to a dangerously high level, especially in hypertensive patients."
8a7bee69,Why does sodium increase blood pressure?,"Salt / Sodium Effects On Blood Pressure And Brain to kidney >
Salt works on your kidneys to make your body hold on to more water.
This extra stored water raises your blood pressure and puts strain on your kidneys, arteries, heart and brain.
Kidneys
Arteries
Hear
t
brain
Your body removes unwanted fluid by filtering your blood through your kidneys. Here any extra fluid is sucked out and put into your bladder to be removed as urine.
To do this, your kidneys use osmosis to draw the extra water out of your blood. This process uses a delicate balance of sodium and potassium to pull the water across a wall of cells from the bloodstream into a collecting channel that leads to the bladder.
Eating salt raises the amount of sodium in your bloodstream and wrecks the delicate balance, reducing the ability of your kidneys to remove the water.
The result is a higher blood pressure due to the extra fluid and extra strain on the delicate blood vessels leading to the kidneys.
Over time, this extra strain causes damage the kidneys - known as kidney disease. This reduces their ability to filter out unwanted and toxic waste products, which then start to build up in the body.
If kidney disease is left untreated and the blood pressure isn't lowered, the damage can lead to kidney failure. This is when the kidneys are no longer able to be filter the blood and the body slowly becomes poisoned by its own toxic waste products.
These five condiments top the list of salt traps:
Ketchup & BBQ sauce
We know that there’s a lot of sugar in ketchup – and unlike what Ronald Reagan once said, it doesn’t count as a serving of vegetables! But the salt factor in ketchup is also something to consider. One tablespoon of ketchup – about what you might put on your hotdog at a hockey game from one of those little packets – clocks in at 167 mg of sodium. That’s 7% of the daily recommended dose for an adult. For a child, well it’s not hard to do the math when most dietitians recommend no sodium for kids at all.
Mustard
A serving of mustard, that other street-meat condiment, has around the same amount of sodium as ketchup– 150 mg. And those fancy French Dijon mustards from France don’t change a thing. Most contain about 120 mg.
…just in case you’. It also contains over 100mg per tablespoon.
Hot Sauce
One teaspoon can clock in as high as 120 mg of salt –not as “hot” as one might think. But we must admit, a little goes a long way. If you like it hot, you can always try a couple of shakes of chillies into your cooking instead.
Soy Sauce
Finally, the very condiment that is often used to replace table salt is another super-carrier: Soy sauce. Just one tablespoon has over 900 mg of sodium – that’s almost half your daily intake! Even reduced-sodium soy sauce contains over 500 mg. How about making your own peanut sauce, or squeezing a little lemon on your food?
Salad dressing
Eating a healthy salad? Good job! Now, check the sodium content of what you’ve smothered on top: Italian salad dressing contains 430 milligrams in just 2 tablespoons! You’ll likely use at least that. – Maybe try a little lemon , and herbs , balsamic vinegar instead
Today’s food culture of being able to eat whatever we want, whenever we want has made it difficult for people to limit their intakes, which has led to two-thirds of Americans being overweight. Like an alcoholic or smoker who is trying to quit, advising them to just have one drink or one cigarette a day will do little to eliminate the cravings or the overall habit; it will only leave them frustrated, with that taste still in their mouth, wanting more. Giving up salt, oil and/or sugar can feel the same way for many people, a state that TrueNorth Health Center calls “The Pleasure Trap.
SOS/salt oils/sugar
Nutritionally speaking, we do not need to add salt, oil and sugar to our food; we can get all the sodium, fat and sugar we need, and in their best forms, from eating a whole-food, plant-based diet
. The body’s actual need for sodium and essential fats are in fact pretty low (less than the amount of sodium in ¼ teaspoon of salt a day and less than 10% of daily calories from fat), so we don’t need to supplement with any added salt and oil."
dc7e6431,Which hormone controls blood pressure?,"Blood pressure isn’t controlled by a hormone, but it is influenced by several of them.
The biggest influence on blood pressure is blood volume, and therefore how much water the body retains. Assuming a beating heart, the organs with the next greatest influence are the kidneys. The amount of water they retain in the body, and the ratio of water to sodium, are regulated by antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone.
Estrogens can also promote water retention and elevate blood pressure, experienced by many women around the middle of the menstrual cycle.
Epinephrine and norepinephrine also affect blood pressure by stimulating the heart to beat faster and harder and stimulating the constriction of blood vessels.
Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that raises blood pressure.
Natriuretic peptides promote sodium excretion in the urine, water follows sodium, and thus they lower blood pressure.
Thyroid hormones raises the heart rate and contraction force and can contribute to hypertension in hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).
Erythropoietin can raise blood pressure by elevating red blood cell count; a higher concentration of RBCs promotes retention of water in the circulatory system and thus raises BP. This happens in EPO doping by athletes and can occur when someone native to a low elevation spends an extended time at a high elevation such as the Rockies, Andes, or Alps."

in 9 minutes
2- Reduce your sodium intake.
As Nicole Roberts, Salt intake is high around the world. In large part, this is due to processed and prepared foods. In many studies, salt has been linked to high blood pressure and heart events, like stroke. If you already have high blood pressure, it's worth cutting back your sodium intake to see if it makes a difference. Swap out processed foods with fresh ones and try seasoning with herbs and spices, rather than salt.
3- Drink less alcohol.
As Nicole Roberts, Drinking alcohol can raise blood pressure. In fact, alcohol is linked to 16% of high blood pressure cases around the world.While some research has suggested that low-to-moderate amounts of alcohol may protect the heart, those benefits may be offset by negative effects.
4- Eat more potassium-rich foods.
As Nicole Roberts, As Judy Gomez, Potassium is an important mineral. It helps your body get rid of sodium and ease pressure on your blood vessels. To get a better balance of potassium to sodium in your diet, focus on eating fewer processed foods and more fresh, whole foods.
5- Cut back on caffeine.
As Nicole Roberts, If you've ever downed a cup of coffee before you've had your blood pressure taken, you'll know that caffeine causes an instant boost. If you suspect you're caffeine-sensitive, cut back to see if it lowers your blood pressure.
6- Learn to manage stress.
As Nicole Roberts, Stress is a key driver of high blood pressure. When you're chronically stressed, your body is in a constant fight-or-flight mode. On a physical level, that means a faster heart rate and constricted blood vessels. When you experience stress, you might also be more likely to engage in other behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or eating unhealthy food, that can negatively affect blood pressure. MediationWayAZ is the best site to learn how to stop stress and learn mediation.
7- Lose weight.
As Nicole Roberts, If you're overweight, losing weight can make a big difference for your heart health. According to a 2016 study, losing 5% of your body mass could significantly lower high blood pressure. In previous studies, losing 17 pounds (7.7 kg) was linked to lowering systolic blood pressure by 8.5 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 6.5 mm Hg.
8- Try meditation or deep breathing.
As Nicole Roberts, While these two behaviors could also fall under ""stress reduction techniques,"" meditation and deep breathing deserve specific mention. Both meditation and deep breathing are thought to activate the parasympathetic nervous system. This system is engaged when the body relaxes, slowing the heart rate and lowering blood pressure.
9- Cut added sugar and refined carbs.
As Nicole Roberts, There's a growing body of research showing a link between added sugar and high blood pressure. In the Framingham Women's Health Study, women who drank even one soda per day had higher levels than those who drank less than one soda per day. Another study found that having one less sugar-sweetened beverage per day was linked to lower blood pressure.
10- Eat berries.
As Nicole Roberts, Berries are full of more than just juicy flavor. They're also packed with polyphenols, natural plant compounds that are good for your heart. One small study had middle-aged people eat berries for eight weeks. Participants experienced improvements in different markers of heart health, including blood pressure.

6944a204,How do you know if your blood pressures high?,
51663a15,What foods cause high blood pressure and/or what foods help reduce high blood pressure?,"What is high blood pressure?
Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls. The heart pumps blood into the arteries (blood vessels) which carry the blood throughout the body. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, means the pressure in your arteries is above the normal range. In most cases, no one knows what causes high blood pressure. What you eat can affect your blood pressure.
How does nutrition affect blood pressure?
Certain foods can increase blood pressure.
Certain foods can lower blood pressure.
Gaining weight can increase blood pressure.
Losing weight can reduce blood pressure.
What should I eat to control high blood pressure?
Eat foods lower in fat, salt, and calories.
Use spices and herbs, vinegar, lemon or fruit juices instead of salt to flavour foods.
Use less oil, butter, margarine, shortening, and salad dressings.
What are some of the foods I should eat?
Skim or 1% milk, yoghurt, Greek yoghurt (calcium-rich foods can lower blood pressure).
Lean meat.
Skinless turkey and chicken.
Low-salt, ready-to-eat cereals.
Cooked hot cereal (not instant).
Low-fat and low-salt cheeses.
Fruits (fresh, frozen, or canned without added salt).
Vegetables (fresh, frozen or canned, no added salt).Richly coloured green, orange, and red items are high in potassium and minerals that help lower blood pressure.The goal is 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day.
Plain rice, pasta, and potatoes.
Bread (English muffins, bagels, rolls, and tortillas).
Lower salt ""prepared"" convenience food.
Unsalted seeds (pumpkin, squash, sunflower) and unsalted nuts are mineral-rich foods that lower blood pressure.

Fast foods.
Deli meats.
What's the difference between sodium and salt?
Salt is mostly sodium, a mineral that occurs naturally in foods. Sodium is the substance that may cause your blood pressure to increase. Other forms of sodium are also present in food. MSG (monosodium glutamate) is another example of a sodium added to food (common in Chinese food).
How does salt increase blood pressure?
When you eat too much salt, which contains sodium, your body holds extra water to ""wash"" the salt from your body. In some people, this may cause blood pressure to rise. The added water puts stress on your heart and blood vessels.
How much sodium is too much?
The American Heart Association recommends limiting daily sodium intake no more than 1,500 milligrams. (A teaspoon of salt has about 2,400 milligrams of sodium.) Most people greatly exceed these sodium guidelines.
How can I reduce my sodium intake?
Don't use table salt.
Read nutrition labels and choose foods lower in sodium.
Choose foods marked ""sodium-free,"" ""low sodium,"" and ""unsalted.""
Use salt substitutes (ask your healthcare provider first).
Don't use lite salt as a substitute.
Read content labels. (Contents are listed in order of greatest amount.)
Purchase sodium-free herbs and seasoning mix like Mrs Dash®.
What foods are high in sodium?
Processed foods such as lunch meats, sausage, bacon, and ham.
Canned soups, bouillon, dried soup mixes.
Deli meats.
Condiments (catsup, soy sauce, salad dressings).
Frozen and boxed mixes for potatoes, rice, and pasta.
Snack foods (pretzels, popcorn, peanuts, chips).
Pickled or marinated food in brine. (Vinegar- and lemon juice-based marinades are ok.)
What else should I do to change my diet?
Avoid alcohol.
Eat a variety of foods.
Eat foods high in dietary fibre (whole grain bread, cereals, pasta, fresh fruit, and vegetables).

c6f8b274,How long do blood pressure pills take to work?,"Start taking medicine for high blood pressure. How long do blood pressure pills take to work? Depend on the pills which pills are going to take for blood pressure.
Try making lifestyle changes first.
If your blood pressure is very high, over 160/100, or whenever any of the values is higher, you don't have to make a decision. You definitely need a medicine that will lower your blood pressure.
Key points to remember
For some people, lifestyle changes may be enough to lower blood pressure. Whether or not this is an option for you depends on how high your blood pressure is, whether you have other health problems, such as diabetes, and whether any of your organs have already been damaged. Your doctor may also take into account your chances of having other conditions, particularly heart disease.
Lifestyle changes are just as important as medicines to lower blood pressure and lower the risk of heart attack and stroke. Lifestyle changes include losing weight, eating healthy, being active, limiting sodium and alcohol, and not smoking.
If healthy habits aren't enough to lower your blood pressure to your goal, your doctor may recommend taking pills.
Most people who take high blood pressure pills need to take two or more types of pills that work together.
Even with pills, you will need healthy habits for the rest of your life to reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke."

Limiting salt intake
Reducing stress
Exercise
Weight loss
When measuring one’s own blood pressure, try to be consistent about the measurements
Use the same equipment
Same time of day
Same arm (left vs right)
Same body position. Seated, calmly with feet on ground and back against the chair’s back
Record the blood pressure in a log and also any circumstances that may effect the reading.(examples: Finished big breakfast, Took walk, Argued with wife)
Use the record to understand how life choices are effecting you. If blood pressure readings are consistently high, see a doctor.
Symptoms may or may not be present.
Headache
Dizziness
Blurred vision
Chest pain
Palpitations
Anxiousness
Perspiration
The body is not designed to withstand high blood pressure values. The heart will work harder to push blood through stiff and non-compliant blood vessels in hypertension. The result, like any muscle being worked, is enlargement of the heart. However, unlike biceps, the heart's function will be impaired as it enlarges.
Also, high pressures will lead to ‘sheer forces’ tearing the intimal lining (inner suface) of blood vessels. This is the type of damage that trigger strokes, heart attacks and dissecting aortic aneurysms (a dilating then tearing of the main, largest artery). The blood pressure at its worst, is the number apt to do the harm. What is measured at random moments is only a glimpse of how we are when other situations occur.
So, when blood pressure is high, even temporarily, it places vulnerable blood vessels at risk of damage. Small vessels in the eye and kidneys getting damage lead to two of the more common consequences from hypertension: retinopathy and nephropathy.
Your question, “Is a blood pressure of 160/90 high?” is yes. It should be a wake up alarm to investigating your health.
Hypertension is a silent killer. It is one of the leading risk factors, if not the most important risk for cardiovascular disease. Even more than weight, cholesterol and smoking."

1 Primary
2 Secondary
Primary is not due to any other disease.
Causes includes stress, sedentary life style, and mostly genetic.
Two types of primary hypertension, benign and malignant. Benign is easy to treat since bp won't be very high as in malignant, leads to disease after very long time.
Malignant is more dangerous, where blood pressure stays very high like 200/120, 230/140 and some time as less as 160/100. It's generally difficult to treat. All end Organ damage will manifest within 5 years if bp is not controlled adequately.
Secondary hypertension is due to any abnormal changes or disease of the organs such as kidney, nervous system or blood vessel, increased amount of thyroid hormone in the blood, etc.
Okay, first no cure.
Can be controlled and bp may become normal.
Natural:
Excercise regularly.
Aerobic
Cycling and/or jogging
Yoga and meditation
DASH diet
Salt restriction (<2gms of sodium/day)
Fruits/veg (adequate Potassium and magnesium)
- this is N/A for patients with end

Decrease dietary fat intake
Increased dietary fibre intake
Fluid restriction (only for patients with end stage kidney failure)
Others drink adequate amount of water

Along with drugs to decrease the blood pressure Drugs to control the disease that causes hypertension is also given in patients with secondary hypertension.
Please follow your docs prescription for drugs, taking medications that is meant to decrease your bp may decrease it too low if taken at high dosages/multiple drugs at a time. They have various unwanted side effects also. Hence not to be taken without consultation.
Natural ways are applicable for most people with hypertension, and are almost always safe. May not be easy to follow all, may not be easy to practice regularly. May not be effective if bp is very high due to secondary cause for example a condition called renal artery stenosis (where artery of kidney becomes narrow), where a drug or intervention by a professional is compulsory."
39b18620,Which blood pressure medicine has the least side effects?,"Perhaps because of my inability to answer your question, I assert that you have asked the wrong question. If you look up side effects, you will find a long list for any of them. While side effects are very important, they are not a good guide to selecting the best BP medicine for a particular person.
When PPIs first came out I heard a speaker address the high cost of these drugs with an implied comparison to the earlier acid reducers, the H2 blockers. “The most expensive drug is the one that does not work.”
For a BP medicine you want it to work, to be easy to take, to have tolerable side effects, to be affordable, to have few drug interaction, to be free of the need for laboratory monitoring, and to provide benefits beyond just controlling blood pressure
Over the years research the guidance regarding BP medicine of choice has changed. Starting with an ACE-inhibitor or ARB or with a dihydropyrodine calcium channel blocker is recommended with the next step bring to combine the two or to add a thiazide diuretic. Examples of these drug classes are lisinopril, losartan, amlodipine and chlorthalidone.
Any BP medicine can work too well dropping BP and causing dizziness. Most can cause erectile dysfunction.
ACE inhibitors cause chronic cough in 10 percent, and due to effects on the kidneys lab monitoring is needed. Due to effects on the kidneys they are recommended for people with diabetes. Most can be taken once a day. ARBs are similar but without the cough, but they cost more. Calcium channel blockers may cause swelling of the legs (edema), but they may help treat Raynaud's, and they may help prevent migraines. Diuretics can help with edema, but they need lab monitoring.
The guidelines for where to start in paragraph 4 above are in part based on what works, but also on health consequences. The chief reasons for controlling BP are to prevent stroke and heart attack. Medicine that controls BP without reduction in stroke and heart attack likely has not met its goal. Research on doxazosin, an alpha blocker, was stopped because it was triggering heart failure, but it is still a good choice if there are problems from an enlarged prostate.
Perhaps you did not want all this, and I didn't even answer the question you asked. Number of side effects does not lead to selecting the right drug. See your family physician."

effa3138,Does meditation really lower blood pressure?,"Will meditation remove or alleviate the cause of your hypertension? If the answer to this question is ""yes"" then the answer to your question is also ""yes"".
That of course assumes that your question has been motivated by concerns about hypertension. Otherwise why would you want to lower your blood pressure. As I have explained here (Lutz Kraushaar's answer to If blood pressure is high, what will be the cardiac rate?), blood pressure is your body's means to an end - to ensure sufficient blood flow to all organs - not an end in itself.
So, back to your question (and the assumption of hypertension): About 90% of diagnosed cases of hypertension have no identifiable cause. That is, your medical practitioner has no clue about the exact physiological pathway and cause behind your hypertension.
""No clue"" doesn't sound very academic, which is why we prefer to call it ""idiopathic"" (which definitely sounds as if we knew what we are talking about).
That's why there are so many different classes of drugs to treat hypertension. From beta-blockers to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) to calcium channel blockers, diuretics and alpha-blockers and more recently renin inhibitors.
In many cases hypertension is one of the side effects of endothelial dysfunction (ED) - the endothelium being the thin monolayer of cells that separate the interior arterial wall from the blood stream. ED doesn't happen over night. It is mostly the result of years of insult, typically from inadequate lifestyle choices.
But even with an intact endothelium there are ample reasons why blood pressure may become elevated.
For example when the lumen (the inner diameter) of the vessels is somewhat narrowed, which increases the resistance to blood flow. One way to overcome flow restrictions when resistance is high is to increase pressure. Which is what your organism is built to do.
Now, one of the reasons why your vessels may be narrowed is a constant contraction of the muscle cells that form the medial layer of your arteries. This vascular tone, as it is called, is the result of a very complex interaction between vasodilatory (vessel widening) and vasoconstrictive (vessel narrowing) pathways.
And one surefire way to give vasoconstriction the upper hand is constant stress. But, remember, that's only one of the many causes.
If that is the cause of your hypertension, then, yes, meditation might help you quite a bit, as long as it also alleviates your stress experience.
In clinical research meditation practices, such as transcendental meditation and the mindfulness meditative practices have shown some effects, but they were relatively small.
That, however, should not discourage anybody from trying meditation. For one simple reason: as long as medical science cannot pinpoint the exact cause of anyone's hypertension, it cannot investigate properly how large the effect of any intervention might be that targets this specific cause."

Recently 2 ladies reported with low blood pressure. The details are -

Used to drink 3 glasses of water with every meals.
She called up at 7.30 pm before dinner.
As asked her to drink only 1 glass of water within dinner and then report the BP on next morning.
Next day morning her BP was 100/68. Feedback was on whatsapp. Screen shot is in beginning of video. This is mobile converation recording with patient's husband.
2.
Age 60, weight 58, diabetic with fasting average sugar of 375. BP 90/54. She used to drink hot water on empty stomach. Her overall fluid intake was very high. She used to drink 4 cups of tea.
She was asked to drink 1 glass of water with each meal. Besides this she was to take only 1 sip when thirsty limiting the total fluid intake to 4 glasses a day.
On day 5 her fasting sugar was 225. She continued her medicines that was the reason for slow drop in blood sugar. Her BP was 120/76.
Mobile recording of patient.
Explanation
When a person drinks too much water, most of this water is absorbed in large intestines causing excess fluid in cells. That lowers the minerals concentration in cells. So blood supplies minerals to cells and in the process blood volume ia reduced.
That causes low blood volume due to water not getting absorbed in small intestines.
The blood volume hits the lower end causing low blood volume and thirst. That is vicious circle. more u drink more thirsty u will feel.

How the Body Replaces Blood?
During a whole blood donation we aim to take just under a pint (about 470mls) of blood, which works out at no more than 13 per cent of your blood volume. After donation, your body has an amazing capacity to replace all the cells and fluids that have been lost.
Take red cells. Millions of them are being made and dying every second. When you give blood you lose red cells and the body needs to make more to replace them. Special cells in the kidneys, called peritubular cells, sense that the level of oxygen in the blood has decreased (due to the loss of red cells) and start secreting a protein called erythropoietin. This passes through the bloodstream until it reaches the bone marrow (the soft fatty tissue inside the bone cavities). The bone marrow produces stem cells, the building blocks that the body uses to make the different blood cells – red cells, white cells and platelets. The erythropoietin sends a message to the stem cells telling more of them to develop into red blood cells, rather than white cells or platelets.
Your body makes about two million new red cells every second, so it doesn’t take long to build up stores of them again. What about your white cells and platelets? A number of other messenger proteins also stimulate the production of these cells in the bone marrow, and over the next few days levels return to normal.
Why Wait?
So why wait 16 weeks between whole blood donations? Well, unlike white cells and platelets, it takes several weeks for all the red cells to be replaced. There’s an important link between your red cells and your health because it’s these cells, or rather the red-coloured haemoglobin they contain, that take oxygen around your body. Haemoglobin contains iron and some is lost with each blood donation. To compensate, iron is mobilised from the body's iron stores, and the body also increases the amount of iron it absorbs from food and drink. Any iron deficiency can result in reduced haemoglobin levels, and eventually, if not treated, in iron deficiency anaemia. This deficiency can make you feel tired, which is why, as well as asking you to wait 16 weeks to donate whole blood, we also test your haemoglobin levels every time you give. We make sure that your haemoglobin level is above 125g/l for women and135g/l for men.
Iron levels
The body stores iron in the form of two proteins –ferritin (in men it accounts for about 70 per cent of stored iron, in women 80 percent) and haemosiderin. The proteins are found in the liver, bone marrow, spleen and muscles. If too much iron is taken out of storage and not replaced through dietary sources, iron stores may become depleted and haemoglobin levels fall. After a donation, most people’s haemoglobin levels are back to normal after six to twelve weeks. We ask you to wait 16 weeks to ensure that if you are a dedicated loyal donor who never misses a donation, we don’t risk lowering your haemoglobin levels over the long term. You can help your iron levels by eating a variety of iron-rich foods. On average men need to replace about 1mg of iron per day, women 2mg. With a balanced diet, getting enough iron shouldn’t be a problem. Foods such as lean red meat, poultry, fish, leafy green vegetables, brown rice, lentils and beans can all boost your haemoglobin. Vitamin C helps with iron absorption, so to get the most from the food you eat, drink a glass of vitamin C-rich fruit juice with your meal.
Drink up
Blood volume makes up approximately eight per cent of your body weight. About 55 percent of blood is comprised of plasma, of which 90 per cent is water. So although you donate less than a pint of blood at a time, almost half of this is water. That’s why it is important for you to drink plenty of water (we would like you to drink at least 500ml), just before you donate and immediately after you’ve donated. It’s important to replace fluids after you’ve donated, to help bring your blood volume levels back to normal. The kidneys also play their part in controlling blood volume by regulating the amount of sodium and water lost in urine.
Feeling faint
After donation some people can feel faint. When the body loses blood, special nerve cells in the walls of the arteries of the neck, called baroreceptors, sense that your blood pressure has dropped. The blood vessels constrict to compensate for this loss and to keep the blood pressure normal. Standing up too quickly, for example, can cause an abrupt drop in your blood pressure and make you feel light headed. Lying on the couch restores blood flow to the brain as your head will be at the same level as your heart. Sitting on the edge of the donation bed with your feet hanging down for at least two minutes will also help, as it allows your blood pressure to stabilise itself before you stand up. If you are feeling faint, our staff will ask you to stay at the session until you feel well again.
(NBTS)
We medical folk have ways of classifying 'shock' due to loss of circulating volume. The categories range from Class I shock to Class IV, with Class IV signifying a loss of 40% of circulating volume (usually 2000 mls +)
Class I shock - the first classification can occur with volume loss of 750ml and can be associated with the onset of symptoms, eg slightly elevated respiratory rate, narrowed pulse pressure, mild anxiety. It is important to avoid potentially inducing these symptoms in an otherwise well person and so the amount taken is a good percent lower than this amount.

It takes about two weeks to produce a fresh red blood cell, but production ramps up a bit after donation because of the drop in red cell mass, so even while losing (via recycling in the spleen) worn-out red cells during the recovery period from donation, it still takes about two weeks to replace the red cell component of blood. The lost fluid volume is replaced within hours to a day. (By the way, a ""unit"" of blood in the U.S. is about 300 milliliters, not a pint.)
Jackson David Reynolds, BS, Biology; AS, Chemistry
Written Mar 15, 2015
The renewal of all hematologic components does not take place simultaneously. For example, after donating a unit of whole blood, the average person will replenish the lost VOLUME within 24-48 hours (depending on rate of post-donation fluid intake), but it takes around eight weeks for the donor's body to replenish all of the formed elements (erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets) lost during the donation.
Theoretically, one can SURVIVE after losing about half one's total blood volume, but this would be spectacularly dangerous. From a practical standpoint of donor risk minimization, however, the safe upper limit would really be closer to one ""unit"" (what most people think of as a ""pint"") of whole blood, or a double unit of red cells (of the same total volume), separated by aphaeresis.

What part of the blood are you talking about? You replace the water in a day, the protein in about a week, the platelets in about a week, and the red cells not for 3 weeks or more. That last part is what keeps you from donating very often.

Originally Answered: How much time does the human body take to recover its blood after donating 450 ml?As an example, on average a normal, healthy individual who donates a unit of blood (about 450 ml or ¾ pint) will fully recuperate from the blood loss in four to six weeks.
The issue is a bit more complicated than that though. You see, our blood is made up of a variety of things:
Red blood cells that carry oxygen from the lungs to all other tissues in the body.
White blood cells that provide the body's defenses against disease.
Platelets, specialized cells that plug damaged blood vessel walls and join other elements in the blood in the production of clots to stop bleeding.
Plasma, a yellow fluid made up of about 92% water and 7% vital proteins such as albumin, gamma globulin, and antihemophilic and other clotting factors.
And other elements consisting of mineral salts, sugar, fats, hormones, and vitamins.
Red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets account for about 45% of the volume of blood in the body. The remaining 55% is plasma including the other extraneous elements I mentioned. The four to six-week period I indicated a moment ago is the time necessary to replace ALL these factors, though our bodies actually replace some of the individual components faster than others. For example, the fluid
(mostly water) lost in a blood donation, is replaced in only a few hours, provided the donor drinks a moderate amount of water or healthy, non-alcoholic liquids to replenish the loss. The other components of the blood, such as platelets and red cells begin to replenish immediately but take a bit longer to complete; usually within a few days or weeks depending on how much blood is lost. Generally speaking, after donating a unit of blood, the body replaces the fluid and white cells within 24 hours, and platelets and plasma proteins within 48-72 hours. The red blood cells are completely replaced in 4-6 weeks.

Originally Answered: How long does it take for the human body to replace a pint of blood?The lifespan of a red cell is about 120 days, so you make about one tenth of a pint per day as normal balance. You can replace lost blood quicker than that but I'd say a week to ten days to make a pint.

c4fd6fa1,"Can a headache increase your blood pressure, or can blood pressure changes cause a headache?","I am Martha Nguyen. I would like to share some high blood pressure tricks from Rose Campbell’s website: Top 8 tips that can help to lower your high blood pressure in just 9 mins. Rose Campbell is a famous blogger about blood pressure.
Rose Campbell’s Tip 1: Lose weight. Being overweight means that your heart has to pump blood to a larger body mass, which makes the heart work harder. Losing weight reduces the workload. “Plus, your heart will be better able to respond to circumstances that do require more work, like exercise,” says Dr. Zusman.
Rose Campbell’s Tip 2: Exercise. Any activity that gets your heart pumping faster and your lungs working harder is one of the best ways to lower high blood pressure. “It improves the blood vessels’ ability to open and close, which improves blood flow,” says Dr. Zusman. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.
Rose Campbell’s Tip 3: Reduce your stress. Chronic stress may contribute to high blood pressure. More research is needed to determine the effects of chronic stress on blood pressure. Occasional stress also can contribute to high blood pressure if you react to stress by eating unhealthy food, drinking alcohol or smoking.
Rose Campbell’s Tip 4: Reduce sodium in your diet
Rose Campbell’s Tip 5: Control underlying conditions.
Rose Campbell’s Tip 6: Stop caffeine.
Rose Campbell’s Tip 7: Limit alcohol intake.
Rose Campbell’s Tip 8: Stop smoking.

993af37e,Why does working out lower your blood pressure?,"How exercise can lower your blood pressure
How are high blood pressure and exercise connected? Regular physical activity makes your heart stronger. A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort. If your heart can work less to pump, the force on your arteries decreases, lowering your blood pressure.
Becoming more active can lower your systolic blood pressure — the top number in a blood pressure reading — by an average of 4 to 9 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). That's as good as some blood pressure medications. For some people, getting some exercise is enough to reduce the need for blood pressure medication.
If your blood pressure is at a desirable level — less than 120/80 mm Hg — exercise can help prevent it from rising as you age. Regular exercise also helps you maintain a healthy weight — another important way to control blood pressure.
But to keep your blood pressure low, you need to keep exercising on a regular basis. It takes about one to three months for regular exercise to have an impact on your blood pressure. The benefits last only as long as you continue to exercise.
How much exercise do you need?
Aerobic activity can be an effective way to control high blood pressure. But flexibility and strengthening exercises such as lifting weights are also important parts of an overall fitness plan. You don't need to spend hours in the gym every day to benefit from aerobic activity. Simply adding moderate physical activities to your daily routine will help.
Any physical activity that increases your heart and breathing rates is considered aerobic activity, including:
·
Household chores, such as mowing the lawn, raking leaves, gardening or scrubbing the floor
·
Active sports, such as basketball or tennis
·
Climbing stairs
·
Walking
·
Jogging
·
Bicycling
·
Swimming
·
Dancing
The Department of Health and Human Services recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity most days of the week.
If you can't set aside that much time at once, remember that shorter bursts of activity count, too. You can break up your workout into three 10-minute sessions of aerobic exercise and get the same benefit as one 30-minute session.
Also, if you sit for several hours a day, try to reduce the amount of time you spend sitting. Research has found that too much sedentary time can contribute to many health conditions. Aim for five to 10 minutes of low-intensity physical activity — such as getting up to get a drink of water or going on a short walk — each hour. Consider setting a reminder in your email calendar or on your smartphone.
Weight training and high blood pressure
Weight training can cause a temporary increase in blood pressure during exercise. This increase can be dramatic, depending on how much weight you lift.
But weightlifting can also have long-term benefits to blood pressure that outweigh the risk of a temporary spike for most people. And it can improve other aspects of cardiovascular health that can help to reduce overall cardiovascular risk. The Department of Health and Human Services recommends incorporating strength training exercises of all the major muscle groups into a fitness routine at least two times a week.
If you have high blood pressure and you'd like to include weight training in your fitness program, remember:
·
Learn and use proper form. Using proper form and technique when weight training reduces the risk of injury.
·
Don't hold your breath. Holding your breath during exertion can cause dangerous spikes in blood pressure. Instead, breathe easily and continuously during each exercise.
·
Lift lighter weights more times. Heavier weights require more strain, which can cause a greater increase in blood pressure. You can challenge your muscles with lighter weights by increasing the number of repetitions you do.
·
Listen to your body. Stop your activity right away if you become severely out of breath or dizzy, or if you experience chest pain or pressure.
If you have high blood pressure, get your doctor's OK before adding weight training exercises to your fitness routine.

7d21824a,What can high blood pressure cause?,"With my patients I remind them that Hypertension is called the ""silent killer."" Eventually it will kill you without giving you any signs or symptoms. This of course happens over years, unless you have a major arterial rupture in the brain at a weaken area, usually the brain called an aneurysm.
The slow and steady ways are kidney failure, and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). The kidney is composed of millions of small hair like blood vessels. When blood pressure is high these hair-like blood vessels rupture and are never repaired. This will eventually lead to severe kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis to keep you alive. This is a 6 hour procedure 3 times a week. nothing to look forward too.
Now for CHF. If I made you bend your arm every time your heart beat your arm would get tired, but it would not get bigger. Now if I added a small weight to your hand and you had to lift that weight your arm would also tire but it would also get bigger. If you plucked a small chunk of hear muscle and a small chunk of arm muscle you could put them side by side and not be able to tell the difference. However under a microscope you would see a slight difference in the heart muscle. So being similar heart muscle will enlarge with extra effort. Pumping against high blood pressure is generally extra effort.
Now put your hands together as you did when you were a child. Remember squeezing those hands and causing them to eject water up ""like a clam"" we used to say. now bend the fingers of one hand outward and leave a big space between your closed hands. Now imagine trying to squeeze them underwater. Not much water coming up, right? well that is how the heart works. The heart squeezes against itself. as it becomes bigger the less it functions as a pump.
The athletes heart pumps say 75% out each time it beats. the Very young adult say 65%, and the functional older heart 55%. Now imagine an enlarging heart pumping less than 55%, and gradually getting to 40% You are now in CHF.
The average white person in America gets CHF around 55 years old. 50% are dead by 60 years old. the rest straggle on for a few years at most. No medications, no procedures, no surgical interventions. Just impending death. That is CHF.
CHF where your output is 40% means the body's organs are not getting the blood supply they need and begin a slow process of dying. CHF with a cardiac output of around 20% and you are a cardiac cripple, unable to walk across a room without exhaustion. Our African- American population have 3 times more Hypertension than white Americans. So you would think 3 times more CHF. Not three times more 20! They can see it as early as 35 years old, yet they still die five years later.
Control your blood pressure. Diet has a limited potential look into medication."

6ce2856c,What is the reason for low blood pressure?,"There are a number of possible causes for a fall in blood pressure. Blood pressure is a complex interplay of the amount of blood flowing out of the heart (cardiac output) and the size of the small arteries (arterioles) in your body ( this latter item is known as peripheral resistance)
The amount of blood flowing out of the heart depends on the amount of circulating blood, how well it returns to the heart through veins and the strength of the heart to fill and empty properly. The heart rate if it is very low or very high can also affect the amount of blood leaving the heart over a extended period time.
So one could think of examples where there is a large loss of blood or a blood clot prevents blood flow returning to the heart or a weakness of the muscle of the heart from poor blood supply as a cause. The function of the valves in the heart is also important. If the valves are too narrow ( valvular stenosis) or if they leak too much ( valvular regurgitation), this will also affect the amount of blood that is leaving the heart.
The resistance of the small arteries in the body is affected by a number of items. These include activity in sympathetic nerves, parasympathetic nerves circulating catecholamines, medications and the metabolic needs of the local tissues.
So now to answer your question “why the blood pressure could fall “ there are a number of possibilities. It is also important to note here that the speed of change in one of the variables discussed above will also determine the magnitude of the fall in blood pressure; a gradual change may not cause much change in blood pressure while a sudden change will cause a large fall in blood pressure. There could be any number of causes of low blood pressure acting either individually or together. A large amount of bleeding, a blood clot forming in a leg in the leg, dislodging and travelling to and lodging in the pulmonary artery will decrease the amount of blood returning to the heart. Weakness of the heart muscle from poor blood supply as in blockage of a coronary artery, weakness of the heart muscle following chronic valve disease or a viral infection can reduce the amount of blood leaving the heart.
A decrease in the resistance of arterial vessels could occur from decreased sympathetic innervation to the vessels. This occurs in the situation following administration of spinal or epidural anaesthesia after a severe injury to the spinal cord causing paralysis in the legs. A reflex from severe stretching of the bowel or the bladder can increase parasympathetic stimuli to the arteries with a resultant decrease in resistance known as vasodilatation.. In some individuals their response to stress is to faint. In this situation, it appears that the heart rate instead of increasing actually decreases and there may also be a decrease in vascular resistance . The sudden drop in blood pressure which results causes the patient to lose consciousness And fall to the floor. The described changes in heart rate and blood pressure quickly revert to normal blood pressure rises and the patient begins consciousness.
finally there are medications which are taken to reduce abnormally elevated blood pressure. These act primarily by reducing peripheral vascular resistance. They may also have mild effects on the circulating blood volume and the pumping strength of the heart.
To determine the cause of low blood pressure in a particular situation can be"
06c6484e,What if we take high blood pressure tablets when we are having low blood pressure?,"The reason why their blood pressure has stabilized may be due to those meds so unless they are dizzy or syncopal they should not stop the medicine and always consult their practitioner if they are having symptoms which are making them uncomfortable because it may be unrelated to the anti-hypertensive medication.
If a person was never hypertensive in the first place lowering the blood pressure may cause them to have difficulty mentating or they may pass out and hurt themselves. Poor cardiac profusion or profusion to the kidneys may also cause havoc."
101d6369,Does drinking water lower blood pressure?,"Your blood pressure can go up or down depending on your physical and
mental state.
Is is all to do with osmosis. Osmosis is the biological phenomenon whereby water moves across a semi-permeable membrane (eg. the walls of a blood vessel) from an area of high water concentration to an area low water concentration. Eg. suppose you put a balloon filled with pure water into a glass of salt water. The water will move out of the balloon, causing it to shrink. When there is less water in the balloon, there is less pressure on the walls of the balloon.
The same thing happens with your blood vessels. The more water you drink, the more fluids leave the blood vessel, causing your vessels to relax and your blood pressure to reduce. Conversely if you have lots of salt in your diet, this causes the opposite. The water goes into the blood vessels, building up pressure. If the pressure is too high, the blood vessel will burst like a balloon. This is how hypertension causes stroke and kidney disease.
Although water does not significantly raise blood pressure, chronic dehydration causes high blood pressure by making the body to hold onto sodium. This increases blood volume and thus blood pressure.
Most people have heard of the eight-glasses-a-day rule, even if they don't abide by it. Divide your body weight in two-- in ounces -- is how much water you should aim to drink per day minimum.
Drinking adequate amounts of water can help lower your blood pressure."
0dbad6e7,My blood pressure is 150/80. Is it normal?,"First thing you need to do is to take a deep breath…OK< make that 5 deep breaths… 4 seconds of inhalation, 2 seconds of hold, 4 seconds of exhalation. Repeat 4 more times.
Good
Now take a second reading of your blood pressure.
BP measurement is notorious for being off, especially if you use one of these automatic cuff machine types. If a trained medical professional (a nurse, a physician or a trained medical technologist) is taking the b.p. reading using a stethoscope, they might get it right the first time. But if it is a home machine, then it is always better to take 2 readings, maybe 3 if you have the time.
Once you have your readings, discard the reading that looks “off”, if there is one that is a clear outlier. This is because sometimes the machines can be wrong.
A reading like 150/80 looks unusual to me, because your diastolic pressure is spot on normal, and your systolic pressure is higher than expected.
A second reading will either confirm that the first reading is valid, or it will tell you that the fist reading is abnormal, and needs to be disregarded.
It is always best to look at trends over a period of days or weeks, where you take the b.p. reading at roughly the same time each day and track how your blood pressure changes with the days. A little bit of +/- is acceptable, but rarely do you find an odd reading like 150/80 being reproduced time after time.
It is possible to alter your bp reading significantly on purpose, if you do weird things just before taking the blood pressure reading. I will not go into how to do these, because I don’t want anyone to start playing mischief with your medical professionals. I assume that you have not done anything like that before you got this first reading. If you did, then you are not helping anyone… least of all, yourself."

You need at least a pressure of 60 mmHg systolic to perfuse your brain. Anything less and you can get ischemic.
When you hemorrhage your blood pressure drops like crazy due to volume loss. The lack of blood and inability of your heart to maintain adequate systolic pressure due to the volume loss results in shock. Sepsis causes a volume shortage by causing vessels to expand all over the body leading to low blood pressure and death. Neurogenic shock does the same thing. Cardiac shock results in a loss of pumping power from the heart, this leads to a drop in blood pressure which leads to death.

6f47fef3,Which herbs or vitamins are good to eliminate high blood pressure?,"High blood pressure needs immediate precautions to bring it down. You can easily miss its initial symptoms till it gets too late to make amends. Which is why, Ayurveda recommends to follow a controlled diet and lifestyle that can keep a check on your blood pressure throughout the day. As per Ayurveda, following dincarya (daily regime) and ritucarya (seasonal regime) is essential to oversee hypertension. So, here are some eating habits you can adopt in your every day life for controlling BP efficiently:
Avoid spicy, sour and salty foods like chillies, ready-to-eat preparations and refined flour products. Take your meals on time and avoid binge eating after sunset.
Add nourishing foods like green gram, wheat, carrot, flax seeds, sesame seeds, pomegranate, Amla, beetroot, red cabbage, garlic, ghee and milk to your daily diet.
Make it a habit to consume supper early in the evening. Incorporate sweet, astringent and bitter food sources in it as they reduce blood toxicity.
Further, you can top up your diet with some Ayurvedic herbs like Punarnava, Ginger etc. that can lower the blood pressure and prevent its complications. Here are some easy remedies for doing so:
Drink dry ginger herbal tea in the morning hours, if your high blood pressure is triggered by consuming untimely meals or refrigerated food.
Consume Amalaki or Gokshura powder/tablets every day, if you are exceedingly indulgent in junk food.
Hypertension caused by stress, anxiety or intake of alcohol/acidic food can be curbed with Arjuna and Shatavari.
For prolonged complaint of hypertension, drink Moringa leaf juice with honey regularly. Make sure to consult your physician for getting your dosage guidelines
Boil some Garlic cloves in milk and drink it with honey. It is a sureshot remedy for controlling high blood pressure.
If you find these remedies too hassling, you can also try Nirogam’s Hypershun
tablets. It is composed of Giloy, Ashwagandha, Mandukaparni, Vacha, Mandukpishti, Praval pishti and many more BP-regulating herbs that nourish the kidney, spleen and intestine tissues, while lowering your average blood pressure readings.
Hope this helps you to manage your BP problems better!"
1a993882,Why does my blood pressure fluctuate?,"1. Food Sensitivities
Some people will have changing blood pressure due to being sensitive to certain foods. In most cases, the blood pressure would dramatically rise after eating a trigger food. This is particularly common for those with salt sensitivities after taking very salty meals. Usually, this can return to normal for a while. Yet, you many need to make some diet changes, if such swings in pressure occur frequently.
2. Stress
When we are stressed, our bodies increase blood sugar, blood pressure, respiration rate, and heart rate. In a stressful situation, peripheral arteries constrict, making the heart work harder to get oxygenated blood throughout tissues in the body. Occasional stress isn't typically a concern but frequently experiencing it can cause chronic fluctuations in blood pressure which may be harmful.
3. Caffeine Consumption
As a stimulant, coffee produces a temporary rise in blood pressure. Drinking three or four cups may increase your blood pressure 4 to 13 mmHg. If you don't regularly have caffeine, you may notice more significant fluctuations. Experts don't know why caffeine increases blood pressure but think it may be due to constriction of blood vessels.
4. Medications
Certain medications, including over-the-counter ones, may lead to temporary elevations in blood pressure. These include anti-inflammatory meds, decongestants, and acetaminophen. You can experience worse fluctuations from illegal street drugs, leading to life-threatening situations.
5. Adrenal Fatigue
Your adrenals regulate multiple hormones in the body and can seriously affect your cardiovascular health. If your adrenals are fatigued due to an extended illness or excessive/chronic stress, they can't regulate your blood pressure properly.
6. Fever
A fever is a sign that your body is fighting an infection. Since a fever speeds up your heart rate, it increases your blood pressure due to the narrowing blood vessels. It is very common to notice fluctuating blood pressure during a fever or other sickness.
7. Deposits of Calcium or Cholesterol in the Arteries
If you have calcium and/or cholesterol deposits in your arteries, they will become stiff and inelastic. This makes them incapable of relaxing and causes hypertension. This condition is most common among those who are middle-aged or older and stiff arteries may also lead to systolic hypertension.
8. Dehydration
Dehydration can also lead to fluctuations with a dramatic decrease. You can just regain water retention to raise your blood pressure by increasing the blood volume.

306d3d05,My blood pressure is 140/70. Is it high?,"Okay, good question! Actually, I'm a medical student hope my answer would be helpful to you!
What actually blood pressure is? It is the pressure which is exerted by the blood on the arteries ( in which the blood is flowing ) during the contraction of the left ventricle.
If we talk about the normal blood pressure range it's like - 90/60 to 120 / 80…its the range given on the books…but nowadays due to our living style, the type of food we eat, the type of work we engaged with etc has influenced it…140 / 70 is considered normal in adults due to all the factors I discussed above…
But if it is above 160/100( hypertension ) and below 80/60 ( hypotension ) then it could be harmful and can lead to cardiovascular diseases…Both the conditions are fatal…
Here I'm discussing the preventions.
For hypertensive patients -
1- change your living style.
2 - avoid more consumption of salt as salt has the property to cause water retention in the body hence cause increased blood volume and therefore increased blood pressure.
3- Maintain our weight as overweight causes hypertension.
4- exercise daily.
5- reduce stress as it causes secretion of some hormones that cause high bp.
6- Avoid the consumption of alcohol and say no to smoking.
7- say no to fast food…as they cause accumulation of fat/cholesterol in the blood vessels causing their narrowing hence increased blood pressure.
8- eat daily a slice of garlic in the morning as garlic has the property to reduce the amount of cholesterol/ fat accumulated in the blood vessels ( by melting )
Thanks!
This is my first answer on quora since have joined here…

2138eff0,Does anemia affect blood pressure?,"If the reason that you are anemic is because you are having chronic insidious blood loss or destruction of cells due to a valvular problem, having chemo, or short cell life, a person may be hypotensive and dizzy, short of breath and intolerant of exercise.
There are some anemias which do not alter BP. But sometimes when patients are particularly symptomatic they may need to have a transfusion to make things right. Your Hematologist can be helpful in explaining this issue."
1fe34d37,How does potassium reduce blood pressure?,"Via 2 pathways (I’ll explain them in laymen terms below this list):
direct: vasodilation via hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle.
indirect: increased sodium excretion via the kidneys.
The direct effect:
Contrary to sodium, potassium is a directly vasoactive agent, that is, it has a direct effect on the vascular vessels.
The cellular concentration of potassium, the most abundant ion in all animal cells, is regulated by an enzyme that actively pumps sodium out of and potassium into the cell. This so-called sodium-potassium channel (or Na+-K+ pump) ensures that the concentration of sodium is always higher outside the cell, and the concentration of potassium is always higher on the inside.
The net result is a negative charge on the inside and a positive charge on the cell’s outside, the difference being the membrane potential.
In the case of vascular smooth muscle cells any signal that triggers a depolarization of their membranes’ resting potential stimulates the cells to contract.
When that happens over any length of a vessel, the vessel diameter is being reduced, which increases the pressure in the vessel.
Our current understanding of the role of potassium in regulating blood pressure is that increasing potassium supply (though dietary means or supplementation) may lead to hyperpolarization of the vascular medial smooth muscle cells.
Hyperpolarization means that the cells need a larger stimulus than normal to contract. That is, they are more resistant to anything that promotes a blood pressure increasing reduction of vessel diameter.
That affects not only larger vessels but also the vascular beds of small vessels, which are the vessels that regulate peripheral resistance. The more constricted they are, the higher the resistance in the entire arterial system, the higher the blood pressure.
The vascular beds of the kidneys play an important role in the regulation of systemic resistance. And the vascular beds of the brain may also be affected.
The indirect effect:
Dietary increase in potassium can stimulate an increased sodium chloride excretion via urine, which may have a lowering effect on blood pressure in the presence of high sodium intake.
That is why supplementation with potassium may have an effect on blood pressure, but the effects are neither immediate nor guaranteed. Dietary or supplemental increase of potassium acts with a time delay of weeks, and may not materialize at all due to the organism’s possible compensatory responses."
a9c56b9c,What is the cure to blood pressure or atleast how do I rectify it?,"Hypertension secondary to kidney dysfunction is cured when the underlying renal problem is taken care of. Treating pheochromocytoma, initially with drugs and then through resection, will normalize blood pressure.
For ‘essential’ hypertension, one with no known cause, also known as primary or idiopathic hypertension, the story is a bit different. The accompanying atherosclerosis/arteriosclerosis and the desensitization of the baroreceptor control make the cure of hypertension less likely.
That said, if caught early, when these permanent changes have not yet taken a foothold, lifestyle changes such as weight loss, a good diet, avoidance of toxicants such as tobacco, alcohol, air pollutants, exercise and stress management can normalize blood pressure and keep it optimal for the rest of one’s life.
Before a physician should think of placing someone in the early stage of essential hypertension on an antihypertensive drug, these lifestyle changes must first be prescribed. It is only when these measures are not heeded or do not succeed to lower hypertension, should drugs be prescribed.
Late stage essential hypertension requires drug treatment to bring blood pressure down to acceptable levels."
bbd66216,What is the best time to check blood pressure?,"It is well past midnight; everyone has slept; excepting those few unblinking youngsters focused on the LCD screen; veterans in black, working on the wrong side of law on the streets; men in khaki with batons, looking out for veterans in black; the night riders!
That’s the best time for recording blood pressure; and I am not joking.
Last year, we have published one of the worlds largest database of ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) trial involving 27,472 patients in India.
Blood pressure is a variable parameter; it goes up when you are angry, stressed, hungry or fatigued; and you have all these when you visit your doctor in the hospital. The ‘white coat hypertension’ is no longer a myth but a textbook chapter, where the in-clinic BP is high with a normal BP at home.
That brought in the concept of 24-hour ambulatory BP. An apparatus that records BP 24/7.
Why do we measures BP? It is to predict a cardiovascular event in the future. Ambulatory BP data has clearly shown that of all the timings of BP recording (Day, 24-hour, night) the nighttime BP has the best predictability to warn us for a cardiac event. (Look at the graph - steepest is night BP)
If you are measuring BP at home with a home BP monitor, the best way is to average multiple readings - Morning, noon and night, At least 2 readings each set. Record BP in sitting pose, with back supported, legs on the floor (not dangling). BP cuff over unclothed arm. No coffee, tea within 30 minutes prior to the record. Not within an hour of major meals.
If any doubt, ask your doctor about need for an ambulatory BP. It is widely available, and not prohibitively expensive.
Get one fixed, go home and sleep.
Provided you don’t belong to those night riders we talked about."
7c3143ab,What is the highest blood pressure level ever measured in a person?,"You will probably not believe this, but my own record is 340/?.
I was in critical care with idiopathic multiple organ failure. I had heart failure, kidney failure, pneumonia, bronchitis and a pulmonary oedema. Additionally, I also had some problems with my pancreas. It was getting to the end of the year (I teach maths to Adults) and there is a contractual thing that all the learners get a certain number of guided learning hours, and since it is only a small college, cover is hard to come by…. anyway, I probably worked for longer than I should have, and only went to see somebody when I was unable to lie down without my lungs filling up.
I had been in critical care for a day or two, and was on a ventilator, with my family around me. I should have been out of it with all the drugs in me, but I had been vaguely aware of something going on, and opened my eyes. Don’t ask me what I thought I saw (very trippy) but I have been told I was very keen to communicate. I had an arterial line giving a continuous BP reading, and apparently when the consultant saw it was, he panicked a little, and pumped some more drugs in me to calm me down. At the time, I was given a 5% chance of survival, and if I did come home, I probably would be “different” (allusion to brain damage probably)
I survived (obviously), and was back to work in time for the new academic year. I had a stent in one of my renal arteries and 2 in my heart. I was on dialysis for a couple of years as I was left with <5% kidney function. Last summer, I had a kidney transplant, and I am pleased to report, am feeling better than I have done for years.
Also, miraculously, apart from the 2 weeks I lost when the incident first happened, I have only had 1 day off sick in the past 4 years (I am on immuno-suppressants and am apparently very susceptible to anything going.) I laugh inside when I see my class numbers plummet due to winter flu (they are adults, so they may need to miss class looking after a sick child) while this year so far, my attendance is 100%
I guess I am very lucky to have been born with such a strong constitution. I am totally stubborn and nobody can get me to change my mind once it is set. In Intensive Care, I knew I was in some sort of struggle, didn’t know what, but I guess I am mentally pretty strong, got into a massive stubborn streak and was NOT going to die. I was probably in that mindset when my BP went really high.
So, no stroke, no haemorhaging, BUT I know life is too short to worry about stuff, so am pretty chilled. The doctors still don’t know what caused all this.
Also, I became a minor celebrity in the hospital, and was invited to a special breakfast with the various consultants and doctors who were still scratching their heads and trying to work out 1) what happened, and 2) how I survived relatively unscathed. Nothing was written up though, as these are very busy people performing miracles on a daily basis."

a878633b,Is a blood pressure of 130/80 high?,"Blood pressure of 120/80 or above is considered elevated; 130/80 to 139/89 is now considered Stage 1 hypertension and anything 140/90 or above will be considered stage 2 hypertension. ... Previously, people were not considered to have high blood pressure until the top reading hit 140.
The new guideline adopts a key component of the 2013 cholesterol guideline and incorporates overall cardiovascular risk.

The new guideline adopts a key component of the 2013 cholesterol guideline and incorporates overall cardiovascular risk. Many people newly defined as hypertensive because they have a systolic blood pressure between 130-139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure between 80-89 mm Hg do not need to take drugs.
The previous guidelines set the threshold at 140/90 mm Hg for people younger than age 65 and 150/80 mm Hg for those ages 65 and older. This means 70% to 79% of men ages 55 and older are now classified as having hypertension. That includes many men whose blood pressure had previously been considered healthy.
A hypertensive crisis is a severe increase in blood pressure that can lead to a stroke. Extremely high blood pressure — a top number (systolic pressure) of 180 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher or a bottom number (diastolic pressure) of 120 mm Hg or higher — can damage blood vessels."
6b90e6cc,How can we reduce blood pressure without tablets?,"TOP 10 NATURAL WAYS TO CURE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE.
My name is Mildred Reyes. I would like to share some high blood pressure techniques from Jean Flores’s WordPress blog as followings. Jean Flores is a famous doctor.
BEST FOODS FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE RECOMMENDED BY HARVARD HEALTH:
1- Leafy greens
2- Berries
3- Red beets
4- Skim milk and yogurt
5- Oatmeal
6- Bananas
7- Salmon, mackerel, and fish with omega-3s
8- Seeds
9- Garlic and herbs
10- Dark chocolate
11- Pistachios
12- Olive oil
13- Pomegranates
Jean Flores also shares some useful tips below:
1. Walk and exercise regularly
As Jean Flores, Regular exercise helps make your heart stronger and more efficient at pumping blood, which lowers the pressure in your arteries. In fact, 150 minutes of moderate exercise, such as walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, such as running, per week can help lower blood pressure and improve your heart health. Useful source: Top 3 exercises to cure high
blood
pressure
2. Reduce your sodium intake
As Jean Flores, Salt intake is high around the world. In large part, this is due to processed and prepared foods. In many studies, salt has been linked to high blood pressure and heart events, like stroke. If you already have high blood pressure, it's worth cutting back your sodium intake to see if it makes a difference. Swap out processed foods with fresh ones and try seasoning with herbs and spices, rather than salt.
3. Drink less alcohol
As Jean Flores, Drinking alcohol can raise blood pressure. In fact, alcohol is linked to 16% of high blood pressure cases around the world.While some research has suggested that low-to-moderate amounts of alcohol may protect the heart, those benefits may be offset by negative effects.
4. Eat more potassium-rich foods
As Jean Flores, Potassium is an important mineral. It helps your body get rid of sodium and ease pressure on your blood vessels. To get a better balance of potassium to sodium in your diet, focus on eating fewer processed foods and more fresh, whole foods.
5. Cut back on caffeine
As Jean Flores, If you've ever downed a cup of coffee before you've had your blood pressure taken, you'll know that caffeine causes an instant boost. If you suspect you're caffeine-sensitive, cut back to see if it lowers your blood pressure (20Trusted Source).
6. Learn to manage stress
As Jean Flores, Stress is a key driver of high blood pressure. When you're chronically stressed, your body is in a constant fight-or-flight mode. On a physical level, that means a faster heart rate and constricted blood vessels. When you experience stress, you might also be more likely to engage in other behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or eating unhealthy food, that can negatively affect blood pressure.
7. Lose weight
As Jean Flores, If you're overweight, losing weight can make a big difference for your heart health. According to a 2016 study, losing 5% of your body mass could significantly lower high blood pressure. In previous studies, losing 17 pounds (7.7 kg) was linked to lowering systolic blood pressure by 8.5 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 6.5 mm Hg (28Trusted Source).
8. Try meditation or deep breathing
As Jean Flores, While these two behaviors could also fall under ""stress reduction techniques,"" meditation and deep breathing deserve specific mention. Both meditation and deep breathing are thought to activate the parasympathetic nervous system. This system is engaged when the body relaxes, slowing the heart rate and lowering blood pressure.
9. Cut added sugar and refined carbs
As Jean Flores, There's a growing body of research showing a link between added sugar and high blood pressure. In the Framingham Women's Health Study, women who drank even one soda per day had higher levels than those who drank less than one soda per day. Another study found that having one less sugar-sweetened beverage per day was linked to lower blood pressure.
10. Eat berries
As Jean Flores, Berries are full of more than just juicy flavor. They're also packed with polyphenols, natural plant compounds that are good for your heart. One small study had middle-aged people eat berries for eight weeks. Participants experienced improvements in different markers of heart health, including blood pressure.

32c1ee8b,Is stress the cause of high blood pressure?,"STRESS! A phenomenon that you suffer from during your daily hustle owing to a haphazard work-pressure, unbalanced schedule without any ME-time! Often, we want to take a break, we want to escape the exhaustion but there’s no beating that as you grow to take more responsibilities, both professionally and personally. Having said that, we are all aware of the impacts that stress has on us, including poor physical, mental and social health. Today, we shall primarily talk about stress and its consequences which include chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes. But first, let’s get to know the effects of stress on our health.
How Can Stress Affect Your Health?
Stress develops over time. Be it a haphazard schedule, over due work load or personal problems - anything that worries you, becomes a part of mental health and the same goes for your physical health when you are constantly hustling to make your mark. The cause can be whatever depending upon your lifestyle, but the impact remains grave.
Having a stressed schedule can deteriorate your mental health and can affect your hormonal balance. It can also promote high levels of cortisol which can affect your physical health as well. Poor mental health can affect your physical health as well and can lead to grave disorders for a lifetime including hypertension and diabetes as it affects your internal physique massively.
Is Hypertension A Consequence of Stress?
In the majority of cases, yes! Heavy stress can affect your hormones and can affect the blood circulation as it tampers with your heart rate and respiration rate. As a consequence, the blood pressure elevates and when it becomes a regular part of your life, it takes up the shape of chronic hypertension which in turn remains there for life. This condition is known as Hypertension where your body has high blood pressure throughout its blood vessels and should be regularly managed to avoid consequences like a cardiac attack and neuromuscular damage with stroke.
Can Ayurveda Help In Dealing With Stress and Hypertension?
Ayurveda, when taken as a lifestyle, can also help with precautions and is an ideal way to battle against diseases that originate from stress - be it physical or mental. Elements of ancient health including that of Panchkarma and DHyana can help you deal with physical and mental health respectively. A brief insight on your schedule with an organizational approach can also help you loads and as a result, you shall feel much relaxed than what you have felt in earlier times. Reducing stress can help you out in protecting yourself against these diseases as well. However, if you are already battling Hypertension, here are a few Ayurvedic remedies that can work wonders for you.
Hypertension can be easily managed with herbs like Shankhavali, Ashwagandha, and Khurasni. If you are looking forward to dealing with your mental stress, Shankhapushpi, and Brahmi are your go to herbs. However, these herbs only contribute to declining your stress levels in both aspects. In case you are having trouble managing your Hypertension or high blood pressure, it is ideal that you go for specifically curated Ayurvedic remedies Like Dr. Vaidya’s Unmadvati. Infused with herbs like Vekhand and Shatavari in addition to the above mentioned herbs, it helps in restoring your natural health while battling the consequences of hypertension."
762de527,What is the correlation of blood pressure to the pulse?,"Busting 4 Myths About Blood Pressure and Heart Rate
These 2 vital signs measure decidedly different health factors
Blood
pressure
and heart rate go hand in hand in most people’s minds. After all, these two vital signs
usually are measured at the same time at the doctor’s office.
But each measures distinctly different factors related to your heart health. Blood
pressure
is the force of blood flowing against the walls of your arteries, while heart rate — sometimes called pulse — is the number of times your heart beats every minute.
1. Blood pressure and heart rate are always linked
False: It is true that blood pressure and heart rate often rise and fall together, Dr. Laffin says. When you face danger, for example, your blood pressure and pulse may both jump upward at the same time. However, if your heart rate rises, that doesn’t automatically mean your blood pressure will rise — or vice versa.
“When the two are disconnected, you may be looking at a specific problem,” “For example, if you are dehydrated, bleeding or have a severe infection, blood pressure typically decreases and heart rate increases.”
2. Blood pressure and heart rate have “normal” target numbers
False: There are guidelines
, but what’s normal varies from person to person.
Optimal blood pressure typically is defined as 120 mm Hg systolic — which is the pressure as your heart beats — over 80 mm Hg diastolic — which is the pressure as your heart relaxes. For your resting heart rate, the target is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (BPM).
3. A low pulse or blood pressure always indicates a problem
False: What’s healthy for one person may indicate danger for another. For example, a fit person may have a resting heart rate in their 50s or, in some cases, even their 40s. “It can actually be a sign of being in really good shape,”
Low
blood
pressure
can be a bit trickier, especially in older patients and those with heart disease. If you’re in danger from low blood pressure, your body will tell you that you are weak.
4. High blood pressure is more dangerous than a high heart rate
True: Again, what’s considered normal varies. But doctors say there is enough clinical evidence to suggest that when blood pressure is even a little over your typical average over time, the risk for heart disease and stroke go up. The physical effects of high blood pressure take their toll on your blood vessels.
“Essentially, for each increment of 20 mmHg over 115 mmHg systolic, your risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure or chronic kidney disease doubles,”
Elevated heart rate can be a sign of danger, too, but the cause-effect relationship is not so clear.

it started to go to 140/90…after a month and then 130 /90 going when i approach two months of diet, exercise and magnesium..
now it is 120/80 after more than two months"
3de932a6,What are the symptoms of high-blood pressure ?,"Most people with high blood pressure have no symptoms at all, that's why it's called the silent killer, since in the long run it can damage your heart, kidneys, brain, eyes, causing heart attacks, heart failure, strokes, even blindness.
Only in very severe high blood pressure (Hypertensive emergency
) causing your brain to swell it can cause headache, nausea, confusion, paresthesia (Hypertensive encephalopathy
), and if the eyes are severely damaged you get vision problems (Hypertensive retinopathy
)
So only by measuring correctly you will know your blood pressure.
Measuring blood pressure is another problem, many people who on one occasion had too high a blood pressure didn't have it when blood pressure was taken at a later moment, we call it White coat hypertension
. In the large Australian therapeutic trial in mild hypertension study published in The Lancet on 14 June 1980 they found that even after 3 measurements of too high a blood pressure 504 (12,8%) of the in total 3932 participants had a blood pressure below the inclusion range at the 4th, 5th etc. measurement so weren't that hypertensive at all. So before treating high blood pressure just make sure it really is too high.
Usually the first measurement is falsely high, we repeat measuring blood pressure until we have two measurements within 5% of each other, the mean of which we consider the right measurement.
You can help your doc by measuring your own blood pressure at home using a validated blood pressure monitor, following the recommendation above, and writing the measurements down.
Here you find a validated list (in green) of blood pressure monitors:
dabl Educational Trust|Monitors for Self-measurement of
Blood
Pressure
(SBPM)

I would go for an upper arm blood pressure monitor. They costs around US$ 100,- Don't just buy a cheap one, because they aren't reliable so are no good.
By now we have scientifically proven non pharmacological means to treat high blood pressure, being:
loosing weight (most important)
3-4 times a week 30-60 minutes of (aerobic and isometric) exercises
relaxation exercises
less than 1 alcoholic drink a day
avoid salt in the food (unfortunately not all hypertensives are salt sensitive, so works only FOR some) strive for 2 to max 6 grams of salt a day in your food
don't smoke: smoking will damage your cardiovascular system more than the protection you gain from anti-hypertensive therapy.
some research is being done on supplementing potassium, calcium, omega 3 fatty acids, low fat diets etc.

Are you sure the values you have taken are reliable? The first step is look at what monitor you use, a validated one (list to be found on dabl Educational Trust|Monitors for Self-measurement of
Blood
Pressure
(SBPM)
) I hope, otherwise all values measured are of no value and of no consequence at all, throw the unvalidated monitor out and get yourself a validated one. Then is how do you measure your blood pressure? You need to sit with your blood pressure cuff (if you have a thicker arm it needs a larger cuff)
held at heart's height
measure your blood pressure, discard the first measurement, repeat at least twice with 1 to 2 minute intervals, stop when you find two values within 5% of one another, the mean of those you may consider to be your true blood pressure value of the moment.
Blood pressure will vary over the time of the day (diurnal rhythm) the highest after your body has been ""started"" (waking up) early in the morning

705ef2db,How long can one live with high blood pressure?,"Question asked:
Can you live with high blood pressure?
Many people live with high blood pressure and don’t really even notice any symptoms of it. The problem is that over time uncontrolled high BP causes damage to the body and will almost certainly shorten your life. It can often be controlled without meds but it’s not easy to do. Exercise and changing what you eat can do the trick but if not there are prescription meds that can do it. The important thing is to get it under control as soon as possible to stop the damage it’s silently doing to your body."
25b9add5,What is a normal blood pressure for someone over 70?,"When it comes to treating blood pressure, “normal for age” and “average” are not useful concepts. If high blood pressure was typical for your age group, and you could add 5 years to your life expectancy with cheap pills that lower blood pressure, would you forgo treatment just because you were average or “normal”?
Higher levels of blood pressure are dangerous at ANY age for simple physical reasons—pressure puts a damaging physical strain on your arteries and organs. (In fact, higher pressures are probably more dangerous as you get older and your arteries and organs become less resilient.)
Cardiovascular (heart attack and stroke) risk starts to rise log-linearly above about 115 mm/Hg systolic. (Log-linearly means that the risk grows more and more quickly as systolic BP moves up from 115.)
There is debate about the blood pressure level at which treatment other than diet-and-exercise should be started. It depends on one’s personal situation. The most recent US guidelines define a systolic (the upper-number) BP of 119 or less as “normal,” regardless of age. By “normal,” they really mean “safe.”
120 to 129 is termed “elevated.” 130–139 is called Stage 1 Hypertension (High Blood Pressure).
The old treatment threshold used to be 140 systolic, and perhaps 130 if diabetes is present. The recent SPRINT study showed that treating to below 120 reduces mortality and cardiovascular event rates by 25 and 27%, respectively, in persons with at least one other cardiovascular risk factor."
1128319f,What drink can lower the blood pressure immediately?,"The following drinks are proven to help BP (if Diet is your cause rather than Stress, weight, sleep etc)
Coconut water - Rich is Potassium
Hibiscus Tea - Rich in antioxidants
Matcha Tea - same as above
Green Tea - same as above (i have listed the tea in order of the highest antioxidant so the best)
Montmorency Cherry Juice
Beetroot Juice - high in Nitrates
Apple Cider vinegar
Pomegranate Juice
One of the frustrations people have is they try various food, drinks are and some seem to work and some dont. The reason being is until you have found your actual root cause - Diet, Exercise (lack), Stress, Relaxation, sleep, sun exposure (lack) or weight you are just making guesses at what may help.
Find your personal cause and then deal with it direct, its easier, less frustrating and in the long run healthier!

634a6b47,Why can high blood pressure lead to kidney failure?,"My name is Andrea Watson. Hi friends, let me show some high blood pressure techniques from Tracy Hughes’s WordPress blog: Top 8 tips that can help to lower your high blood pressure in just 9 mins. Tracy Hughes is a famous blogger about blood pressure.
Tracy Hughes’s Tip 1: Lose weight. Being overweight means that your heart has to pump blood to a larger body mass, which makes the heart work harder. Losing weight reduces the workload. “Plus, your heart will be better able to respond to circumstances that do require more work, like exercise,” says Dr. Zusman.
Tracy Hughes’s Tip 2: Exercise. Any activity that gets your heart pumping faster and your lungs working harder is one of the best ways to lower high blood pressure. “It improves the blood vessels’ ability to open and close, which improves blood flow,” says Dr. Zusman. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.
Tracy Hughes’s Tip 3: Reduce your stress. Chronic stress may contribute to high blood pressure. More research is needed to determine the effects of chronic stress on blood pressure. Occasional stress also can contribute to high blood pressure if you react to stress by eating unhealthy food, drinking alcohol or smoking.
Tracy Hughes’s Tip 4: Reduce sodium in your diet
Tracy Hughes’s Tip 5: Control underlying conditions.
Tracy Hughes’s Tip 6: Stop caffeine.
Tracy Hughes’s Tip 7: Limit alcohol intake.
Tracy Hughes’s Tip 8: Stop smoking.

Yes, it can, although not as bad as naproxen, indomethacin and piroxicam see NSAIDs and increased blood pressure. What is the clinical significance? mean blood pressure increase on an NSAID is 3/2 mm. Hg (systolic/diastolic blood pressure). A discussion from 2016 on Medscape (behind a paywall) NSAIDs, Coxibs, and Cardio-Renal Physiology: A Mechanism-Based Evaluation: Coxibs and Hypertension Medscape Log In says. The potential mechanisms for increased BP related to therapy with NSAIDs include effects on both blood volume and peripheral resistance. As discussed, inhibition of renal PG synthesis can lead to sodium and water retention, potentially increasing plasma volume. In addition, prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator, and inhibition of its synthesis under certain conditions may increase peripheral resistance. So, in short, by blocking cyclooxygenase 2 it causes salt and water retention, intravascular volume expansion, and most likely elevating peripheral vascular resistance too."

I am Dana Salazar. I would like to share some high blood pressure methods from Nora Santiago’s Twitter as follows. Nora Santiago is a famous doctor in Lexington hospital, USA.
1- Change your diet: According to Nora Santiago’s advice, There is good evidence plant-based diets high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes will lead to lower weight loss and blood pressure up to 14mmhg.
Best foods for high blood pressure:
-Red beets
-Skim milk and yogurt
-Oatmealf
-Bananas
-Salmon, mackerel, and fish with omega-3s
-Seeds
-Garlic and herbs
-Dark chocolate
-Pistachios
-Olive oil
-Pomegranates
-Leafy greens
-Berries
2- Eat less.
As Nora Santiago, Up to a certain point, getting thinner will reduce your blood pressure. Bigger mass = bigger body to pump things through = higher blood pressure.
3- Lower your stress level:
As Nora Santiago, stress is a result of the never-ending daily chores so, it's so important that you get some time off and reduce your stress. MeditationSecretsAZ is a good site to learn medation and eiminate your stress.
4- Walk and exercise regularly:
As Nora Santiago, it's a good idea to exercise for at least 20 minutes in the morning on a regular basis then this can bring the reading down by up to 9 mmHg.
5- Taichi
As Nora Santiago, taichi also is one of the best way to lower your high blood pressure. TaichiA2Z is the best site to learn Yang taichi or Wudang tai chi.
6- Change your life style:
As Nora Santiago, you should: do not work overtime, do not smoke, do not sleep late, sleep more, quit smoking.
7- Yoga
As Nora Santiago, yoga is one of the best way to lower your high blood pressure. YogaHandbook365 is a good site to learn many styles of yoga.

27546fb4,Why does blood pressure become higher in old age?,"Blood pressure usually become higher in old ages... This happens because..
According to some study this is found that the blood vessels of human beings in their old ages start losing yellow fibers i.e. elastin fibers from them which results in losing the capacity to dilates and become more stiff and results in higher blood pressure ...
Moreover in old ages more amount of cholesterol and other fats starts depositing in the lumen of blood vessels which results in narrow lumen and responsible for higher blood pressure...

But you didn't say the age. That systolic pressure is at the brink of abnormally high (95th percentile) for an 11-year old of average height. For a shorter 11-year-old or for a younger child, it would be greater than the 95th percentile.
You also didn't say the circumstance. Humans maintain a satisfactory blood pressure (even when dehydrated or bleeding) until they reach a point of collapse. The term for this is ""compensated shock"". So even if the blood pressure is the same number as a healthy normal person, it would not be normal if they were pale, clammy and light-headed."

Often the level of starches/carbs is based on someone's goals and activity levels. Higher levels of activity = higher carb intake. Sweet potatoes and white rice are usually the go-tos but white potatoes have their place as well. Additionally there is evidence that white potatoes in the form of resistant starch

As for red meat causing diseases (as many others have pointed out) this is nonsense. Don't determine your diet by what the headlines say is the latest superfood or what food is going to kill you. Its bullshit. Do your homework.
The paleo diet has never been about re-enactment, its a framework for living an optimal life based on human appropriate food, movement, sleep, etc. Over the past few years, the ""paleo diet"" has evolved to be more about real, whole foods than the previous strict dogma.

Maybe a video OR photos of dog can help others understand/visualize your dogs innocent “aggressive-single-bark” that probably wasn't even directed at the other dog to begin with..
IF your dog was determined “aggressive” have a vet check him/her ASAP. Often infections may cause aggressive type behaviors and hopefully if you cure the cause it will resolve issue.

1b4f1166,Is red cell dist.width (in a blood test of CBC) can be considered as an indicator to stroke?,"In response to your excellent question, there appears to be some interesting data that tends to support this concept. By definition,, the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is an employed parameter that represents the differentiation of red blood cell volume and size. (microcytic, macrocytic and normocytic). Results of the test, along with those of other blood tests, can help doctors to confirm the presence of certain anemias, a condition characterized by a lack of red blood cells. The RDW test can additionally determine, in many cases, the underlying source of the anemia. To cite one example, in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, which is differentiated from folate deficiency, an RDW can be revealing. RDW would increase due to the release of immature RBCs in certain blood diseases. RDW tends to increase in iron deficiency anemia, as mean corpuscular volume (MCV) decreases. MCV is the average volume of a red blood cell. However, there is more to this research narrative.-
It has been claimed with some compelling evidence, though not thoroughly conclusive, that RDW had an interesting association to mortality prediction and cardiovascular episodes, such as acute coronary syndromes, ischemic strokes, peripheral arterial disease and hypertension. It is also believed that RDW can be a predictor of mortality in some patients with cancer, renal failure and lung disease. Cerebral infarction (CI) (ischemic stroke, 70% of all strokes)), with cerebral thrombosis, lacunar infarction, cerebral embolism are caused by a brain blood supply disorder of brain lesions. -It should be kept in mind though, that, there is really no direct biological marker to diagnose stroke. RDW might be an available alternative that can narrow the gap.-
In a more direct response to your curious question, current studies confirm that RDW is narrowly related to the occurrence of ischemic strokes. It has been observed that the levels of RDW in these stroke patients was higher than in those without occurring strokes. It is tempting and even logical to assume that RDW assessment plays a principle role in stroke progression, -
Another obvious question is how is RDW related to these mechanisms, and what exactly is causing these changes? The RDW biological mechanism between ischemic strokes and RDW is still a bit vague. There are many unanswered questions. Inflammation and oxidative stress (imbalance between the cell and its ability to rid itself of toxic metabolites), may play an important part in this dilemma. Inflammation lessens the survival ability of RBCs and causes cellular damage. Other studies say that RDW was associated with tumor necrosis factor receptors or C reactive proteins, and other inflammatory mediators, which are all inflammation markers.-
In conclusion, though, RDW thinly appears to be a predictor for mortality and ischemic stroke risk, though its mechanisms remain unclear. Inflammation as well appears to be a respected player in this pathological equation. Many of these research findings originate from a mixture number of independent studies (meta analyses). There is no doubt, that regarding this topic, we have glimpsed only the tip of the iceberg. WE must, and should consider the importance and relevance of all the other findings and observations before rushing to half baked conclusions. Let us continue to research, learn and properly heal, whenever we can.-"

cb0ef78b,"In a death tournament with Batman’s death stroke, Damien Wayne, Robin, Red Hood, Red Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Batwoman, Heretic Raes al Ghoul, Lady Shiva and Bronze Tiger, how would it go and who will win?","I don’t really understand the “Batman’s death stroke” and “Heretic Raes al Ghoul”, I am not doing to include Batman but I will do Deathstroke and I will include both Heretic and Ra’s al Ghul. I am doing to use Damian Wayne as Robin because in my eyes, I only really see four Robins and three is already on this list. I don’t know who is the Batgirl but I will use Barbara Gordon, just because reasons.
So Deathstroke vs Damian Wayne vs Red Hood vs Red Robin vs Nightwing vs Batgirl vs Batwoman, Heretic and Ra’s al Ghul, Lady Shiva and Bronze Tiger.
So first thing first I will take Batgirl out, just because I believe Deathstroke, Bronze Tiger, Lady Shiva, Red Hood, Nightwing, Red Robin and Heretic can take her out. And while she is highly intelligent, when you are in a death tournament, you can’t just sit down a plan. Damian Wayne probaby can’t defeat her but he does have a chance as he is train from both. I believe Red Robin can defeat her because he started his train when he was way younger. Batwoman could “defeat” as she have done so in Batgirl Vol 4 12.
Next Batwoman will go down, just because usually her advantage is that she kills but now they are in a death tournament so she no longer gets this. Deathstroke, Red Hood, Nightwing, Heretic, Ra’s al Ghul, Lady Shiva and Bronze Tiger. Damian will have difficult with her but I do believe he can win as he is trained young and have is suppose to be “perfect”. I see Red Robin being smarter and will think of a way out of this.
Then I would say Damian Wayne is down, just because he is not as skilled and some more. He can be defeated by Deathstroke, When ever Robin is fighting Red Hood, Jason is not even looking for a fight, but one of a “out fight”, Red Hood wins. In Teen Titans Annual Vol 6 1
And this is what happen when Red Robin goes “all out” in Red Robin Vol 1 14
And forget when the New 52 movies say, Nightwing can beat Damian even without trying. In Batman Vol 1 688
In Batman Incorporated Vol 2 8, Heretic can defeat Damian
I can see Ra's al Ghul, Lady Shiva and Bronze Tiger beating Damian in a a death tournament.
For a refresh, now there is Deathstroke, Red Hood, Red Robin, Nightwing, Heretic, Ra’s al Ghul, Lady Shiva, and Bronze Tiger left standing.
When all of them, Heretic can go now. I believe that Deathstroke, Ra’s al Ghul, Lady Shiva, and Bronze Tiger defeat. As Deathstroke can fight a god, Ra’s have been around for a long time, Lady Shiva is the best of the best and Bronze Tiger is also good. While Damian might fail against in Batman Incorporated Vol 2 8
I believe Red Hood, Red Robin and Nightwing is better than Damain Wayne.
I would say Bronze Tiger goes out next. Deathstroke can take him, even though Bronze Tiger is more skilled, Slade has his ability and can use 90% of his brain. I also don’t really count Deathstroke the Hunted Vol 1 41 but if you do, good for you.
I can see Jason beating Ben. Just cause Red Hood is more violent, in a way, and Red Hood is also very skilled as he is train by Batman, Nightwing, Bronze Tiger, Lady Shiva and the All-Caste. I believe he is smarter than Been. In Outlaws Vol 1 26, they did fight but it is good to keep in mind that in that issue Red Hood is not at his peak.
Red Robin while may not be more skill, he is smarter in many ways. Bronze Tiger can be probably be defeated by Nightwing with difficulty. In Grayson Vol 1 18
While Bronze Tiger is good, Ra’s al Ghul have been around for a long time. and Bronze Tiger have said that Lady Shiva is better than him. In Batgirl Vol 1 67.
Not Ben is not to be taken lightly as he is very skill with Chi Manipulation.
I will have to say that Red Robin have to go now. While, he is great at thinking and fighting, he might not be able to live though this death tournament. Deathstroke already can defeat him in Teen Titans Vol 3 4
Red Hood already fight Tim and win a few times before and one of those times is in Teen Titans Vol 3 29
Nightwing will be able to beat Tim Drake, and they did fight in Nightwing Vol 2 139. It should be said that they both (Tim more) are not in the best of place. But you can see that Nightwing is not looking for a fight and is winning.
While, Red Robin can out smart Ra’s, he did it with planing but with the same reason as Barbara, he can’t just think. And Ra’s should be skilled enough to defeat Tim. In Red Robin Issue 12
While Red Robin did win aganist Lady Shiva
But if you think about Lady Shiva is not stupid and she won’t be falling for tricks, that is if Tim have time to plan against her with so many people.
Lady Shiva is good but I believe it is time for her to go. While she is good, Deathstroke has enhanced everything. And don’t believe the movie, Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons
In Outlaws Vol 1 26, Jason was was able to fight against Lady Shiva
And while in Nightwing Vol 3 14, Lady Shiva did win, Nightwing was already injure before the fight, on top of that Nightwing did not even really use any of his weapons, besides the Escrima Sticks and two of his wingdings.
But Nightwing can land attack her still even if Lady Shiva can read his body language. Nightwing is suppose to be a unpredictable fighter and that’s what help him survive against Midnighter in Grayson Vol 1 6
Ra’s al Ghul have been around this earth the longest of everyone here. He have the most experience, he also have the Lazarus Enhancement, which help a lot in places like his strength, speed, stamina, agility, and durability. He can take on Batman, something Lady Shiva can’t really do.
The next person I will dismiss will be Ra’s al Ghul. Deasthstroke is better but not by a lot, while Ra’s al Ghul is the better fighter. In Deathstroke Vol 3 20, Deathstroke did seems like losing but I don’t believe he was in the right mind
So Ra’s al Ghul have a pretty big chance of winning but I am pretty sure that Deathstroke is stronger, faster, and smarter.
Red Hood have defeat Ra’s al Ghul before in Outlaws Vol 1 27
Nightwing have defeated him in Nightwing Vol 2 152
So now down to three; Deathstroke vs Red Hood vs Nightwing.
Nightwing will now met his death because when you can comparing Deathstroke, Red Hood and Nightwing and ask who is the worst at killing, the answer will be Nightwing. While usauuly in a Nightwing vs Red Hood fight, I would back up Nightwing but this is a death tournament we are talking about. But in a in character fight, I would say Nightwing as he usually wins. In Batman: Battle for the Cowl Vol 1 3
And when Nightwing goes against Deathstroke, it doesn’t usually go that well for Dick. In New Titans Vol 1 86
Going down to Red Hood and Deathstroke, the winner will be Deathstroke. While Jason is able to “defeat” Slade in Deathstroke Vol 3 16, he was already injure before the fight and in the fight Deathstroke did put up a really great fight.

f052a9be,"Why does hormone replacement therapy raise your hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell counts, putting you at risk for stroke and heart attacks?",Testosterone is believed to stimulate the production of erythropoietin which is a hormone that stimulates RBC production. Testosterone may also increase the number of erythropoietin receptors in bone marrow.

1c325f94,"Why does my red blood cell, hematocrit, and hemoglobin counts remain very high putting me at risk for heart attacks and strokes? How can I reduce the numbers?","What is being described here is erythrocytosis. Before embarking on any work-up, I would review other laboratory chemistries with an eye toward determining if this result was artifactual as a result of dehydration. If so, the recommendation would be to drink more water, unless there are heart or kidney problems for which this recommendation would not apply.
Sometimes, what a patient believes is “very high” isn’t; without knowing what the entire CBC results are, this possible issue cannot be fully discerned.
What follows is a list of possible causes of erythrocytosis. This is a partial list as I am sure there may be something I am overlooking, but at least this is a beginning from which a possible answer may come.
I. Erythrocytosis associated with a normal or reduced red cell mass (spurious)
Acute or chronic hemoconcentration (relative)
Spurious polycythemia (also called stress polycythemia or Gaisböck’s syndrome)
II. Erythrocytosis associated with an elevated red cell mass (absolute polycythemia)
Polycythemia vera
Secondary polycythemia (increased erythropoietin production)
1. Systemic hypoxia
a. high altitude
b. cardiac disease with right-to-left shunt
c. chronic pulmonary disease
2. Decreased blood oxygen-carrying capacity, increase in carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin (smoking)
3. Impaired oxygen delivery, hemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity or congenital decreased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate
4. Local hypoxia — renal artery stenosis
5. Autonomous erythropoietin production
a. Tumors: hypernephroma, cerebellar hemangioblastoma, hepatoma, uterine fibroids, pheochromocytoma, adrenal cortical adenoma, ovarian carcinoma
b. Renal disorders: cysts, hydronephrosis, Bartter’s syndrome, postrenal transplantation, renal artery stenosis, focal sclerosing or membranous glomerulonephritis
6. Familial polycythemia due to autonomous erythropoietin production
Erythropoietin receptor mutations
VHL mutations (Chuvash polycythemia)
2,3-BPG mutation
PHD2 and HIF2α mutations
The use of anabolic steroids or recombinant erythropoietin; high oxygen affinity hemoglobins; sleep apnea syndrome; and hepatopulmonary syndrome are also possible.
If the diagnosis of polycythemia is established, it is an indolent disease with a median survival of over 15 years. The major cause of morbidity and mortality is arterial thrombosis. Over time, polycythemia vera may convert to myelofibrosis or to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In approximately 5% of cases, the disorder progresses to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which is usually refractory to therapy. It should, therefore, be apparent that anyone with a diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) should be referred to a hematologist.

I am Carla Pierce. I want to share some high blood pressure experience from Jean Flores’s blog as follows. Jean Flores is a famous doctor in Baltimore hospital, USA.
1- Change your diet: According to Jean Flores’s advice, There is good evidence plant-based diets high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes will lead to lower weight loss and blood pressure up to 14mmhg.
Best foods for high blood pressure:
-Red beets
-Skim milk and yogurt
-Oatmealf
-Bananas
-Salmon, mackerel, and fish with omega-3s
-Seeds
-Garlic and herbs
-Dark chocolate
-Pistachios
-Olive oil
-Pomegranates
-Leafy greens
-Berries
2- Eat less.
As Jean Flores, Up to a certain point, getting thinner will reduce your blood pressure. Bigger mass = bigger body to pump things through = higher blood pressure.
3- Lower your stress level:
As Jean Flores, stress is a result of the never-ending daily chores so, it's so important that you get some time off and reduce your stress. MeditationSecretsAZ is a good site to learn medation and eiminate your stress.
4- Walk and exercise regularly:
As Jean Flores, it's a good idea to exercise for at least 20 minutes in the morning on a regular basis then this can bring the reading down by up to 9 mmHg.
5- Taichi
As Jean Flores, taichi also is one of the best way to lower your high blood pressure. TaichiA2Z is the best site to learn Yang taichi or Wudang tai chi.
6- Change your life style:
As Jean Flores, you should: do not work overtime, do not smoke, do not sleep late, sleep more, quit smoking.
7- Yoga
As Jean Flores, yoga is one of the best way to lower your high blood pressure. YogaHandbook365 is a good site to learn many styles of yoga.

I am Nancy Lopez. I want to share some high blood pressure methods from Nicole Roberts’s Twitter in the following. Nicole Roberts is a famous doctor in Miami
1- Exercise regularly. According to Nicole Roberts’s advice, Regular exercise helps make your heart stronger and more efficient at pumping blood, which lowers the pressure in your arteries. In fact, 150 minutes of moderate exercise, such as walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, such as running, per week can help lower blood pressure and improve your heart health.
Some exercises for high blood pressure:
+ Go for a Swim.
+ Take a Walk.
+ Ride a Bike.
+ Hit the Gym.
+ Yoga
Useful post: Best 3 exercises to cure
high
blood
pressure in 9 minutes
2- Reduce your sodium intake.
As Nicole Roberts, Salt intake is high around the world. In large part, this is due to processed and prepared foods. In many studies, salt has been linked to high blood pressure and heart events, like stroke. If you already have high blood pressure, it's worth cutting back your sodium intake to see if it makes a difference. Swap out processed foods with fresh ones and try seasoning with herbs and spices, rather than salt.
3- Drink less alcohol.
As Nicole Roberts, Drinking alcohol can raise blood pressure. In fact, alcohol is linked to 16% of high blood pressure cases around the world.While some research has suggested that low-to-moderate amounts of alcohol may protect the heart, those benefits may be offset by negative effects.
4- Eat more potassium-rich foods.
As Nicole Roberts, As Judy Gomez, Potassium is an important mineral. It helps your body get rid of sodium and ease pressure on your blood vessels. To get a better balance of potassium to sodium in your diet, focus on eating fewer processed foods and more fresh, whole foods.
5- Cut back on caffeine.
As Nicole Roberts, If you've ever downed a cup of coffee before you've had your blood pressure taken, you'll know that caffeine causes an instant boost. If you suspect you're caffeine-sensitive, cut back to see if it lowers your blood pressure.
6- Learn to manage stress.
As Nicole Roberts, Stress is a key driver of high blood pressure. When you're chronically stressed, your body is in a constant fight-or-flight mode. On a physical level, that means a faster heart rate and constricted blood vessels. When you experience stress, you might also be more likely to engage in other behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or eating unhealthy food, that can negatively affect blood pressure. MediationWayAZ is the best site to learn how to stop stress and learn mediation.
7- Lose weight.
As Nicole Roberts, If you're overweight, losing weight can make a big difference for your heart health. According to a 2016 study, losing 5% of your body mass could significantly lower high blood pressure. In previous studies, losing 17 pounds (7.7 kg) was linked to lowering systolic blood pressure by 8.5 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 6.5 mm Hg.
8- Try meditation or deep breathing.
As Nicole Roberts, While these two behaviors could also fall under ""stress reduction techniques,"" meditation and deep breathing deserve specific mention. Both meditation and deep breathing are thought to activate the parasympathetic nervous system. This system is engaged when the body relaxes, slowing the heart rate and lowering blood pressure.
9- Cut added sugar and refined carbs.
As Nicole Roberts, There's a growing body of research showing a link between added sugar and high blood pressure. In the Framingham Women's Health Study, women who drank even one soda per day had higher levels than those who drank less than one soda per day. Another study found that having one less sugar-sweetened beverage per day was linked to lower blood pressure.
10- Eat berries.
As Nicole Roberts, Berries are full of more than just juicy flavor. They're also packed with polyphenols, natural plant compounds that are good for your heart. One small study had middle-aged people eat berries for eight weeks. Participants experienced improvements in different markers of heart health, including blood pressure.

7547aadc,What foods cause high blood pressure and/or what foods help reduce high blood pressure?,"What is high blood pressure?
Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls. The heart pumps blood into the arteries (blood vessels) which carry the blood throughout the body. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, means the pressure in your arteries is above the normal range. In most cases, no one knows what causes high blood pressure. What you eat can affect your blood pressure.
How does nutrition affect blood pressure?
Certain foods can increase blood pressure.
Certain foods can lower blood pressure.
Gaining weight can increase blood pressure.
Losing weight can reduce blood pressure.
What should I eat to control high blood pressure?
Eat foods lower in fat, salt, and calories.
Use spices and herbs, vinegar, lemon or fruit juices instead of salt to flavour foods.
Use less oil, butter, margarine, shortening, and salad dressings.
What are some of the foods I should eat?
Skim or 1% milk, yoghurt, Greek yoghurt (calcium-rich foods can lower blood pressure).
Lean meat.
Skinless turkey and chicken.
Low-salt, ready-to-eat cereals.
Cooked hot cereal (not instant).
Low-fat and low-salt cheeses.
Fruits (fresh, frozen, or canned without added salt).
Vegetables (fresh, frozen or canned, no added salt).Richly coloured green, orange, and red items are high in potassium and minerals that help lower blood pressure.The goal is 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables per day.
Plain rice, pasta, and potatoes.
Bread (English muffins, bagels, rolls, and tortillas).
Lower salt ""prepared"" convenience food.
Unsalted seeds (pumpkin, squash, sunflower) and unsalted nuts are mineral-rich foods that lower blood pressure.

What foods should I eat less of?
Butter and margarine.
Regular salad dressings.
Fatty Meats.
Whole milk dairy products.
Fried foods.
Salted snacks.
Canned soups.
Fast foods.

What's the difference between sodium and salt?
Salt is mostly sodium, a mineral that occurs naturally in foods. Sodium is the substance that may cause your blood pressure to increase. Other forms of sodium are also present in food. MSG (monosodium glutamate) is another example of a sodium added to food (common in Chinese food).
How does salt increase blood pressure?
When you eat too much salt, which contains sodium, your body holds extra water to ""wash"" the salt from your body. In some people, this may cause blood pressure to rise. The added water puts stress on your heart and blood vessels.
How much sodium is too much?
The American Heart Association recommends limiting daily sodium intake no more than 1,500 milligrams. (A teaspoon of salt has about 2,400 milligrams of sodium.) Most people greatly exceed these sodium guidelines.
How can I reduce my sodium intake?
Don't use table salt.
Read nutrition labels and choose foods lower in sodium.
Choose foods marked ""sodium-free,"" ""low sodium,"" and ""unsalted.""
Use salt substitutes (ask your healthcare provider first).
Don't use lite salt as a substitute.
Read content labels. (Contents are listed in order of greatest amount.)
Purchase sodium-free herbs and seasoning mix like Mrs Dash®.
What foods are high in sodium?
Processed foods such as lunch meats, sausage, bacon, and ham.
Canned soups, bouillon, dried soup mixes.
Deli meats.
Condiments (catsup, soy sauce, salad dressings).
Frozen and boxed mixes for potatoes, rice, and pasta.
Snack foods (pretzels, popcorn, peanuts, chips).
Pickled or marinated food in brine. (Vinegar- and lemon juice-based marinades are ok.)
What else should I do to change my diet?
Avoid alcohol.
Eat a variety of foods.
Eat foods high in dietary fibre (whole grain bread, cereals, pasta, fresh fruit, and vegetables).

cfaf7963,How do you know if your blood pressures high?,
33595bd1,Which herbs or vitamins are good to eliminate high blood pressure?,"High blood pressure needs immediate precautions to bring it down. You can easily miss its initial symptoms till it gets too late to make amends. Which is why, Ayurveda recommends to follow a controlled diet and lifestyle that can keep a check on your blood pressure throughout the day. As per Ayurveda, following dincarya (daily regime) and ritucarya (seasonal regime) is essential to oversee hypertension. So, here are some eating habits you can adopt in your every day life for controlling BP efficiently:
Avoid spicy, sour and salty foods like chillies, ready-to-eat preparations and refined flour products. Take your meals on time and avoid binge eating after sunset.
Add nourishing foods like green gram, wheat, carrot, flax seeds, sesame seeds, pomegranate, Amla, beetroot, red cabbage, garlic, ghee and milk to your daily diet.
Make it a habit to consume supper early in the evening. Incorporate sweet, astringent and bitter food sources in it as they reduce blood toxicity.
Further, you can top up your diet with some Ayurvedic herbs like Punarnava, Ginger etc. that can lower the blood pressure and prevent its complications. Here are some easy remedies for doing so:
Drink dry ginger herbal tea in the morning hours, if your high blood pressure is triggered by consuming untimely meals or refrigerated food.
Consume Amalaki or Gokshura powder/tablets every day, if you are exceedingly indulgent in junk food.
Hypertension caused by stress, anxiety or intake of alcohol/acidic food can be curbed with Arjuna and Shatavari.
For prolonged complaint of hypertension, drink Moringa leaf juice with honey regularly. Make sure to consult your physician for getting your dosage guidelines
Boil some Garlic cloves in milk and drink it with honey. It is a sureshot remedy for controlling high blood pressure.
If you find these remedies too hassling, you can also try Nirogam’s Hypershun
tablets. It is composed of Giloy, Ashwagandha, Mandukaparni, Vacha, Mandukpishti, Praval pishti and many more BP-regulating herbs that nourish the kidney, spleen and intestine tissues, while lowering your average blood pressure readings.
Hope this helps you to manage your BP problems better!"

7f1af3f3,"Can high blood pressure be cured? If not, how can one control it?","There are two type of hypertension.
1 Primary
2 Secondary
Primary is not due to any other disease.
Causes includes stress, sedentary life style, and mostly genetic.
Two types of primary hypertension, benign and malignant. Benign is easy to treat since bp won't be very high as in malignant, leads to disease after very long time.
Malignant is more dangerous, where blood pressure stays very high like 200/120, 230/140 and some time as less as 160/100. It's generally difficult to treat. All end Organ damage will manifest within 5 years if bp is not controlled adequately.
Secondary hypertension is due to any abnormal changes or disease of the organs such as kidney, nervous system or blood vessel, increased amount of thyroid hormone in the blood, etc.
Okay, first no cure.
Can be controlled and bp may become normal.
Natural:
Excercise regularly.
Aerobic
Cycling and/or jogging
Yoga and meditation
DASH diet
Salt restriction (<2gms of sodium/day)
Fruits/veg (adequate Potassium and magnesium)
- this is N/A for patients with end
stage kidney failure
Decrease dietary fat intake
Increased dietary fibre intake
Fluid restriction (only for patients with end stage kidney failure)
Others drink adequate amount of water
Stay stress free.
Stop smoking.
Try to avoid/Reduce coffee consumption
Try to avoid/Reduce alcohol consumption to (<20ml/day)
Bp will be maintained very well in most casses by the above methods.
Medications:
Anti hypertensive drugs
Such as depin, clonidepin, ramipril, enalopril, lisindopril, thiazides etc..
Along with drugs to decrease the blood pressure Drugs to control the disease that causes hypertension is also given in patients with secondary hypertension.
Please follow your docs prescription for drugs, taking medications that is meant to decrease your bp may decrease it too low if taken at high dosages/multiple drugs at a time. They have various unwanted side effects also. Hence not to be taken without consultation.
Natural ways are applicable for most people with hypertension, and are almost always safe. May not be easy to follow all, may not be easy to practice regularly. May not be effective if bp is very high due to secondary cause for example a condition called renal artery stenosis (where artery of kidney becomes narrow), where a drug or intervention by a professional is compulsory."

ec053a06,What are the symptoms of high-blood pressure ?,"Most people with high blood pressure have no symptoms at all, that's why it's called the silent killer, since in the long run it can damage your heart, kidneys, brain, eyes, causing heart attacks, heart failure, strokes, even blindness.
Only in very severe high blood pressure (Hypertensive emergency
) causing your brain to swell it can cause headache, nausea, confusion, paresthesia (Hypertensive encephalopathy
), and if the eyes are severely damaged you get vision problems (Hypertensive retinopathy
)
So only by measuring correctly you will know your blood pressure.
Measuring blood pressure is another problem, many people who on one occasion had too high a blood pressure didn't have it when blood pressure was taken at a later moment, we call it White coat hypertension
. In the large Australian therapeutic trial in mild hypertension study published in The Lancet on 14 June 1980 they found that even after 3 measurements of too high a blood pressure 504 (12,8%) of the in total 3932 participants had a blood pressure below the inclusion range at the 4th, 5th etc. measurement so weren't that hypertensive at all. So before treating high blood pressure just make sure it really is too high.
Usually the first measurement is falsely high, we repeat measuring blood pressure until we have two measurements within 5% of each other, the mean of which we consider the right measurement.
You can help your doc by measuring your own blood pressure at home using a validated blood pressure monitor, following the recommendation above, and writing the measurements down.
Here you find a validated list (in green) of blood pressure monitors:
dabl Educational Trust|Monitors for Self-measurement of
Blood
Pressure (SBPM)

I would go for an upper arm blood pressure monitor. They costs around US$ 100,- Don't just buy a cheap one, because they aren't reliable so are no good.
By now we have scientifically proven non pharmacological means to treat high blood pressure, being:
loosing weight (most important)
3-4 times a week 30-60 minutes of (aerobic and isometric) exercises
relaxation exercises
less than 1 alcoholic drink a day
avoid salt in the food (unfortunately not all hypertensives are salt sensitive, so works only FOR some) strive for 2 to max 6 grams of salt a day in your food
don't smoke: smoking will damage your cardiovascular system more than the protection you gain from anti-hypertensive therapy.
some research is being done on supplementing potassium, calcium, omega 3 fatty acids, low fat diets etc.

Thousands, even millions of shovels are provided, with some people making hundreds of trips and getting rewarded for all the shovels they are carrying. A few enterprising individuals even find a way to bring the same shovel multiple times.
What of those people who pick up a shovel and dig, eventually uncovering the treasures?
""Sorry, we are only giving rewards to those who are providing shovels. Thank you for revealing this treasure, though.""
To me, that's just backwards.
So, I am leaving. In addition, though some will disagree with my choice, I am reburying my treasures.
Thank you to all who upvoted my answers; what I am doing may seem that I am ungrateful to you but please be assured I very much appreciate the support and encouragement you provided.

491e1d22,Can a person with high blood pressure exercise?,"If you have high blood pressure, your doctor or nurse may suggest that you try to become more active to lower it. However, you may be worried that regular exercise will increase your blood pressure to dangerous levels.
It is true that physical activity (exercise) will cause your blood pressure to rise for a short time. However, when you stop the activity, your blood pressure should soon return to normal. The quicker it does this, the fitter you are likely to be.
Most people with high blood pressure should be able to increase their physical activity levels quite safely.
However, if your blood pressure is relatively high, your doctor or nurse may prefer to lower it with medicines before starting you on an exercise programme. If your blood pressure is very high, you should not start any new activity without consulting your doctor.
Researchers at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., studied about 400 women between 45 and 75. All were overweight or obese, sedentary, and had high blood pressure. Researchers divided the women into four groups, three of which exercised at different intensity levels and for different lengths of time. The fourth group remained sedentary.
Six months later, all three groups of active women had improved blood pressure readings, the researchers found. The numbers for the group that did the most intense exercise were only slightly better than those of the group that worked out least intensely. Though the women did not lose weight, they benefited greatly from better improving their cardiovascular fitness.
Everyone — especially those with health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure — should get at least 2 and a half hours of modest exercise every week.
One of the best and easiest exercises you can do is walk. You can walk anywhere, and it doesn’t require any equipment beyond a good pair of sneakers.

1c0515d6,My blood pressure is 140/70. Is it high?,"Okay, good question! Actually, I'm a medical student hope my answer would be helpful to you!
What actually blood pressure is? It is the pressure which is exerted by the blood on the arteries ( in which the blood is flowing ) during the contraction of the left ventricle.
If we talk about the normal blood pressure range it's like - 90/60 to 120 / 80…its the range given on the books…but nowadays due to our living style, the type of food we eat, the type of work we engaged with etc has influenced it…140 / 70 is considered normal in adults due to all the factors I discussed above…
But if it is above 160/100( hypertension ) and below 80/60 ( hypotension ) then it could be harmful and can lead to cardiovascular diseases…Both the conditions are fatal…
Here I'm discussing the preventions.
For hypertensive patients -
1- change your living style.
2 - avoid more consumption of salt as salt has the property to cause water retention in the body hence cause increased blood volume and therefore increased blood pressure.
3- Maintain our weight as overweight causes hypertension.
4- exercise daily.
5- reduce stress as it causes secretion of some hormones that cause high bp.
6- Avoid the consumption of alcohol and say no to smoking.
7- say no to fast food…as they cause accumulation of fat/cholesterol in the blood vessels causing their narrowing hence increased blood pressure.
8- eat daily a slice of garlic in the morning as garlic has the property to reduce the amount of cholesterol/ fat accumulated in the blood vessels ( by melting )
Thanks!
This is my first answer on quora since have joined here…

Further research has shown that this is not true, and it now appears that teenagers develop high blood pressure in approximately the same proportions as adults.
In other words, most cases of high blood pressure in teenagers are classified as primary hypertension. As with adults, the underlying causes of primary hypertension are not entirely understood.
Time of day: Blood pressure changes throughout the day.
Physical activity: Blood pressure is usually higher during and right after exercise.
Emotions: Feeling angry, afraid, or happy can affect blood pressure: Feeling anxious or nervous at the healthcare provider's office may also affect blood pressure.
Age, height, weight, and gender: Blood pressure is lower in infants compared with older children. Taller children usually have higher blood
pressure than shorter children: Overweight or obese children are more likely to have high blood pressure. And boys usually have slightly higher blood pressure than girls.
In these patients, angioplasty with stent placement may greatly improve or cure the high blood pressure and reduce the need for medicines. In some patients, kidney function is threatened by the blockage, and interventional radiology
may prevent the need for dialysis."

I want to share some high blood pressure techniques from Crystal Wood’s WordPress blog: Top 8 tips that can help to lower your high blood pressure in just 9 mins. Crystal Wood is a famous blogger about blood pressure.
Crystal Wood’s Tip 1: Lose weight. Being overweight means that your heart has to pump blood to a larger body mass, which makes the heart work harder. Losing weight reduces the workload. “Plus, your heart will be better able to respond to circumstances that do require more work, like exercise,” says Dr. Zusman.
Crystal Wood’s Tip 2: Exercise. Any activity that gets your heart pumping faster and your lungs working harder is one of the best ways to lower high blood pressure. “It improves the blood vessels’ ability to open and close, which improves blood flow,” says Dr. Zusman. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.
Crystal Wood’s Tip 3: Reduce your stress. Chronic stress may contribute to high blood pressure. More research is needed to determine the effects of chronic stress on blood pressure. Occasional stress also can contribute to high blood pressure if you react to stress by eating unhealthy food, drinking alcohol or smoking.
Crystal Wood’s Tip 4: Reduce sodium in your diet
Crystal Wood’s Tip 5: Control underlying conditions.
Crystal Wood’s Tip 6: Stop caffeine.
Crystal Wood’s Tip 7: Limit alcohol intake.

02898bb6,Is high blood pressure a silent killer?,"Livedia palace, in Crimea, Yalta, located in southern Ukraine, at the shores of Black Sea, was the summer retreat of Russian Tsar, Nicholas II. With 116 rooms, each one furnished in different taste and design it was the ultimate in opulence. It was here that on February 4, 1945, the big three world leaders met.
The British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, the American President Franklin D Roosevelt, and Chairman Of Russian Federation, Joseph Stalin, the trio finally decided to draw the curtain on to one of the bloodiest of human conflicts, the second world war. While they conferred and mediated to end the animosity, unknown to these three men, a common enemy was on their job, working silently, planning a sinister personal attack on each one of them, an attack of a different kind. Hypertension.
Exactly 68 days later, President Franklin D Roosevelt died of a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Joseph Stalin in 1953 and Sir Winston Churchill in 1966, died from cerebral stroke. All the three world leaders succumbed to the complication of a totally preventable disease - high blood pressure, ‘hypertension’ in medical terms.
The most important strategy in a war is an early and clear understanding of the sting and reach of this silent enemy. Till recently, doctors failed to do so as far as ‘hypertension’ was concerned. As recent as 1931, the British Medical Journal (BMJ) editorial warned “The greatest danger to man with high blood pressure lies in its discovery, because then some fool is certain to try and reduce it…..”
For two long years preceding President Roosevelt’s death, his physicians recorded the President’s blood pressure as high as 200/110 many times, (severe hypertension by today’s standards) but never felt alarmed. On 13th April 1945, the day after President’s death, his physician issued a statement that ‘his death came out of clear sky’ meaning that there was no warning at all. At that time no one thought that this level of blood pressure was abnormal and could cause a brain hemorrhage or stroke. This lack of human understanding of its long term complications, is what makes high blood pressure unique.
Hypertension is often referred to as a disease of 50%! Actually this denotes that only about 50% people with high blood pressure are aware of it, of those aware, only 50% are treated, and of those lucky ones being treated, only 50% are controlled to the recommended goal. In India it is a dismal 30% instead of the western 50%. Stroke, brain hemorrhage, loss of vision, heart attack, bulging of vessels in the chest (aneurysm), kidney failure, you name it and all of them are listed as the complications of hypertension.
One major problem of hypertension detection, unlike other diseases, is that it has hardly any symptoms; silent. Majority of patients with high blood pressure don’t have headache or vision problem or get angry or annoyed soon, despite popular belief to the contrary. This means there are hardly any warning signs. The victim can easily be an apparently healthy, you or me. So the only way out is to get our pressures checked and know our numbers.
It takes less than 5 minutes for a medical professional to record blood pressure. Undetected high blood pressure can result in a massive brain hemorrhage and kill a person instantly. Even if the victim survives the stroke, the social and economic implications of living with a stroke related disability is even more painful. The December Issue of ‘Lancet’ quotes the Global Burden of Disease (GDB 2010) database to show that high blood pressure ranks as the number one risk factor responsible for death and disability worldwide.
All that we request is just 5 minutes of your time. In return you might benefit by decades of healthy future. Call it a short cut to good health, if you wish."

My name is Mildred Reyes. I would like to share some high blood pressure techniques from Jean Flores’s WordPress blog as followings. Jean Flores is a famous doctor.
BEST FOODS FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE RECOMMENDED BY HARVARD HEALTH:
1- Leafy greens
2- Berries
3- Red beets
4- Skim milk and yogurt
5- Oatmeal

7- Salmon, mackerel, and fish with omega-3s

10- Dark chocolate
11- Pistachios
12- Olive oil
13- Pomegranates
Jean Flores also shares some useful tips below:
1. Walk and exercise regularly
As Jean Flores, Regular exercise helps make your heart stronger and more efficient at pumping blood, which lowers the pressure in your arteries. In fact, 150 minutes of moderate exercise, such as walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, such as running, per week can help lower blood pressure and improve your heart health.

pressure
2. Reduce your sodium intake
As Jean Flores, Salt intake is high around the world. In large part, this is due to processed and prepared foods. In many studies, salt has been linked to high blood pressure and heart events, like stroke. If you already have high blood pressure, it's worth cutting back your sodium intake to see if it makes a difference. Swap out processed foods with fresh ones and try seasoning with herbs and spices, rather than salt.
3. Drink less alcohol
As Jean Flores, Drinking alcohol can raise blood pressure. In fact, alcohol is linked to 16% of high blood pressure cases around the world.While some research has suggested that low-to-moderate amounts of alcohol may protect the heart, those benefits may be offset by negative effects.
4. Eat more potassium-rich foods
As Jean Flores, Potassium is an important mineral. It helps your body get rid of sodium and ease pressure on your blood vessels. To get a better balance of potassium to sodium in your diet, focus on eating fewer processed foods and more fresh, whole foods.
5. Cut back on caffeine
As Jean Flores, If you've ever downed a cup of coffee before you've had your blood pressure taken, you'll know that caffeine causes an instant boost. If you suspect you're caffeine-sensitive, cut back to see if it lowers your blood pressure (20Trusted Source).
6. Learn to manage stress
As Jean Flores, Stress is a key driver of high blood pressure. When you're chronically stressed, your body is in a constant fight-or-flight mode. On a physical level, that means a faster heart rate and constricted blood vessels. When you experience stress, you might also be more likely to engage in other behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or eating unhealthy food, that can negatively affect blood pressure.
7. Lose weight
As Jean Flores, If you're overweight, losing weight can make a big difference for your heart health. According to a 2016 study, losing 5% of your body mass could significantly lower high blood pressure. In previous studies, losing 17 pounds (7.7 kg) was linked to lowering systolic blood pressure by 8.5 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 6.5 mm Hg (28Trusted Source).
8. Try meditation or deep breathing
As Jean Flores, While these two behaviors could also fall under ""stress reduction techniques,"" meditation and deep breathing deserve specific mention. Both meditation and deep breathing are thought to activate the parasympathetic nervous system. This system is engaged when the body relaxes, slowing the heart rate and lowering blood pressure.
9. Cut added sugar and refined carbs
As Jean Flores, There's a growing body of research showing a link between added sugar and high blood pressure. In the Framingham Women's Health Study, women who drank even one soda per day had higher levels than those who drank less than one soda per day. Another study found that having one less sugar-sweetened beverage per day was linked to lower blood pressure.
10. Eat berries
As Jean Flores, Berries are full of more than just juicy flavor. They're also packed with polyphenols, natural plant compounds that are good for your heart. One small study had middle-aged people eat berries for eight weeks. Participants experienced improvements in different markers of heart health, including blood pressure.

In the majority of cases,one develops high BP for many years and if left untreated ( because high BP cause little or no symptoms)…heart disease follows.You can imagine that in high bp the inner walls of your blood vessels are under high pressure thus wear and tear of this lining is increased greatly) and the media size vessels in your heart will begin to become damaged..causing narrowing and heart problems from poor circulation of heart muscle….also increase in bp over many years causes the heart ( the pump) to become overworked..and can increase the size of heart muscle leading to hear failure.
The big picture is of a person with not just one illness but multiple issues going on,like poor diet,stress,poor lifestyle with high saturated fat foods,little exercise,poor sleep, obesity,high lipids and borderline elevated blood sugar levels……
the short answer is yes…you can consider that if you have a diagnosis of high bp,you will have some degree of heart problems…and need to consider all the risks I mentioned and begin to take charge of your health…."
58027e6c,Why does sodium increase blood pressure?,"Salt / Sodium Effects On Blood Pressure And Brain to kidney >
Salt works on your kidneys to make your body hold on to more water.
This extra stored water raises your blood pressure and puts strain on your kidneys, arteries, heart and brain.
Kidneys
Arteries
Hear
t
brain
Your body removes unwanted fluid by filtering your blood through your kidneys. Here any extra fluid is sucked out and put into your bladder to be removed as urine.
To do this, your kidneys use osmosis to draw the extra water out of your blood. This process uses a delicate balance of sodium and potassium to pull the water across a wall of cells from the bloodstream into a collecting channel that leads to the bladder.
Eating salt raises the amount of sodium in your bloodstream and wrecks the delicate balance, reducing the ability of your kidneys to remove the water.
The result is a higher blood pressure due to the extra fluid and extra strain on the delicate blood vessels leading to the kidneys.
Over time, this extra strain causes damage the kidneys - known as kidney disease. This reduces their ability to filter out unwanted and toxic waste products, which then start to build up in the body.
If kidney disease is left untreated and the blood pressure isn't lowered, the damage can lead to kidney failure. This is when the kidneys are no longer able to be filter the blood and the body slowly becomes poisoned by its own toxic waste products.
These five condiments top the list of salt traps:
Ketchup & BBQ sauce
We know that there’s a lot of sugar in ketchup – and unlike what Ronald Reagan once said, it doesn’t count as a serving of vegetables! But the salt factor in ketchup is also something to consider. One tablespoon of ketchup – about what you might put on your hotdog at a hockey game from one of those little packets – clocks in at 167 mg of sodium. That’s 7% of the daily recommended dose for an adult. For a child, well it’s not hard to do the math when most dietitians recommend no sodium for kids at all.
Mustard
A serving of mustard, that other street-meat condiment, has around the same amount of sodium as ketchup– 150 mg. And those fancy French Dijon mustards from France don’t change a thing. Most contain about 120 mg.
…just in case you’. It also contains over 100mg per tablespoon.
Hot Sauce
One teaspoon can clock in as high as 120 mg of salt –not as “hot” as one might think. But we must admit, a little goes a long way. If you like it hot, you can always try a couple of shakes of chillies into your cooking instead.
Soy Sauce
Finally, the very condiment that is often used to replace table salt is another super-carrier: Soy sauce. Just one tablespoon has over 900 mg of sodium – that’s almost half your daily intake! Even reduced-sodium soy sauce contains over 500 mg. How about making your own peanut sauce, or squeezing a little lemon on your food?
Salad dressing
Eating a healthy salad? Good job! Now, check the sodium content of what you’ve smothered on top: Italian salad dressing contains 430 milligrams in just 2 tablespoons! You’ll likely use at least that. – Maybe try a little lemon , and herbs , balsamic vinegar instead
Today’s food culture of being able to eat whatever we want, whenever we want has made it difficult for people to limit their intakes, which has led to two-thirds of Americans being overweight. Like an alcoholic or smoker who is trying to quit, advising them to just have one drink or one cigarette a day will do little to eliminate the cravings or the overall habit; it will only leave them frustrated, with that taste still in their mouth, wanting more. Giving up salt, oil and/or sugar can feel the same way for many people, a state that TrueNorth Health Center calls “The Pleasure Trap.
SOS/salt oils/sugar
Nutritionally speaking, we do not need to add salt, oil and sugar to our food; we can get all the sodium, fat and sugar we need, and in their best forms, from eating a whole-food, plant-based diet
. The body’s actual need for sodium and essential fats are in fact pretty low (less than the amount of sodium in ¼ teaspoon of salt a day and less than 10% of daily calories from fat), so we don’t need to supplement with any added salt and oil."
af6585ac,Is stress the cause of high blood pressure?,"STRESS! A phenomenon that you suffer from during your daily hustle owing to a haphazard work-pressure, unbalanced schedule without any ME-time! Often, we want to take a break, we want to escape the exhaustion but there’s no beating that as you grow to take more responsibilities, both professionally and personally.

bafac3bf,Are there some medicines that can cause high blood pressure?,"I am Nicole Ortiz. I would like to share some high blood pressure tricks from Paula Kim’s website: Top 8 tips that can help to lower your high blood pressure in just 9 mins. Paula Kim is a famous blogger about blood pressure.
Paula Kim’s Tip 1: Lose weight. Being overweight means that your heart has to pump blood to a larger body mass, which makes the heart work harder. Losing weight reduces the workload. “Plus, your heart will be better able to respond to circumstances that do require more work, like exercise,” says Dr. Zusman.
Paula Kim’s Tip 2: Exercise. Any activity that gets your heart pumping faster and your lungs working harder is one of the best ways to lower high blood pressure. “It improves the blood vessels’ ability to open and close, which improves blood flow,” says Dr. Zusman. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.
Paula Kim’s Tip 3: Reduce your stress. Chronic stress may contribute to high blood pressure. More research is needed to determine the effects of chronic stress on blood pressure. Occasional stress also can contribute to high blood pressure if you react to stress by eating unhealthy food, drinking alcohol or smoking.
Paula Kim’s Tip 4: Reduce sodium in your diet
Paula Kim’s Tip 5: Control underlying conditions.
Paula Kim’s Tip 6: Stop caffeine.
Paula Kim’s Tip 7: Limit alcohol intake.
Paula Kim’s Tip 8: Stop smoking.

Sodium is an essential element - if we do not have enough of it, we die. Most often, the sodium given in the IV fluid is the same concentration as what is in our bodies. If the IV is being given to replace lost fluids or lost sodium, it is not likely to affect the blood pressure of someone with hypertension (high blood pressure) because you are just replacing what they already had.
If too much IV fluid is given to someone with some kinds of kidney disease or some kinds of heart disease, their blood pressure can go up but in these instances it is usually because of the volume of fluid, not the salt that is in it."

If you are suffering from both blood pressure and diabetes, perhaps both are related. For me, when I could control blood sugar well, my BP seems to be in control without any medication. Of course, your case need not be so.
There is no perfect diet. Many diet schemes are available such as low carb diets, high fat diets, fruit diets. Some are fad and dangerous for us. It is better that assess and find a menu which reduces intake of carbohydrates( try to reduce carb intake slowly to less that 150g in total per day). Have a food weighing scale and a carb counting table(download from web). Take less amount of rice, wheat and high carb vegetables. You can take some brown rices of sonamasouri for which glycemic index is low. Always consider taking limited amounts of low glycemic foods. Consult with a capable dietician(very difficult to find in India), and fix the total energy needs and how much to take in each meal considering your medication. Have a decent proportion of carbs, protein and fats. Our food sources should also contain enough micro nutrients which reduces the inflammation load on the body. The following are Joslin’s guideline essentials (shown as approximate percents of daily calories):Diabetes & Diet: A Personalized Approach
Carbohydrate: 40 percent from carbohydrates, including at least 20-35 grams of fiber. Best carbohydrate/high-fiber sources: fresh vegetables, fruits, beans and whole-grain foods. Eat less of these carbs: pasta, white bread, white potatoes and sugary cereals.
Protein: 20-30 percent from protein (unless you have kidney disease). Best protein sources: fish, skinless chicken or turkey, nonfat or low-fat dairy products, tofu and legumes (beans and peas).
Fat: 30-35 percent from fat (mostly mono- and polyunsaturated fats). Best fat sources: olive oil, canola oil, nuts, seeds and fatty fish like salmon.
There are many other types of dietary recommendations, but you or your doctor is the best judge. Always test for sugar levels before and after 2hrs of taking each type of food. In this way find out what type food is best for you. Use curry leaves, garlic, cinnamon and other spices lavishly. Reduce salt, artificial taste making items and flavours. Grind your curry powders yourself.
Once your sugar is in control and High BP persists consult your doctor and take medications. Alternatively some foods are also known to reduce BP(again you need to measure BP regularly and check whether these do have any effect). Regular exercise and yoga will be beneficial for both diabetes and HBP.

b8b10ff1,"Which condition is worse, high blood pressure or diabetes, and why?","This is a little bit like asking if it is worse to be shot or to be stabbed. They are both dangerous. The common thing about each of them is it is not the conditions themselves that we worry about, but rather what they can do. When uncontrolled, both diabetes and high blood pressure are huge risk factors for heart attack and stroke.
Remember that there are two forms of diabetes, type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is a different animal, in that if it is not treated, it is rapidly fatal. I assume you are asking about the far more common type 2 diabetes.
High blood pressure (hypertension) is more likely to be acutely dangerous. If it gets high enough, it can cause acute damage to the heart and kidneys, and can lead to burst blood vessels in the brain. Out of control blood pressure is more likely to land you in the hospital than out of control type 2 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes is usually not something that causes rapid onset problems, but when not controlled leads to a host of issues with the heart, kidneys, brain, eyes, and nervous system.
My general experience is that hypertension is easier to control than type 2 diabetes, most of the time. Diabetics require more comprehensive lifestyle management than h hypertensives do. Also, the great majority of type 2 diabetics also have hypertension, so they get the worst of both worlds as it is."

This is called Atherosclerosis
Which causes blood flow to become more forceful, making it easier for your ear to detect the beats. You can generally hear this type of tinnitus in both ears.
This type of tinnitus is known as pulsatile tinnitus because it ‘pulses’ with the heart rhythm .
The good news is that by treating high blood pressure one can lessen the impact of pulsatile tinnitus."

09e16e21,Can high blood pressure be cured by increasing the urine output?,"No.
By increasing the urine output high BP cannot be cured.
Body must maintain the blood volume in tight range. Blood volume must be maintained at 6 to 7% of the body weight. No medicines can reduce reduce the blood volume.
Body is 70% fluid. Blood is only 10% of the total fluid. 90% of the fluid is there in cells and space between cells. If diuretics reduce the blood volume that will be immediately taken from the cells. If on day 1 the blood volume is reduced by 100 ml. Within 50 days the blood volume will be reduced by 5000 ml. The person will be dead much before this.
The analogy given in another answer is based on the wrong assumptions.
Diuretics force the cells to give up some of the fluids. That eases the situation for some time. Diuretics do not work beyond 4–5 years. Then person has to shift to some other medicines.
To cure blood pressure we must understand why there is excess fluid in cells. Reduce the excess fluid in cells naturally and cure high blood pressure.
The water that we drink on empty stomach or excess water that we drink with meals reaches in large intestines. Large intestines absorb only water and vitamins. This water gets into cells. That results in low concentration of minerals and other nutrients.
The imbalance in minerals in cells causes high blood pressure. The imbalance in minerals can be naturally cured by hydration dehydration cycles and walk and rest routines as mentioned on my Quora profile.
Every body should try these natural cures before starting medicines to lower blood pressure. Medicines kill people. Out body is perfect machine. Our misunderstanding and quest to make money causes illness."

The new guideline adopts a key component of the 2013 cholesterol guideline and incorporates overall cardiovascular risk.

Many people newly defined as hypertensive because they have a systolic blood pressure between 130-139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure between 80-89 mm Hg do not need to take drugs.
The previous guidelines set the threshold at 140/90 mm Hg for people younger than age 65 and 150/80 mm Hg for those ages 65 and older. This means 70% to 79% of men ages 55 and older are now classified as having hypertension. That includes many men whose blood pressure had previously been considered healthy.
A hypertensive crisis is a severe increase in blood pressure that can lead to a stroke. Extremely high blood pressure — a top number (systolic pressure) of 180 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher or a bottom number (diastolic pressure) of 120 mm Hg or higher — can damage blood vessels."

Don’t smoke. Don’t use pills. Cocaine, for example, can increase the risk of bleeding in the brain. Drive carefully, and wear your seat bel If you ride a bike, always wear a helmet. Study corrective surgery. If you suffer from abnormalities, such as aneurysms, an operation may help to prevent future bleeding. Be careful with Coumadin. If you take this drug, also called warfarin, follow up regularly with your doctor to make sure your blood levels are in the correct range.
If are looking for brain hemorrhages then you should Contact Neurologist in Jaipur"
0e09ff07,What is the time of recovery for a brain hemorrhage?,"It entirely depends on the location and severity of the hemorrhage. For example, if it's coming from a tiny blood vessel in the part of the brain that controls your left hand, you wouldn't likely lose consciousness at all. But if it happened in a major blood vessel near your brainstem, you probably would never wake up, because you would most likely be dead.
Most hemorrhages are somewhere in between. It could be a few minutes, hours, days, or longer.
If you know someone currently unconscious from a brain hemorrhage, you should ask their doctor or someone else who is taking care of them. And you have my sympathy because that is a hard situation, especially when you don't know how long it will last.
If you need to know what kind of hemorrhage would cause someone to be unconscious for a specific amount of time (maybe you're writing a book or a game or some such) then I recommend asking another question along the lines of “What is a plausible location for a brain hemorrhage that would cause someone to be unconscious for (however long)? For a story, I want to know how a doctor would describe it.”
Either way, I hope things go well."
72b03708,What is a brain hemorrhage?,"A brain
hemorrhage
is a type of stroke
. It's caused by an artery
in the brain
bursting and causing localized bleeding in the surrounding tissues. This bleeding kills brain
cells.
The Greek root for blood
is hemo. Hemorrhage literally means ""blood
bursting forth."" Brain
hemorrhages are also called cerebral hemorrhages, intracranial hemorrhages, or intracerebral hemorrhages. They account for about 13% of strokes.
What Happens During a Brain Hemorrhage?
When blood from trauma irritates brain
tissues, it causes swelling. This is known as cerebral edema
. The pooled blood collects into a mass called a hematoma
. These conditions increase pressure on nearby brain tissue, and that reduces vital blood flow and kills brain cells.
Bleeding can occur inside the brain, between the brain and the membranes that cover it, between the layers of the brain's covering or between the skull and the covering of the brain.
What Causes Bleeding in the Brain?
There are several risk factors and causes of brain hemorrhages. The most common include:
Head trauma
. Injury is the most common cause of bleeding in the brain for those younger than age 50.
High blood pressure
. This chronic condition can, over a long period of time, weaken blood vessel walls. Untreated high blood pressure
is a major preventable cause of brain hemorrhages.
Aneurysm
. This is a weakening in a blood vessel wall that swells. It can burst and bleed into the brain, leading to a stroke
.
Blood vessel abnormalities. (Arteriovenous malformations) Weaknesses in the blood vessels in and around the brain may be present at birth and diagnosed only if symptoms develop.
Amyloid angiopathy. This is an abnormality of the blood vessel walls that sometimes occurs with aging and high blood pressure
. It may cause many small, unnoticed bleeds before causing a large one.
Blood or bleeding disorders. Hemophilia
and sickle cell anemia
can both contribute to decreased levels of blood platelets.
Liver
disease. This condition is associated with increased bleeding in general.
Brain tumors
What Are the Symptoms of Brain Bleeding?
The symptoms of a brain hemorrhage can vary. They depend on the location of the bleeding, the severity of the bleeding, and the amount of tissue affected. Symptoms may develop suddenly or over time. They may progressively worsen or suddenly appear.
If you exhibit any of the following symptoms, you may have a brain hemorrhage. This is a life-threatening condition, and you should call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. The symptoms include:
A sudden severe headache
Seizures
with no previous history of seizures
Weakness
in an arm or leg
Nausea
or vomiting
Decreased alertness; lethargy
Changes in vision
Tingling or numbness
Difficulty speaking or understanding speech
Difficulty swallowing
Difficulty writing or reading
Loss of fine motor skills, such as hand tremors
Loss of coordination
Loss of balance
An abnormal sense of taste
Loss of consciousness
Keep in mind that many of these symptoms are often caused by conditions other than brain hemorrhages.

If you exhibit any of the following symptoms, you may have a brain hemorrhage. This is a life-threatening condition, and you should call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. The symptoms include:
A sudden severe headache
Seizures with no previous history of seizures
Weakness in an arm or leg
Nausea or vomiting
Decreased alertness; lethargy
Changes in vision
Tingling or numbness
Difficulty speaking or understanding speech
Difficulty swallowing
Difficulty writing or reading
Loss of fine motor skills, such as hand tremors
Loss of coordination
Loss of balance
An abnormal sense of taste
Loss of consciousness
Keep in mind that many of these symptoms are often caused by conditions other than brain hemorrhages."

b996c4e6,Do patients of brain hemorrhages survive?,"Hemorrhagic stroke is life threatening. Up to half of all people with intracerebral hemorrhage die. Many of these deaths occur within the first two days. For those who survive a brain hemorrhage, recovery is slow. Only 12% of people are able to recover complete or near-complete functioning within 30 days of the stroke."
d5f4a625,What problems occur after AVM brain hemorrhage?,"It depends on where the location of the bleed occurred and for how long the bleed occurred without repair. Different areas of the brain are effected differently. Coordination/balance can be effected, as well as speech, eyesight etc. It all depends on the location and the amount of time the bleed was left untreated."
36c36a45,Why are brain hemorrhages fatal?,"Not all are fatal but they are certainly serious.
There are lots of components to this phenomenon.
It occurs in a closed space that being the skull.
The blood that is escaping the vessels is free to expand within that space.
Blood when outside a vessel is irritating so that causes more swelling.
So this becomes a pressure phenomenon within a closed or confined space, which then causes stress upon other tissues and that problem begins a cascade of damage including brain herniation Brain
herniation - Wikipedia
Sadly, if it’s an aneurysm Cerebral Aneurysm
which causes this. It can all happen very quickly due to the fact that it’s, arterial blood which is under higher pressure, and that can contribute to it being fatal."
a31441bb,How did Dylan MacIntyre get a brain-hemorrhaging injury?,"There are many causes of brain hemorrhaging. Some of them include a tangling of blood vessels, bleeding disorders, cerebral aneurysms, head injury, and the use of blood thinners. Drug use and smoking may also cause hemorrhages.
I wrote this answer so that you can be aware of the risk. Otherwise, how Dylan got a brain-hemorrhaging injury isn't our business. It's in his discretion to disclose."
19f96f0f,What happens in a brain hemorrhage?,"A brain haemorrhage is a type of stroke. The bleeding artery in its surrounding tissues causes cerebral edema. The resulting hematona causes pressure on the brain and consequently vital blood flow is interrupted which causes the death of brain cells.
It is possible for the person to experience some degree of recovery however this is dependent on how quickly treatment is administered."
9b0d156b,What are the long term effects of brain hemorrhage?,"The answer to this question has several factors we have to consider.
Without the oxygen carried by blood, brain cells can quickly die and lead to permanent brain damage.
Obviously, you can guess that the location where the hemorrhage occurs is the most important determining factor.
A brain hemorrhage can literally cause someone to just drop dead without warning. While that is an extreme case, ICHs can cause severe and permanent brain damage.
This photo shows a massive yet textbook cerebrovascular event:
(A) MASSIVE cerebral infarct in the deep layers of the left-hemisphere.
(B) Left cranial defect and decrease in a shift of midline structures on the first day after decompressive craniectomy.
If you have a weak stomach look away.
There is a huge subarachnoid beginning to form in (A) and this puts an extreme amount of pressure on the underlying tissue. The former is clearly demonstrated in the first photo, as the midline has shifted dramatically. Two days post-op, the patient remained in a vegetative state.
If the ICH causes severe cranial vascular malformation, death increases tenfold. Since ICHs occur as a result of a ruptured blood vessel, whether it be trauma-induced or the result of an aneurysm, blood flow to the brain (or that specific region) is rendered FUBARed.
Deep intracranial hemorrhages are very difficult to operate on. As a surgeon, our first priority is to locate and stop the bleeding as fast as possible. Deep ICHs flood the entire brain, and locating one that does not present superficially is like trying to find an ice cube in a swimming pool.
As surgeons, we also have to consider the structural integrity of the surrounding tissue. We can't just go Rambo in a brain, stop the bleed, and expect the patient to regain complete function- that's Ludacris.
Antihypertensive agents are used in large quantities to lower the patient's blood pressure. Higher blood pressure=more bleeding.
The problem herein is that the brain tissue is inherently DAF (delicate as fuck), sometimes we can only stop the bleed without vascular complete reconstruction. As a result, the patient will likely suffer permanent handicaps with regard to the amount of tissue death.
The harm: benefit ratio is imperative to consider when a patient presents with a massive ICH. Keep in mind that it is still a race against the clock. We locate the ICH, but we are far from out of the woods; as is the patient.
tPAs can be used in the case of an ischemic stroke to break-up a blood clot, restoring blood flow. Hemorrhagic strokes and severe ICHs cannot be treated with tPAs, as clotting factors act as our friend when we are trying to prevent further blood loss.
NOW.
Recovery from a hemorrhagic stroke is slow and requires a prolonged hospital stay. Occupational, speech, and physical therapy may also be needed to improve motor skills affected by brain damage.
I have seen minor cases where a patient can be discharged after a few days.
Unfortunately, since ACHs are not forgiving at all, I have seen many severe cases that require full craniotomies, vascular surgeons, neurosurgeons, and the like.
Generally, in order to stop the bleed, further damage is an inevitable part of this process. I have seen a countless number of patients die before and during surgery, and brain hemorrhages really don't fuck around.
It is a literal bloody mess, but I have seen patients regain near complete functionality, however after the air hits the brain- no one is the same.
I hope that answered your question. Feel free to message me if you need more info."

7d932229,Is taking aspirin to prevent a stroke a probable risk for a brain hemorrhage?,"First of all, it matters how much aspirin you are talking about, and how often. It’s typically used to thin the blood for the heart. When patients would tell me this, they would say the doctor told me to take and aspirin a day, or a half of an aspirin per day (which breaks the enteric coating and causes stomach issues). Many times, the patients wouldn’t put it on their meds list, because it’s “just” aspirin, I’d look into their eye, and ask if they were taking aspirin. They would ask how I knew; they would have “micro aneurysms”, little microscopic bleeding in the eye.
A standard Aspirin is 325 mg, too much for daily consumption, as is a half 162mg; half of a half aspirin has been the most common dosage for daily use, that’s 81mg, sold as a chewable baby aspirin (my choice) or as the brand Ecotrin.
As for strokes, as you get older, a doctor can turn the end of a stethoscope around to the “Bell” potion and listen to your carotid arteries in your neck, listing for what’s called “Bruit” (brewey), a swooshing sound in your neck, sometimes only in one of the 2 carotids on either side. In the eye, I can see “Holenhorst Plaques”, flat flakes that break off of the cholesterol in your carotids. When I look in, they look like someone is back in your retina with a bright yellow flashlight shining back at me, if the flat side is facing me. If on edge they are harder to see, these can be easily missed. Sometimes, I can press on the eye, and make them flash on and off. It is not a good sign. I send the patients out for an Echo, ultrasound of the carotids.
I tell the patients that they may have an impending stroke to make sure they get in, timely. I had one patient actually have a stroke, while they were doing the procedure. They hit her with some “clot buster” medications and was fine. She was very grateful at her next visit, when she told me the story. I would say ¾ th’s of patients I sent out, ended up having a procedure to remove the clots from their carotid arteries."

e57e547a,What is a brain hemorrhage and how do you overcome it?,"A brain hemorrhage refers to bleeding within the brain. This medical condition is additionally referred to as a brain bleed or an intracranial hemorrhage. it's a medical emergency that needs immediate treatment.
If a vessel within the brain leaks or bursts and causes bleeding, a hemorrhagic stroke occurs.
Treatment
Surgery could also be necessary to treat severe brain hemorrhage. Surgeons may operate to alleviate a number of the pressure on the brain.
If a burst aneurysm causes a hemorrhage, a surgeon may remove a part of the skull and clip the artery. This procedure is named a craniotomy.
Other treatment options include anti-anxiety drugs, anti-epileptic drugs, and other medications to regulate symptoms, like seizures and severe headaches.
People can get over a brain hemorrhage, although it's vital that they receive the right treatment as soon as possible.
Other treatment includes:
physical therapy
speech therapy
occupational therapy
lifestyle changes to limit the danger of another hemorrhage"

ab64d045,"What are the primary symptoms of brain hemorrhage, also mention its causes, treatment and precautions?","If and when you are feeling discomfort, flurry & shortness of breath, having pain in left hand or chest, you may think those as primary symptoms of brain haemorrhage. Trauma and blockage of blood vessels are most common cause. To check if these are real symptoms, you may try 2 or 3 steps e.g. ask the patient to- 1) smile well, 2) say a complete sentence and repeat it, 3) to utter some difficult word like Czechoslovakia, and repeat it 4) raise both of his hands high in the air, 5) protrude the tongue outside straightly. If he is unable to do all these easily then may be a brain haemorrhage has taken place and you should take the patient to the doctor, as early as possible. To prevent, in case of an elderly person and having blockage problem, he should walk slowly for at least 15 mins. Minimise , as far as possible , consumption of Fried food as these food may contain cholesterol, not to dissolve in blood. It may become the reason of blockage and bleeding in tissue or ventricles & cause brian haemorrhage. Eat green leafy vegetables as much as possible and cook these in minimum oil."

It is important to find someone who really knows what they are doing.

I hope this has been helpful."

for the quality service they provide. I have visited a few other rehab centers too, and most of them function as nursing homes and some of them as an affiliate to hospitals. Sukino is the one and only player that provides personalised, I repeat, personalised care that focuses on the person overall-wellbeing rather than just the disease. The center is aptly setup just for one service i.e. post surgery/post hospital care
Long story short: My father had brain aneurysm surgery a few years ago and the doctor told us it could take months for him to completely recover from it. My brother and I started taking turns to look after him since he couldn’t do much but we realised that it was a lot of work for us and we needed professional help. We then decided to try homecare, and little less than two weeks into it, we realised it was a wrong decision considering the intensive care he needed at that time.. That’s when a colleague of mine told me about Sukino’s neuro rehabilitation centre in Bangalore. Sukino’s team indeed helps fasten the recovery process, the way they care is what anybody would love to see their loved ones being cared for and they did it much better than my family and I would have.
My father’s treatment plan includes many sessions with physiotherapists, occupational therapists,speech and swallow therapists and yoga therapy. They also do have a dietician to guide the F&B team on a personalised diet plan. We visited him often at the centre and there was a noticeable improvement each time. Sukino’s staff were very helpful throughout the process and took care of all my father’s needs. I definitely suggest you go for Sukino – they are a caring bunch who look after their patients like family.

aca2ae3a,Which are the best full-time physiotherapy centers in India for a brain hemorrhage patient?,"I constantly accepted I'd work an all day work until the day I resigned. I had never at any point known about routine set of expenses business, significantly less thought about it as a possibility for myself.
At that point, three years into exercise based recuperation practice, I ended up at an intersection.
I had been working two low maintenance occupations at little outpatient orthopedic facilities, feeling a piece overpowered by both, and yearning to return to an emergency clinic condition. A previous colleague of mine revealed to me his emergency clinic was contracting an intense consideration routine set of expenses physical advisor—and that per diems much of the time went full-time. Along these lines, I chose to give it a go.
Things worked out: I found the activity, and routine set of expenses PT ended up being the best thing that at any point transpired as a treating clinician. The adaptability and significant compensation empowered me to concentrate on a wide range of different interests on my days off. I wrapped up never filling in as a full-time physical specialist again!
What is outlay exercise based recuperation
?
Routine set of expenses—or PRN—active recuperation differs from office to office, however as a rule, outlay PTs fill in as available to come back to work physical advisors. Offices use them for additional inclusion on days when full-time staff individuals are debilitated, traveling, or generally inaccessible. Now and again, outlay physical advisors wind up working nearly as much as full-time PTs, while in different cases, they just work a couple of days a month.
As a routine set of expenses PT, you'll some of the time realize your work dates ahead of time, however you'll regularly discover you're required the prior night—or even the day of—a move. Movements are typically eight hours in length, and they could possibly have adaptable hours, contingent upon the office.
These positions quite often come without business benefits, which means you won't get took care of time, days off (except if they're state-commanded), proceeding with instruction inclusion, medical coverage, or different advantages. Those advantages aren't modest, so in case you're not accepting them, your boss ordinarily will ""improve the pot"" by employing you at a higher hourly rate. This compensation differential is considerably increasingly articulated when you're new out of school.
Obviously, there are a few downsides also: you'll be the first to have your hours diminished when the registration drops or things get moderate. There will likewise be times when you need to see patients while different specialists go to group building occasions and workforce gatherings. Along these lines, it's anything but difficult to get a handle on left as an outlay advisor.
Basically, you can consider routine set of expenses as having ""no surprises"" on the two sides of the coin—which implies you'll have unmatched adaptability. Simultaneously, it implies you'll have to take a considerable amount of activity to guarantee you're getting what you need in the method for hours and expert development.
Here are a couple of tips to make routine set of expenses work for you:"
6afe838b,Are there any chances of survival from a brain hemorrhage?,Yes ! Most of the cases of brain haemorrhage survive albeit with some or the other neurological deficit. Mortality is seen in cases where medical help couldn't be initiated in time or the area affected was if vital importance or the patient had some co-existing morbidity.
d96a654b,How do I differentiate brain hemorrhage and infarct in a CT scan?,"First, OP, you need to attend and successfully complete medical or osteopathic school (as one would express in at least American terms.) Then you need to learn the fundamental concepts of CT scanning, including not only the basic physics, the ramifications of the BBB (Blood-Brain Barrier,) but also radiologic terms such as mass effect.
Then you can learn the attenuation and morphologic characteristics of both hemorrhage and infarction over time."
d9d4d8f9,"Why does an upper respiratory infection cause head aches, reduced neurological function, and symptoms resembling brain hemorrhage?","A headache is a symptom, not a diagnosis or a condition. People with migraines, or chronic tension headaches, or another headache disorder will frequently have headaches as a symptom or as a part of whatever else is going on, including an infection.
With URIs (Upper respiratory infections), the coughing motion transmits forces to the neck/head, increasing the likelihood of headaches to those predisposed. The valsalva (bearing down) of a cough can also increase the chance of headaches, also via the neck (not through increased intracranial pressure, at least not in most people).
Those with URIs with sinus involvement can have trigeminal irritation, increasing chance of headaches. Most actual sinus headaches present as facial or dental pain, not actual headache.
Your brain hemorrhage comment makes me wonder if you, or the person you’re thinking about, has had a brain hemorrhage previously. Symptoms of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), or any other previous structural CNS disturbance (tumor resection, MS attack, trauma), from which they have recovered can re-express the previous symptoms during a systemic illness, when tired, even at the end of a long day. This is not a new event, but the “rewiring” from the old event decompensating due to the illness/fatigue. Once no longer ill or tired, things go back to how they recently were. URI’s can certainly do this, as can the flu, a urinary tract infection, etc.
Therefore, get the flu shot, wash your hands, use purell, etc!
I hope this helped."

Other treatment options include anti-anxiety drugs, anti-epileptic drugs, and other medications to control symptoms, such as seizures and severe headaches.
People can recover from a brain hemorrhage, although it is vital that they receive the correct treatment as soon as possible. Rehabilitation can help an individual adjust to life after a brain hemorrhage.
Rehabilitation treatment includes:
Physical therapy: Who can benefit and how can it help?
Physical therapy aims to help patients maintain, recover or improve physical ability that may be impaired due to a condition or injury.

Wearing a cycle helmet can help a person prevent traumatic brain injury.
According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, about 1.7 million traumatic
brain
injuries
occur every year in the U.S. About 5.3 million people have a disability due to a previous brain injury.
It is important that people protect themselves against the risk of traumatic
brain
injury
. Wearing seatbelts in cars or helmets when riding bikes or motorcycles are easy ways to protect the head and brain.
People who have a brain hemorrhage or a stroke have a 25% chance
of another one in the future.
Making lifestyle changes can help an individual to reduce their risk or prevent a cerebrovascular event.
People with high blood pressure need to receive regular checkups and take steps to lower their blood pressure
.
It is also important to avoid smoking, which is a significant risk factor
for stroke. The toxins in tobacco damage the cardiovascular system and can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries, making them narrower and more at risk of stroke.
People with diabetes
need to make sure that they keep blood sugar levels under control. Many people with diabetes also have high blood pressure, high cholesterol
, and may be overweight, all of which are risk factors for stroke.
Some of the most significant changes that can help reduce the risk of brain hemorrhages involve diet and exercise.
Individuals should include foods in the diet that improve heart and brain health, such as the
DASH Eating Plan
Understanding the DASH eating plan will help you start and follow this plan for life. Controlling Daily Sodium and Calories To benefit from the proven DASH eating plan, it is important to limit daily sodium levels to 2,300 mg, or 1,500 mg if desired, and to consume the appropriate amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight or lose weight if needed. Ways to Control Sodium Levels The key to lowering your sodium intake is to make healthier food choices when you’re shopping, cooking, and eating out. Tips for Lowering Sodium When Shopping, Cooking, and Eating Out Shopping Cooking Eating Out Read food labels, and choose items that are lower in sodium and salt, particularly for convenience foods and condiments.* Choose fresh poultry, fish, and lean meats instead of cured food such as bacon and ham. Choose fresh or frozen versus canned fruits and vegetables. Avoid food with added salt, such as pickles, pickled vegetables, olives, and sauerkraut. Avoid instant or flavored rice and pasta. Don’t add salt when cooking rice, pasta, and hot cereals. Flavor your foods with salt-free seasoning blends, fresh or dried herbs and spices, or fresh lemon or lime juice. Rinse canned foods or foods soaked in brine before using to remove the sodium. Use less table salt to flavor food. Ask that foods be prepared without added salt or MSG, commonly used in Asian foods. Avoid choosing menu items that have salty ingredients such as bacon, pickles, olives, and cheese. Avoid choosing menu items that include foods that are pickled, cured, smoked, or made with soy sauce or broth. Choose fruit or vegetables as a side dish, instead of chips or fries. *Examples of convenience foods are frozen dinners, prepackaged foods, and soups; examples of condiments are mustard, ketchup, soy sauce, barbecue sauce, and salad dressings. Most of the sodium Americans eat comes from processed and prepared foods, such as breads, cold cuts, pizza, poultry, soups, sandwiches and burgers, cheese, pasta and meat dishes, and salty snacks. Therefore, healthier choices when shopping and eating out are particularly important. Ways to Control Calories To benefit from the DASH eating plan, it is important to consume the appropriate amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight. To help, read nutrition labels on food, and plan for success with DASH eating plan sample menus and other heart-healthy recipes . The DASH eating plan can be used to help you lose weight. To lose weight, follow the DASH eating plan and try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Find out your daily calorie needs or goals with the Body Weight Planner and calorie chart . Talk with your doctor before beginning any diet or eating plan. General tips for reducing daily calories include: Eat smaller portions more frequently throughout the day. Reduce the amount of meat that you eat while increasing the amount of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, or dry beans. Substitute low-calorie foods, such as when snacking (choose fruits or v

762c8539,How accurate is a CT scan in detecting a brain hemorrhage if done within 72 hours of occurrence?,"Very accurate.
CT scans show X-ray density differences mapped out to form an image. Fresh Blood is more X-ray dense than normal brain tissue. Therefore it is most visible immediately after the bleed.
Here is an acute subdural on the right. You can see that is more dense (whiter) than the normal brain and you can see the compression on the right lateral ventricle and the surface sulci on the right side of the brain.
As the blood ages, it gradually become less dense and less visible but still can be detected by mass effect (the displacement of normal structures). If the bleed is very minimal and has become isodense with brain, it will be very difficult to detect.
Here is a relatively large left subdural bleed that is the same density as the underlying brain but it is “effacing” the sulci and compressing the lateral ventricle. These are “mass effects” that demonstrate that there is an isodense subdural at the line. Note that these mass effects are the same as the image of the acute subdural above."

I can't really think of a way that a cardiac arrest would DIRECTLY cause a brain hemorrhage, but if you were elderly, and had v fib or asystole from a heart attack, and you collapsed and struck your head on a hard surface, that might cause a traumatic brain hemorrhage. Malignant hypertension could cause both a cardiac event and a brain hemorrhage."

Given you are not with her at this crucial moment of her life, you’re not really in love with her. Otherwise you would’ve been there with her no matter what because she’s your priority. Nothing comes before her for a man in love. And you’re asking strangers on Quora what to do. You’re not in love.
There was a King who left the throne to be with his woman. I had a friend who moved far away from his girlfriend for college. She was hospitalized. His exam was next day. If he failed the exam, he would be kicked out of the program. He didn't care. He left immediately and drove 6 hours to the hospital. He stayed with her until she was well. Then he applied to another program next year. This is what the man in love acts. Your girlfriend knows you don't really love her. Real love is not in words that you can throw from far away but in action. Therefore she and her friend are making sure you are out of her life. This is your chance to show up to prove your love.

You say “mothers.” I guess you live in a society where a man can have multiple wives. In that case, I have no idea what you can do because I don’t know how such societies operate or what resources and accommodations are available to you.
Assuming that’s a typo and you live in a Western country, I’d like to know: Does your father want to be “saved”?
In other words, what you see as torture may not seem as torture to him. In any case, this question contains too little information. We don’t know whether his handicap is paralysis, blindness, mental illness…each of which require very different accommodation.

It is perfectly natural to feel guilty in such situations and a lot of it has to do with the enormity of the loss rather than what you did and didn’t do. So many people I know have, in hindsight, thought of something that they might have done wrong to cause a loved one’s death. For example, ‘I should have taken him to X hospital and not Y.’
Please don’t let this guilt kill you. It is not as if you ignored some definite symptom which you knew would cause his death. Did you know that he had such a serious problem for a few days before his hospitalization? Only then would you be guilty of negligence. When this guilt strikes you, ask yourself if you purposely ignored his problem so that he would die. Keep rationalizing this way and with time, your guilt should subside. Best wishes."

I too had an intracerebral hemorrhage. I’m glad I didn’t know until later that 60% of people die within 30 days of this type of stroke. My neurologist saw a suspicious shadow on a CT scan and went in for a closer look. He found another (unburst) aneurysm that he strongly recommended I have fixed after my brain had had a few months to recover from the trauma of the initial stroke. I did. He “coiled” the troubling aneurysm and I am very relieved that I no longer have a “ticking time-bomb” in my brain.
I couldn’t sleep at all for months after my stroke. During sleepless nights, I read about people with post-stroke sleepiness and I envied them! Get yourself tested for sleep problems, such as sleep apnea. That can cause one to feel tired even after a “good night” of sleep. There may be other sleep related after effects of the stroke that can be addressed.
Everything is a bit harder after a stroke and normal things leave me exhausted. Over time, I’ve learned to moderate my activity to minimize this. I returned to work five months post-stroke. I found myself working and sleeping — nothing else. After a year, I spoke with my doctors and they suggested I take a few more months off work. My energy returned, a bit. I can now function, but I can’t do as much as I did before the stroke.
Give yourself a break. Let yourself rest apart from physical therapy and other rehab activities. You don’t say how long it has been, but your brain is likely still healing and rewiring itself to bypass the damaged areas. Healing continues. It has been over three years since my brain hemorrhage and I’m still recovering.

And by safely I mean like besides the obvious risks a typical human being would face.","Since there are basically NO risks to taking LSD or shrooms, I don’t know what you mean by “obvious risks.” They are utterly harmless, though they’ve managed to scare the bejeesus out of the secret police and executive branches of our government (especially after they spent a couple of years slipping acid in each others’ coffee, and dosing random strangers without warning) This has inspired them to sink a great deal of money and effort into spreading lies and propaganda meant to scare people away from self-realization and spiritual awakening. My guess is that they’re afraid these folks might vote.
I’m not a neurosurgeon, so I couldn’t say for sure. Generally speaking, I’d say the cannabis is a much greater risk than psychedelics, since some people can suffer from cannabis psychosis. I’ve been through it, and it’s no picnic. To be on the safe side, if you are going to experiment, I suggest you stick, with LSD since it’s much more predictable and does not much affect the body or nervous system, physiologically speaking. Mushrooms do have a potential for physical OD, though it’s absurdly high."

768ef4f9,How are intracerebral hemorrhages possible when blood does not enter the brain due to the blood-brain barrier?,"Blood - of course! - enters the brain! The brain has a high metabolism and is dependent on the constant supply of oxygen and glucose delivered by the blood. A compromise in bloodflow to the brain leads to an intracerebral ischemia, a stroke, with neurological symptoms due to an infarction (a death of cells supplied by the occluded vessel by for instance a bloodclot). A hemorrhage occurs when there is a rupture in the wall of the bloodvessels and blood is massed outside the vessels (which is also a stroke leading to neurological symptoms).
The blood-brain barrier is due to special properties in the lining of the capillaries in the brain preventing larger molecules ( as some drugs) from entering the intercellular fluid and the cells. It is an evolutionary developed protection of the brain, and thus the whole organism, from toxins."
44d912a9,"If there are no pain receptors in the brain, why does brain diseases like tumour or intra-cranial hemorrhage cause headaches?","Brain itself does NOT have pain receptors.

Needless to say and assert that it is not a healthy thing to do.
The violent shaking of head, even for adults, can fatally affect spinal arteries and can also cause severe neck injuries. these can call for complex surgeries
And yes there are some documented case studies where patients have had ruptured veins causing blood clots and eventual hemorrhage.

Its not the most pleasant to think about, and we always encourage hope and effort, but its important for families to be realistic, which means planning for life as it is now (at 6 weeks post) if gains happen thats great, if they don't they can be set up at home or residential care to cope with the new functional changes."

Figure source[1].
In this CT scan, though, we can see a subarachnoid hemorrhage is compressing the third ventricle (fluid-filled space) of the brain and undoubtedly putting pressure on the basal nuclei. How damaging that is to them, I don’t know. Usually an isolated subarachnoid hemorhage resulting from head trauma doesn’t require surgery.[2]
However, here you see a progressive hemorrhage from “minor head trauma” growing more deeply into the brain. “Within 24 hours of each accident, both disturbance of consciousness and hemiparesis
deteriorated.” This case[3] did require immediate surgery to relieve the pressure.

2bef5931,Is it possible to scan every blood vessel and capillary in the brain? I am asking this from a hemorrhagic stroke prevention point of view.,"It’s possible with a MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiogram) scans. Even whole body scans, with high clarity of the newest MRI scanners.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5359560_Whole-body_MRA
The resolution of MRI HD scanners today is unlike many you see online via Google that’s quite grainy. The newer scanners you can see v-e-r-y clear details. Saw my first stroke MRI within an hour upon having a stroke. The lesion looked so much like a walnut in size, shape and texture.
Is it beneficial? Depends. I have Crohn’s disease and it’s suspected that a blood clot from the intestines caused my strokes, as the MRA to the brain showed minimal build up of the arteries to the brain. A MRA of the intestines is a good precaution, as bleeds there can dislodge a clot. Only takes a 2mm clot to cause a brain stroke.
2mm is the size of some of the smallest arteries in the midbrain. No larger than the size of an uncooked angel hair pasta noodle."
642432f8,Is it possible for someone that had a car accident to have brain injury then hemorrhage?,"What I believe you wish to know is how common is hemorrhaging when an accident has occurred. Almost inevitably there will be some blood but hemorrhaging implies a much greater flow of blood. Many injuries, which are percussion in that the head has head something, will cause some subdural bleeding. Only when there is significant injury does one expect a hemorrhage. The other side of that is hemorrhages can occur within the brain with no accident or incident. Cerebral Vascular Accidents (CVAs) are a common intracranial event which often lead to ‘strokes’. But, again, there was no external incident to cause them.
The brain and the bleeding within it is a complicated situation. I’ve only simplified my answer to conform to the question."

It would do someting bad to the brain in tiny little steps that we would not recognize but would be part of an aging process.
For larger bleeds that caused symptoms it would clinically look like a stroke and be visible on a CT or MR;I it is called cerebal hemorrhage."

If there was an intracranial mass such as an aneurysm, hemorrhage, or tumor inside the brain, would nearby neurons be compressed and cause death or would neurons continue to function?","These masses do compress the nervous tissue. There may be no functional impairment, various degrees of impairment, or death, depending on the severity and location of the compression. Compression in the brainstem is more likely to be lethal (if it involves the respiratory centers, for example) whereas the same size mass and same degree of compression in the cerebrum might even go unnoticed. Some cerebral tumors grow quite large before they begin to produce symptoms."

The Frontal Lobes are usually thought of as the control center for our judgement and emotions but it does have an involvement with motor function. What you are describing could be related to your stroke or it could be something new arriving on the scene. It could be minor or it could be major, but the important thing is to check it out. There are many conditions today that improve with medical intervention and as scary as I’m sure that stroke was, the fact that you can type up a question on a computer and submit it shows that your frontal lobes are hanging in there.

fd9ada36,"The medical examiner's report read, ""hemorrhage over upper spine"" and ""fracture of upper cervical spine."" Did she die instantly? Did her brain remain conscious and for how long? Did she suffer?","There is not sufficient information in those two phrases to answer your question.
A fractured vertebrae is not necessarily fatal even at C1 or C2. It is not quite a fracture but take a look at the internal decapitation which is not always fatal.
Atlanto-occipital dislocation - Wikipedia
High level cervical spine injuries can be devastating and disabling.
The other thing to keep in mind is that, to put it crassly, dead people don’t bleed . A hemorrhage means bleeding, in this case into an internal space, not external, but bleeding nonetheless. That happened before the person died.
The kind of ergonomic forces that would cause an injury and bleeding as described could very well also cause unconsciousness- not enough information to say for sure."
61e2109c,"Is there such thing as feeling pain when there is nothing wrong with the body and the brain signal pain when tests show the patient is perfectly normal, no hemorrhage nor tumor nor broken bones?","Yes, of course. Pain is the imprint on the brain. For example, if you have a stroke in the sensory area of the brain and cannot feel a limb, then you cannot feel pain in that limb. As well, even after a limb is removed, you can still feel itching in that limb if that part of the brain is stimulated.
There are many causes for pain. They are not all local to where you feel the pain. It is not necessarily a sign that there is something wrong at that place in the body."

a4b6623a,What are the leading risk factors for having a stroke?,"If you can answer this in a Quora answer, I’d say you deserve the Nobel’s Prize in Medicine!
In some cases, it’s obvious what caused a stroke: if somebody’s obese, has really high blood pressure, is really old, etc., it’s pretty clear-cut.
But I was 115 pounds, 90/60, and 24 years old when I had my stroke. My doctors looked at me, referred me to a cardiologist for another test, which was negative, and told me to go on my way. “The chance of you having a subsequent stroke is very small,” they assured me.
Six months later, I was back in the hospital with another one. =(
About six months after THAT, I was able to peer out from beneath my lead jacket of fatigue and pick my head up enough to wonder WHY I’d had a second one. It’d be nice to figure it out, I wagered, to prevent a third one. At that point, I’d already decided that if I had another one, JUST LET ME DIE.
My speech therapist referred me to a neurologist at the big city hospital nearby. In retrospect, he was nuts, but he did decide to perform a test just to check for certain that the cardiologist I’d originally seen hadn’t missed anything. (The first test, a TEE — trans esophageal echocardiogram — checked for a hole in my heart by sticking a camera down my throat look to look at my heart. The second test, a TCD — transcranial doppler — shot minuscule bubbles into my arm via an IV and listened to my brain to see if any of them made it up there.) Lo and behold, it dinged! I had a hole in my heart that allowed bubbles/clots/etc to pass through a ventricle and into my brain.
But, a week later, the neurologist called and said he wasn’t sure that the hole was the cause of my stroked. He explained that doctors usually require both a hole and a hypercoagulable disease — i.e. you need a hole in your heart and a reason to have a clot. “Why the h*ll did you have me do this test, then?” I wanted to shout.
To make a long story short, I decided to go ahead and have surgery to close the hole. It’s not terribly risky, but it is heart surgery. I haven’t had another stroke in 12 years, I’ve had a very good neurologist tell me that clots sometimes form in the area right around the hole *just because*, I’ve had doctors tell me to get my head screwed on straight — everybody knows a hole isnt enough without a hypercoagulable disease … I’ve pretty much just given up having any chance of ever knowing what caused my strokes.
So please, figure it out! LOL"
efe5bc44,Is there a genetic factor to strokes?,"Family members share genes, behaviors, lifestyles, and environments that can influence their health and their risk for disease. Stroke risk can be higher in some families than in others, and your chances of having a stroke can go up or down depending on your age, sex, and race or ethnicity.
The good news is you can take steps to prevent it.
Genetics and Family History
When members of a family pass traits from one generation to another through genes, that process is called heredity.
Genetic factors likely play some role in high blood pressure, stroke, and other related conditions. Several genetic disorders can cause a stroke, including ssickle cell. People with a family history of stroke are also likely to share common environments and other potential factors that increase their risk.
The chances for stroke can increase even more when heredity combines with unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking cigarettes and eating an unhealthy diet.
Family health history is a record of the diseases and health conditions that happen in your family. Family health history is a useful tool for understanding health risks and preventing health problems."
2d020f38,What factors make it likely to recover from stroke induced paralysis?,"I had a massive stroke in 2001 and lost all use of my right side my speech, and my right eye. Thankfully, I was young, 27, and I was told that would help in my recovery. It took almost 3 years of PT and occupational therapy to heal and recover almost all of my function. The brain does learn to find new pathways to send signals out to the body. It takes time. Lots of time.
As someone who had a stroke, I would like to tell you that your friends recovery can be frustrating for both of you.. She will need encouragement and yes, you'll have days where you have to push her harder than others and it will seem as if she is backsliding. Other days will be better for her. The best thing I can recommend, is to try to help her find as much humor in as many situations as you can. I've learned through many medical crises that laughter really does help your body to heal. It is better to laugh than to cry. Good luck."
567e3c20,How is bore and stroke in an engine fixed? Based on what factors are they calculated? Is it power?,"The most basic parameters usually given for a reciprocating IC engine are Speed(rpm), Power, Brake Specific Fuel Consumption, Thermal Efficiency, Maximum Space available etc. Out of which we chose a compression ratio, maximum permissible temperature and calculate other cycle parameters from say Otto-cycle. From the P-V diagram, you can calculate the fuel air ratio required and the volume. This gives the sizing of the cylinder bore and stroke for an obtained volume. There is a lot of assumptions though, in absence of data it is ok to assume possible values to get a first cut idea."
106309e9,What are bore value and stroke value? On what factor do they depend and how do they affect a bike's performance?,"Bore is the diameter of the piston
Stroke is the length which it sweeps up and down
For a given engine if displacement is kept constant, increased bore means reduced stroke and vice versa.
Here are the things that get affected by a longer stroke :
Longer stroke obviously needs a taller engine, since the crank and cylinder have to be equally tall.
Peak piston speeds are non linearly proportional to stroke length
This means that for longer stroke:
Induction efficency increases across RPMs, thus torque is increased
Rod and pin stresses increase, because the peak acceleration is higher
Piston carries more peak kinetic energy per stroke, so a heavier flywheel is necessary, and vibrations increase.
Peak potential RPM gets reduced, as it gets closer to Pomeroy limits
Piston crown is likely to see much more thermal stress, since the surface area is lessened
Combustion chamber is more oblong, this affects combustion efficiency - it takes longer, since the flame front travels down from the spark plug

In general, for a given displacement, the longest stroke (upto certain limits) gives the maximum BMEP for any chosen RPM. The flip side is that it will also have a lower potential peak RPM, due to material stress on the rod/crank and combustion chamber geometry limitations."
8c76561a,Is excess sugar consumption one of the factors in causing a brain stroke?,"…not necessarily. Brain strokes occur due to brain cell being deprived of oxygen caused by an irregularity of blood flow. This can arise from either a blockage in the form of a blood clot or a vesicular eruption in one of the brain layers.
Any prolonged excess of sugar or salt will cause an imbalance to the brain’s physiology and therefore exhibit itself by or with an ‘abnormal’ behavior."
94e31b64,"If two bike engines have same number of cylinders and same bore and stroke length but have different power and torque characteristics, what are the possible factors responsible for the difference?","Cam timing, valve design, manifold design, exhaust design, fuel and ignition mapping, compression ratio, these are the main factors that’ll determine the characteristics for about 90%."
f92b12a6,What is the stroke risk factor as a possible side effect for Covid-19 vaccines?,"Well the overall risk in having any reaction against this vaccine is 11 in 1 million for any normal vaccine its 25 in a million so this vaccine is twice as safe as other vaccines.
The Stroke group spokes persons recommend that people with a stroke problem should take the vaccine and is passed as been safe. Though if you are taking any anticoagulation medicine they should speak to their doctor first. Though there is in a lot of cases a doctor available at the vaccine centres who the vaccinator will ask if you show any doubts about taking the vaccine"
d6256b02,"What tests should I have, and how often, to monitor my risk factors for developing heart disease and stroke?","Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management using counselling and medicines, as appropriate."
f92781a8,Why does cholesterol increase the risk factor for heart disease and stroke?,"Cholesterol is a type of fat found in many foods that come from animals, such as meat and dairy products. Your liver also makes it. Your body needs some cholesterol, but too much can block your arteries. That's why adults with high cholesterol are more likely to have heart attacks and stroke. Several health conditions, your lifestyle, and your age and family history can increase your risk for heart disease. These are called risk factors. About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Go to my Profile and you can find all about Heart Disease material there..."
0faf7995,Is a long stroke the only factor to produce high torque in a engine? Then if petrol engines had a long connecting rod would they produce same torque as from a diesel engine of the same cc?,"Yes.
Torque = Force X Distance (or Arm)
Force is applied by the products of air-fuel combustion on the effective surface area of the piston and distance is determined by the geometry of the engine. Hypothetically, using petrol on a long stroke geometry will increase the torque, calorific value of petrol being marginally higher than that of diesel (and hence higher 'F').
Practically, rate of combustion of petrol is higher than that of diesel. Consequently, combustion with petrol as fuel will not even be long enough to last a full length of stroke of the piston. This is what limits the length of stroke/ compression ratio of petrol engines in the first place. On the other hand, short stroke length in petrol engines allows them to attain higher rpms as compared to diesel engines, increasing the power output at higher rpms."
a526cbfb,Hearts (organ): How does pulse compare to blood pressure as a risk factor for stroke?,"It is known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for stroke (brain).
You should keep your blood levels around 120/80 mmHg.
Hypertension is diagnosed when someone has pressure 140/90 or more. If lifestyle does not help to lower it, one should try with medications.
Pulse is not precise stroke predictor. We know that higher pulse on long term can be harmful for heart muscle cause it can cause tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy. It is recommended to keep it less than 75."
8d277d00,Which factor causes the first stroke of engine?,"?????
A valve opens to admit air & fuel into a cylinder as a piston goes down. The valve closes & piston rises to compress the mixture. As piston travels to top of cylinder, a spark is triggered, causing an explosion, pushing piston down. Another valve opens & piston rises, pushing spent mixture out. Cycle repeats."
f9959225,Is it definitely the case that the aim should be to lower LDL cholesterol as it is a risk factor for strokes?,"Is LDL a risk factor for strokes? Saturated fat is associated with a reduced risk of strokes, and is generally believed to increase LDL, and higher LDL is associated with lower mortality in the elderly - which is when most stroke deaths occur.
LDL can be a risk factor for atherosclerotic and thrombotic cardiovascular disease in general, but is not a very strong one, and it seems to be protective for ischaemic stroke..
The reason for this is likely that the LDL count can be raised by divergent processes, some of which are harmful, some of which are not. LDL can participate in reverse cholesterol transport, and elevated levels in this state are less likely to be harmful than the same levels (or even much lower levels) in a state of lipid accumulation due to excess insulin (hyperinsulinaemia).
This is why the TG/HDL ratio, the HDL level, the non-HDL/HDL ratio, and the HOMA-IR test of insulin sensitivity are all considered more reliable predictors of CVD than LDL cholesterol - they give some idea of where any excess cholesterol on LDL is headed. For example, statins lower LDL but are not beneficial, and may even be harmful, in people who already have a high HDL level and high reverse cholesterol transport activity.
Fruits and vegetables are also protective for stroke, probably due to helping prevent deficiencies of vitamins and minerals and supplying some extra antioxidants.
Can dietary saturated fat be beneficial in prevention of
stroke
risk? A meta-analysis."
45f217dd,How does the orientation factor affect two-stroke and four-stroke engines?,
7e1ed93c,What factors contribute to the ratio of gas/oil in 2 stroke engines? Is it oil quality or engine quality?,"Only small engines still use premix today, the ratio is largely made to cover the worst case load and highest temperature the engine may see. Generally it is assumed that basic 2 stroke oil will be used.
In the late ‘60s, Japanese motorcycles started to introduce oil injection pumps that mixed the ratio based on speed and throttle opening, so the ratio varied considerably. That saved oil and also lessened fouling the spark plugs from low speed running. All the large 2 stroke outboards adopted similar oil injection systems, but now Evinrude is the last maker of large 2 stroke outboards. Their system lets you tell it what quality oil you are using and adjusts the ratio to suit.
So to generalize, the load and temperature mostly determines the oil needed, and to a lesser extent so does the oil quality. At the lightest loads the ratio on the old motorcycles may drop to less than 200:1. Premix is often done at 50:1. A modern Evinrude set to use the better synthetic oil probably idles at < 200:1, that is my guess.
Idling 2 stroke dirt bikes that ran premix often fouled the spark plug and were hard to start, the switch to cleaner burning oil as well as oil injection helped a lot. Many 2 strokes today have a moderate but steady load while running with minimal idling time. We also now have stronger ignition systems in everything."
55a2c9c8,What is an important factor for improving the efficiency of a 4-stroke engine?,"There are many types of efficiencies used to characterize the performance of an IC engine, like thermal efficiency, volumetric efficiency etc. However, fo the purpose of this question, I would consider the overall efficiency, that is the efficiency of converting energy from a unit mass of fuel into useful work done at the wheels.
Overall efficiency depends on many factors and pointing out 1 single factor would not be of much use. So listing out a couple of high priority ones
Compression ratio - Increasing CR improves the efficiency of engines.
Mixture control - Adjusting the ratio of air to fuel mass as per engine operating point.
Volumetric efficiency - This denotes the ratio of volume actually available for combustion to the designed volume. Increasing VE improves the ability to extract more energy from fuel combustion.
For improving overall efficiency, there are quite a few techniques like
Valve timing - To contain the right amount of charge within the cylinder for optimum cylinder pressures, temperature and combustion stability.
Injection/Spark timing - To optimize fuel plume temperatures.
Variable compression ratio - This includes a cam operated mechanism to change the effective stroke of the piston, there by varying the compression ratio depending on engine operating point.
HCCI - Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition engines. This is by far the most fascinating and relatively new technology to improve efficiency. Here, we combine the advantages of
homogeneous mixtures like in gasoline engines to improve emissions, flame and combustion control etc.
compression ignition like in diesel engines to increase compression ratio and overall efficiency of engine.
This is not by any means an exhaustive list.
Hope this helps."
bf0b839d,What are controllable risk factors for strokes?,
6cd93454,Is vitamin D3 deficiency a risk factor for stroke?,"Absolutely yes.
Vitamin D is not really a vitamin. Instead, it is a hormone that is needed to activate 1,000 human genes that regulate everything from the immune system to cancer prevention.
One critical factor that vitamin D regulates is levels of inflammation in the body. It is now well established that high cholesterol (one of the fats in the blood ) is not the sole factor in causing clogged arteries (atherosclerosis) and resulting heart attacks and strokes. A necessary piece in the development of plaques in artery walls that clog them is longstanding inflammation in the artery walls. We now know that people with low levels of vitamin D have very high levels of inflammation in the body and are at high risk for clogged arteries. One study looked carefully at people with very severe atherosclerosis (clogged arteries) and found that 71% of them had such low vitamin D levels that they were unmeasurable on lab tests. (see reference 1 below) A large number of strokes are caused by clogged arteries in the important arteries in the neck that feed blood to the brain.
Several studies clearly demonstrate that adequate blood levels of vitamin D are protective against strokes. Those with the highest blood levels have far fewer strokes than those with low levels. (see reference 2 below)
One study evaluating the link between low vitamin D concluded that “Low levels of 25(OH)D (the blood measure of vitamin D) independently predicts fatal strokes, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation is a promising approach in the prevention of strokes.” (see reference 3 below)
A Japanese researcher found that among elderly with low bone density (a common problem with low blood levels of vitamin D in the elderly) had a much higher frequency of stroke, suggesting that they had the same cause ie low vitamin D. (see reference 4 below)

There are many variables that determine an individual’s involvement after a stroke. Strokes can be ischemic or hemorrhagic, and the type of stroke is a predictor of damage to a certain degree. The site of the stroke is also a big determiner in the types and degree of involvement for communication and mobility.
After a stroke, the availability of intense, high quality therapies are predictors in the best possible outcomes for the individual. Ideally, the best therapies are provided by a dedicated team who provide a thorough assessment and create a therapy plan that provides a sequenced multidisciplinary approach to the patient’s needs. Unfortunately, many facilities no longer offer a static team for patients and instead use lots of PRN staffing. While it’s therapy, it doesn’t always follow the scope and sequence as closely as a single provider can. This extends the length of treatment, especially in the area of communication and cognition.
Finally, So many things change in an instant when you have a stroke: your independence, health, ability to care for yourself, livelihood, and relationships all fall under a cloud of doubt. The simple pleasures of life like enjoying a good meal with family or friends may be interrupted. The people who weather the inevitable depression that limits progress are usually those with the highest levels of personal resilience. These are the people who roll with the punches and revel in their small victories. They are the ones who give their all to their therapies on good and bad days. These are the ones who against the odds go home and figure out how to live their lives in a sea of change."

Consistency of food—ice cream Vs steak, for example.
Number of teeth present—generally, the more teeth, more efficient the chewing.
Presence of aberrations in occlusion (how upper and lower teeth come together)

e271135f,"If efficiency is one of the important governing factors in engines, why are 2-stroke engines less efficient but powerful?","Efficiency is a loose term that is used but when it comes to work you have to look at how the power is applied properly. A chainsaw for instance for a weed eater operates by moving its cutting edge very fast at high speed. Where is if you're pulling a load you need a low steady amount of toward at a load of middle-range RPM ran through different gear ratios to pull a heavy load.
A chainsaw main only be three horsepower but it makes that power rating at 10,000 RPM, whereas your standard push mower maybe a 324 horsepower engine but makes it steady at 3600 RPM, balaban thing is that newer gas engines are not being rated in horsepower as they used to be videos of the manufacturers are going to series of engines that have a specific amount of torque. If I read the specifications right the newer engines r rating the power output by the torque at 1900 RPM versus the horsepower at 3600 RPM. And considering that people have been looking at 10 horsepower 11 horsepower 12 horsepower engines for the last hundred years for small engines whatever the horsepower rating and then they decide to change the rating system on the engines oh, and its memory serves it was because somebody sued one of the engine manufacturers and complained that his intention wasn't making for horsepower at 3600 RPM for whatever reason only been making 3.95 horsepower and that person won a lot of money in a lawsuit so now they change their power ratings at least that's the story that I got and I'm pretty much going to agree with that until I hear different. If you've ever watched race cars you can go to a drag race watch a 3000 pound car or a 2500 pound car race to get to five or six or seven second quarter mile elapsed times, then if you go to Indianapolis race car you will see a 1500 pound car making 1500 horsepower pushing that car at a breakneck speed for a long.

The effect on the heart is it has to pump with higher pressure without any (or little) help from the arteries. The dull headache from this increased blood pressure is the number one cause. Number two would be from the high sugar and KetoAcidosis that goes with it. Number three would be that the arteries are starving the area they are supposed to serve of their blood supply and those areas are complaining about it.

061991c0,"How many times will the BHP of an engine increase or decrease if the diameter of the piston increased by 20% and the stroke length is decreased by 20%, with all other factors remaining the same? Can you show your complete calculation?","The BHP of any engine relies upon achieving overall harmony in the combination of a wide array of codependent factors. Harmony in this context implies that scaling any one of these factors - displacement being only 1 - while one or more of the remainder are held constant - may disrupt the success of the entire combination, and thus not be reflected in a correspondingly proportional increase in overall output. As a consequence, it is not possible to predict with any degree of accuracy the BHP effect of any engine simply by somehow plugging into some algorithm the changes you have specified. Of course, the effect upon displacement can be easily calculated (original cylinder area scaled up by 44% x stroke reduced to 80%) = 15.2% increase in displacement. Will this result in a 15.2% increase in BHP? Possibly, but by no means definitely. The increase in displacement is achieved while shortening the stroke, which will result in a lower peak piston speed for a given RPM. While this bodes well for parasitic losses like friction between the piston rings and cylinder walls, and reduced losses due to reduced effects of inertia, the shorter stroke will at the same time reduce the torque produced at a specific RPM as compared with the longer initial stroke length. Additionally, the RPM at which your engine will achieve its peak torque output will increase. While engine designers can make predictions as to how such variables will play off against one another with regard to change in BHP - actual determination is almost certainly a matter for an engine dyno. Unless the increased displacement of your modified engine is supported by a corresponding overcapacity of your carburetor/intake manifold and intake valves ( or fuel injection system) and the flow capability of your intake and exhaust valves, cylinder head passages and exhaust piping system the increased displacement might not produce a proportional - or indeed any increase in BHP at all. If any one of these or other factors is already limiting your BHP, it is conceivable that increasing displacement may have little or no positive effect."

2132628d,"Do you think the Drake Equation misses other significant limiting factors (complex cells, land, oxygen-rich, mastery of fire, language, tools, and mathematics, etc.) and through broad strokes grossly overestimates the final number?","It's important to realise that there’s no estimate here to assess the accuracy of.
The Drake equation is a simple framework for considering factors that limit the number of actively-transmitting civilisations in our galaxy. Some of these factors are well-constrained by observation and others are not. By considering different possible constraints you can predict wildly different civilisation counts. So, no prediction.
In other words, it's perfectly possible that the resolution to the Fermi paradox lies within the framework provided by the Drake equation. One of the terms Drake describes may strongly limit the density of transmitting civilisations below detectable levels.
Nevertheless I think it’s fair to characterise this framework as being very coarse-grained. Given what I've said above this may seem irrelevant, but it is still worth breaking terms like ‘probability of life emerging on a well-situated planet’ down in my opinion since the whole point of the equation is to try and identify the limiting steps.
I have a theory that
the emergence of simple life may be fairly common on such planets, while the move to multicellular life is prohibitively uncommon (there's some evidence for this in the fossil record).
The emergence of higher-order intelligence is inevitable in multi-cellular life and fairly rapid, given enough time, but the emergence of basic civilisation is not.
To elaborate, I think it likely that intelligence arose independently a number of times; certainly creatures such as dolphins and certain apes have developed complex behaviour, and perhaps long ago big-brained dinosaurs may have hunted in packs and communicated. Meanwhile, anatomically modern humans seemed to emerge, learn basic tool use, and then make no substantial progress for tens — hundreds! — of thousands of years. Perhaps it's this key step at which dumb luck comes in?
After achieving civilisation it didn't take much time, really, to reach the ability to send interstellar communications. At no stage did civilisation collapse completely. Low-tech civilisation appears to be resilient (nuclear armed civilisation may not be of course…).
Nonetheless, these omissions from the Drake equation aren't critical since the existing terms fully encompass these issues; it's just that they are bundled up with other factors. I think it's interesting if, say, the small size of one of the equation's elements is down to a more specific issue (especially if some of the more specific items can be constrained empirically), but the equation is still a useful framework for discussion of the Fermi paradox."

CVAs can be caused by clots (ischemic), yessireee, but they can also be caused by bleeds (hemorrhagic). If you have a bleed in your brain causing symptoms of stroke, and you just happen to have some TPA laying around, and you just happen to still be capable of injecting said TPA into your vein to break up a clot you think you have, do you know what happens? The bleed in your brain bleeds faster, and you could bleed out, because TPA works on clots, not bleeds.
So, you’re having stroke symptoms- sided weakness, some pins-and-needles, confusion- is it being caused by a clot or a bleed? Quickly now- guess correctly and quickly, you want to stop this immediately, remember?
Bzzzzzzt! Time’s up and guess what, you can’t know without a CT scan. What? You don’t have a CT scanner at your house? Well now what?! How are you going to stop this immediately without a CT scanner?
You are going to call 911 or whatever your emergency services number is, and let trained, qualified medical professionals do their job and get your clogged or bleeding brain to a hospital as fast as they can. Time is brain functioning in a stroke; we have stretched the golden hour to the golden three hours, but less than one hour is still best.
You will be immediately evaluated while in the ambulance and wheeled directly to radiology for that CT scan. The scan will be read by a neurologist who will determine if there is a bleed- no bleed, you’ll be offered TPA. You say yes, the nurse adds a small bag of clear fluid to your IV. Within minutes, you start to feel less confused, not so groggy. Every minute after that, you ‘clear’ a bit more. You may come all the way back in a matter of hours, there may always be some residual damage, you won’t know until you are on your individual journey.
If the scan showed a bleed, you will be whisked into surgery and the bleed will be stopped if possible- if accessible. Sometimes a transfusion of clotting factors can be given if the bleed cannot be reached. Then, of course, care must be taken there’s not a clot in the brain, too. You may come all the way back in a matter of hours, there may always be some residual damage, you won’t know until you are on your individual journey.

However not everyone with atrial fibrillation requires warfarin prophylaxis. The indication will depend on a score known as the CHADSVASC score. When the score is more than Or equals to two, anticoagulant such as warfarin should be given.
Pleas note that nowadays the use of NOAC is getting more popular and it has largely replaced warfarin in the prevention of embolic stroke in AF patient.

Healthy eating can reduce the risk of stroke
Researchers at Oxford University have investigated the influence of dietary habits on the risk of stroke. The large-scale study shows the importance of healthy eating, but also provides some surprises.
There are two types of stroke. One is ischaemic stroke or brain attack, in which a blood clot cuts off the blood supply to the brain. The other type is the hemorrhagic stroke, also called a brain haemorrhage. This is much less common and therefore less well researched.
""Most early studies look at either the general risk of stroke or stroke. This is partly because cerebral haemorrhages are rather rare in Europe. Many other studies simply don't have the necessary numbers of participants."" Tammy Tong, University of Oxford
The study, which Tammy Tong and her colleagues have now published, has the necessary number of participants. Almost 420,000 people from nine European countries accompanied the physicians for an average of more than twelve years. Such large groups need nutritional physicians to answer the question: What influence does nutrition have on diseases? The new study confirms what research on brain infarction has already shown: People who eat fruit, vegetables and fibre have a lower risk of stroke. Fruits and vegetables contain, among other things, potassium and magnesium, which have a blood pressure-lowering effect.
Red meat is better with high-fibre side dishes
In contrast, another foodstuff is probably not as harmful as assumed, namely red meat, for example from pork, beef or lamb.
The researchers initially found that eating red meat increases the risk of ischaemic stroke. However, this disappeared again when they offset the consumption of fibre and other healthy foods. People who eat a lot of meat probably consume less fibre and therefore have an increased risk. With plenty of fibre-rich vegetables on the side, there is nothing wrong with a steak now and then - at least as far as the risk of stroke is concerned.
Eggs - a mysterious risk factor for cerebral haemorrhage
In the second type of stroke, cerebral haemorrhage, however, the diet with dietary fibres, fruit and vegetables showed no effect. Instead, the researchers found another ""risk food"", namely eggs.
The risk already increases with one third of eggs per day. But according to Tammy Tong, this is initially only a statistical correlation. Cause and effect can only be clarified with further research. Regardless of this, there is already a lot of evidence that fibre, fruit and vegetables are good for your health - not only to prevent a stroke.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
""What is good now and would be protective against stroke, is just as beneficial probably against heart attack, against diabetes, and certainly also against cancer. We are increasingly trying to find a healthy diet that keeps people healthy and fit for a long time and protects them from these modern diseases.

e37e47b6,Does doing math/computation help prevent stroke?,"Because of the umpteen reasons for having a stroke, Sitting down for long periods doing Math/computation would put you up there in the risk category. Thrombosis can occur and a blood clot could break away; making its way to your heart causing a pulmonary embolism. Other smaller clots could carry on and cause a stroke!
If you have ever travelled on a long haul plane flight. The flight crew demonstrate foot, ankle and calf exercises to try to avoid deep vein Thrombosis occurring.
Blood clots can form when you don’t do enough exercise such as a brisk walk daily etc.
Have you ever heard of people who are going away for a month or so and leave their car in the garage while away? Besides asking a neighbour to water their plants, they also ask if they could start the car engine and let it run for a few minutes once or twice a week! because everything liquid (oil/water etc) settles and can clog the works and can lead to complications.
Our bodies work much the same. If your sitting for long periods and the going to bed and repeating this daily routine, your chances of a stroke elevate to a very strong possibility.
Try working standing up and during a set time of each day, go for a brisk walk. Jogging is very good, but! keeping moving is far better than just sitting and working.

db310c6e,Is taking aspirin daily ineffective of preventing strokes?,"We all have an opinion on this. When I want a dependable answer about meds of any kind, I research, and check with the med specialists. Two or more experienced pharmacists. In this matter, one or 2 cardiologists. A baby aspirin daily is reputed to alleviate strokes but that would only be due to the thinning of the blood to reduce clots and/or possible calcification in the blood vessels. However, remember when we first learned too many eggs caused higher cholesterol and then that was disputed? Next it will be determined that it is bad again, then good again? I’m convinced medicine is still very much an art and not strictly a science on a daily basis. If you are a potential stroke patient, if your stomach can handle it, a baby aspirin a day could be a good choice for you. Best to research and see a cardiologist if you have been told you are at risk. It is also very critical to keep your blood pressure in check as this is a definite stroke risk. That much we do know.

2ab805d8,Does learning a new language help prevent strokes?,"No. We wish.
What you may be confusing this with is that there is some evidence that if one has a stroke that damages the language centres of the brain, it may hit one language but not another in a bilingual person. So the person would still have a language left to communicate with. But such cases are actually quite rare. Not all strokes hit the language centres, not all that do happen with bilinguals, and not all that happen with bilinguals affect one language but not the rest.
You may also have heard that people who are bilingual who get dementia get the overt symptoms of it several years later than the average monolingual person. But that is a different case, and the rate of lesions in the brain after death is actually the same, if I remember the facts correctly; e.g. two people both die at age 85 and have the same rate of lesions in the brain, but the monolingual had started showing symptoms at 75 while the bilingual had started showing symptoms at 80. Something about the bilingualism just let the person work around the damage from the lesions for a while.
But no. Please follow advice from your doctor, not your French teacher, if you are considered at risk for strokes."

All of these drugs are anti-clotting/anti-coagulant-types, and will help to prevent an ischemic stroke BUT are not useful in preventing hemmoragic stroke; they actually increase your risk of such a stroke. That said, I know of somebody who had an hemmoragic stroke and was put on warfarin afterwards to prevent another stroke. In short, it’s really complicated! I’d trust your doctor.
TL;DR Probably."

If you are a smoker, stop.
Find out what caused the TIA. It could be due to a heart rhythm problem, or due to narrowing of the arteries, or due to abnormal blood clotting tendencies. Find out the cause and treat it.
Make sure blood pressure is well controlled.
Eating healthy, lifestyle factors, are also important, but most of the stroke prevention advice will be coming from your doctor."
9e4c377a,Can ketamine prevent brain damage due to stroke?,"The is some evidence that ketamine can be neuroprotective, yes, but it isn’t widely used for this for reasons that should be obvious (dissociative, neurotoxic…) Stroke management is tricky because it’s all in the timing – typically a patient loses 1.9 million neurons for every minute the stroke goes untreated (1) and the standard intervention is to restore blood flow as quickly as possible (thrombolysis or thrombectomy). The use of neuroprotective drugs for stroke is a relatively new idea. These drugs prevent apoptosis of neurons by inhibiting the neurotransmitters that send the signal for controlled cell death. They essentially prevent neurons from communicating with each other, thus preventing the signals for apoptosis. Ketamine is purported to have this action too, but the evidence is limited and the adverse effects may outweigh the therapeutic ones.
Ketamine’s neuroprotective method of action is that it stops speading depolarisation. Spreading depolarisation is a normal phenomenon of cellular communication that becomes damaging after an ischemic attack. For instance, an ischemic lesion caused by lack of blood supply to an area of the brain can become larger as spontaneous depolarisations will circle around these lesions, enlarging them with each cycle (3). There is evidence that these damaging depolarisations can be prevented by NMDA receptor antagonists (of which ketamine is one). These are a class of anaesthetics which inhibit NMDA receptors, which when over stimulated can damage cells, so, when antagonised by an an anaesthetic such as ketamine, the excitotoxic effect is reduced. The NMDA receptors will be already stimulated from the initial infarction, and without rapid intervention will initiate damaging depolarisation (and oxygen radicals and pro-apoptotic signals) . Essentially, the mechanism of the NMDA receptor antagonist is to prevent further collateral damage.
Whether ketamine is effective at this is not yet well established, though there is already a patent (4) for ketamine as a stroke treatment. It also mentions co-administration of benzodiazepine, which may be to redude the potential adverse effects of ketamine– it exists in a racemic mixure of R- and S- optical isomers, the R- form has the anaesthetic effect and the S- has the tachychardic, psychoactive and other adverse effects . Benzodiazapines are often administered in combination to redude the adverse effects of the S- form
So in summary, yes, but it certainly isn’t first line treatment. Legal regulations make further research and innovation difficult since ketamine is a controlled substance, so it isn’t likely that research in this area is going to pick up speed, unless a new synthetic analogue is developed instead. Or better yet, someone develops a way to separate the R- from the S- isomers…

79db30c9,How do you prevent atrial fibrillation from causing a stroke?,"Your treatment for atrial fibrillation will depend on a lot of factors and this includes the symptoms you experience, how long have you’ve had it and the underlying cause or triggers of AF.
The primary treatment goals are:
A. Decreasing stroke risk
Experiencing AF and undergoing treatments for AF may put you at risk for developing blood clots in your heart. If these blood clots become dislodged from the heart, and pumped into the blood vessels in the brain, you may suffer with a stroke. Your risk of stroke is determined by risk factors such as:
Congestive Heart Failure
Hypertension
Age (>65yo)
Diabetes
Stroke, or previous transient ischaemic attack (TIA or mini-strokes which fully resolve)
Vascular Disease (such as previous heart attack, peripheral vascular disease)
Sex (Female above 65yo)
These risk factors may be summarized as the CHA2DS2VASc, and your doctors will ask you all these questions above when assessing whether you should be started on anti-coagulant drugs.
Preventing blood clots by using anticoagulants
Your doctor may prescribe anticoagulants or blood-thinning medications. They are:
Warfarin
(Coumadin) is the oldest drug to avoid blood clots. Regular blood monitoring to check levels (INR – International Normalised Ratio) is advised to keep the levels well-controlled.
Apixaban (Eliquis), Dabigatran (Pradaxa), Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and Edoxaban (Lixiana) are termed Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC) and are agents which have been introduced to replace warfarin as good alternatives. The immediate advantage of these are that they can be prescribed without the need for continuous lifelong monitoring, although they have similar effectiveness, and bleeding risks as warfarin. This means that your doctors may offer you these agents as a useful alternative to warfarin.
B. Resetting your heart’s rate and rhythm
This is done through Cardioversion, a method used to reset to normal your heart rate and regular (sinus) rhythm.
A cardio version may be offered depending on how long you’ve had AF and the underlying cause.

Transcript:
Hey guys, Dr. Axe here, founder of Dr. Axe. com and Doctor of Functional Medicine. Today I’m going to be sharing with you my top foods and supplements for overcoming high blood pressure. Believe it or not, blood pressure is something that can be easily balanced out if you follow the steps here that I’m going to talk about in this video. First, let’s talk about what causes high blood pressure. Most of the time when you’re reading online or in the media today, you’re going to see things like excess sodium consumption, emotional stress, poor diet, and lack of exercise. Those are four of the big ones that people say may be causing high blood pressure.
Let’s start off talking about diet. What is the best diet for blood pressure? There are three specific nutrients you want to make sure that you’re getting in your diet if you have high blood pressure. Those include potassium, antioxidants, as well as omega 3 fatty acids. In fact, if I had to throw a fourth one in there I would say magnesium.
If you can add those four nutrients into your diet and eat foods that are high in those substances, you’re going to see your blood pressure really balance out there very quickly. That’s going to be a diet that’s high in fruits, vegetables, sprouted nuts and seeds, and organic, wild caught meats. One of the things you may do after watching this video is go to my site, Dr. Axe. com, do a search for potassium rich foods, magnesium rich foods, and omega 3 rich foods. If you go and look at those food lists, you’ll see things like avocados are packed with magnesium and potassium. Doing guacamole would be great for you or consuming chia seeds or wild caught salmon or other foods like that. Figs are super high in potassium as well. Again, I would go online and look up foods that are really high in potassium, magnesium, omega 3 fatty acids, and antioxidants as well. We have actually all of those top ten lists there on Dr. Axe. com.
That should be diet. Some things you want to avoid, diet wise, when you’re following a healthy blood pressure diet is avoid excess sodium intake. You don’t want to overdo the salt. A little bit of sea salt is fine, but definitely stay away from the processed iodized salt. Really eliminating processed sugar.
Processed sugar will definitely cause your blood pressure to spike. Then, of course, processed and fast foods that contain hydrogenated oils, we know those are inflammatory to the body. That inflammation in the arteries will cause blood pressure to rise and actually will cause high cholesterol as well. Again, you get those foods out, add in those mineral and vitamin rich foods, and you’re going to see immediate results in your blood pressure. Then in terms of the best supplements to naturally treat blood pressure, I want to go over the top ones here. The first one would be fish oil. Fish oil is high in omega 3 fatty acids. Those omega 3 fatty acids, called EPA and DHA, are highly anti inflammatory.
We know that high blood pressure is in part caused by inflammation. If you can start adding in wild caught fish into your diet and taking a good quality fish oil supplement at about 1000 milligrams a day, you will see results very quickly in your blood pressure. The second most important supplement to take for blood pressure is magnesium. Magnesium helps relax your blood vessel walls and improves circulation and reduces stress in your body.
All of those things are benefits of taking magnesium which will naturally lower blood pressure. Typically, you want to take 250 milligrams of magnesium 2 times a day. I recommend a magnesium chelate supplement when you take that. The third supplement you may want to consider taking if you have high blood pressure is Coenzyme Q10. This is absolutely essential as well if you’ve ever taken a cholesterol lowering medication. Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant that supports heart health and circulation. It also acts as an antioxidant. Again, Coenzyme Q10, about 200 milligrams a day is a great supplement for helping blood pressure issues.
The fourth supplement would be garlic. You can actually eat garlic or take garlic extract. Garlic contains allicin as well as other phyotnutrients that kill off bad bacteria in your body and act as antioxidants to help lower blood pressure. You can also use lavender essential oil. Lavender oil has been shown to reduce stress which is one of the major causes of high blood pressure. Typically take about two to four drops of lavender oil, rub it on your neck, and you will see that start to improve your overall blood pressure as well.
Last but not least in lowering blood pressure, I would recommend daily exercise. You don’t have to exercise every day, but just 20 to 30 minutes 3 times a week of exercise can make a huge difference. I recommend checking out interval training like my Burst. Fit program as one of the best ways to get fit fast. Also, just in general, any form of exercise, whether it be weight training, walking, Pilates, barre classes, or even group classes, all of those are effective forms of exercise that help naturally lower your blood pressure. Hey guys, I hope you’ve enjoyed these top tips to naturally lower blood pressure. If you want to learn more, hey you can check out Dr. Axe. com. Simply search high blood pressure.
I’ve got more articles and tips on there as well. Hey guys, this has been Dr. Axe with my top healthy blood pressure tips…"
3cb273a1,Do you think aspirin can prevent a first heart attack or stroke?,"Tricky question——-
What kind of stroke? 80% are ischemic/embolic. ASA can reduce that risk. But it increases the risk of hemorrhagic strokes (the other 20%), and makes them worse when they occur.
In trials involving large numbers of people with normal risks of strokes/heart attacks (the general population), and followed for many years, and then compared to an equal group who did not take ASA—there was a small decrease in ischemic strokes & heart attacks. But there was an increase in hemorrhagic strokes + hemorrhagic events such as GI bleeds.
The ‘experts’ decided that routinely taking daily ASA was not overall beneficial… One reason is that most of those people don’t have anything ASA helps but they all have the risks of the complications.
But, you say, what about people at increased risks of strokes/heart attacks. Well, the biggest group of people in that category are those who have already had at least one stroke or heart attack—and those people are excluded from your question.
There are some people who for some reason are found to have significant carotid stenoses and/or coronary artery blockages during a routine physical exam. But that is unusual. Those things don’t just leap out at you when you see a patient routinely. (There is no highly accurate/easy/cheap/safe screening test, so we don’t do them unless there is a good reason). And those people don’t fit into the clinical trials mentioned above). If we do find somebody who does have significant carotid/coronary disease, and before they have an event, we do use ASA. But we also use statins, B-blockers, regulated exercise, etc. So again they don’t fit with your basic question.
In summary, routine preventative use of ASA has been found to not be wise. But ASA used in a more focused fashion is."
4a06a38c,How do prevent third attack of stroke?,"Regularly take medications
Do regular health check up
Do regular excercises
Maintain a healthy diet
Avoid pressure and tension
Do not involve in risky or danger jobs"
1f73555e,"What are some signs of a coming stroke, and what do you do to prevent it?","I dont know about others, but I had a sign weeks before my stroke. I felt as if my eyes were crossing. I could feel the sensation and run to a mirror, no signs of crossing. I don't even know HOW to cross my eyes! I told my OB doctor but he just blamed it on my eye vessels enlarging due to my pregnancy. Since then I've been told it was a textbook case for clots entering the back part of my brain.
Some people have TIA’s which are HUGE warnings of an impeding stroke. People have stroke like symptoms. Like speech being garbled, eye or mouth muscles drooping.
As far as preventing a stroke. Since there are 2 kinds of stroke, ischemic(clot) or hemorrhagic ( bleeding in your brain) I'm really not qualified to tell you how to prevent them since I had one! My mother died from a hemorrhagic stroke! Her symptoms were a BAD headache with nausea/vomiting. She did have TIA’s where she was incoherent, confused, but my mom was not one to visit doctors! She paid the ultimate price for not seeing her Doctor. So I'd recommend if you have worries, please seek help from your physician!"
9d724c09,Is there any lifestyle (including food) you could have changed to help prevent your stroke? What stroke prevention advice can you offer us seniors?,"Whole-food plant-based diet without refined or processed food, and very little or no oil not only prevents cardiovascular diseases but it can also reverse it. The plant-based diet should not include any animal protein including dairy and eggs. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Director of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Reversal Program at the Cleveland Clinic has actually reversed arterial plaque buildup in his patients by changing the diet, as shown in the angiographic evidence below. Image A is shows the original plaque buildup and image B is after being on a whole-food plant-based diet for 32 months
Such a reversal is unbelievable to most doctors who believe that once you get the disease, only option is to keep taking pills (to manage it), or if the blockage gets severe, the only option is surgery, for example bypass surgery in case of coronary arteries.
You may want to look at my answer to a similar question on Quora for more information here. Ramesh Kakkad's answer to Will atherosclerosis go away if you change your diet?"
9f0d873c,How do prevent heart stroke with diet and lifestyle change?,"What You Can Do to Prevent a Heart Attack
You want what’s best for your heart. And it’s simpler than you might think. These lifestyle changes can help prevent a heart attack and heart disease.
Eat to be your best. Add plenty of fruits and veggies, grains, and foods high in omega-3 fatty acids like fresh tuna or herring to your diet. Cut down on salt, saturated fats, sweets, and red meats. Avoid trans fats and food with “hydrogenated” or “partially hydrogenated” ingredients. Variety in your diet is a good way to get all the nutrients you need.
Take it easy. Find a relaxation method that works for you. Yoga, meditation, dedicated time to unwind after work -- these can help keep your stress levels down. Stressful emotions such as anger and hostility may also lead to heart attack risk, so keep calm and be cool.
Ban smoking. If you never started smoking, that’s perfect! If you already quit, excellent. If you still smoke, stop. Talk to your doctor to find out what method will work best for you. Even people who smoke fewer than five cigarettes a day can have early signs of heart disease. Start now. In just 1 year you can reduce your risk of a heart attack."
ed987f3a,Can nurealink prevent or help with stroke?,
77c59e5b,How should I prevent a heart stroke while exercising in the morning?,"I assume you mean heat stroke?
If you are otherwise healthy, cleared for exercise, and have no medical conditions then heat stroke (a medical emergency) is uncommon. Heat exhaustion is what many people experience.
This is a combination of hot outdoor temperatures, body overheating and dehydration. Execising in shaded areas as much as possible, taking breaks or doing intervals of intensity can help balance things out, and hydrating as much as possible. Being mindful of the outdoor weather and exercising caution as temperatures rise toward the 90s and 100s is good practice. Humid climates also do not allow you to cool down as easy because of how we get rid of heat through sweat. If you find yourself overheating then stop and do not push yourself.
If you do mean a heart attack or stroke, then a combination of a healthy lifestyle, weight loss, and medication if needed or advised by your doctor. Preventing heart and/or stroke AFTER this has happened is a big topic and is best discussed with your doctor or specialist since it is individualized for every person in addition to having the standard medications."
b835dd55,What are things one can do to prevent blood pressure and stroke?,"There are several things that one could do in order to PREVENT them from getting HYPERTENSION (High Blood Pressure) or a STROKE.
The most important thing to keep in mind is to have a healthy lifestyle, which we all forget due to our busy schedules. Well, you must be thinking that this is so basic and nothing new….
Do keep in mind that nowadays people don't stick to the basics.. The basics of maintaining healthy and good lifestyle habits.
Do regular physical activities at least 3–4 times a week which includes some form of cardio workouts. Having a sedentary lifestyle is one of the main cause of people developing these conditions.
2. If you are a smoker, make sure that you somehow manage to quit smoking as it can lead to both hypertension and stroke. There are many more risk factors due to smoking as mentioned in the diagram below…
3. Have a well balanced diet that includes Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats in proper amounts. People who consume high salt containing diets (eg:-fast foods) regularly can have a high chance of getting Hypertension.
Its not that you cannot consume fast foods but it could lead to many diseases when consumed in high amounts.
So please keep that in mind.. Having a cheat meal once a week will not do much harm specially if you are an active person with good lifestyle habits.
4. Sleep deprivation is also know to cause hypertension. So make sure you get enough sleep which may vary from person to person (5 hours to 7 hours). When people are sleep deprived their body cannot regulate stress hormones. When these hormones circulate your body for a long time, this in turn can lead to hypertension.
5. If you have palpitations on and off throughout your day without any reason/while at rest/while you sleep or in simple words if you feel like your heart is beating faster more than normal, then please do a check up with your doctor. There is a condition known as ”ATRIAL FIBRILLATION” where your heart beats faster with an irregular rhythm which could eventually lead to the formation of a blood clot that might travel to your brain through the artery and block the artery that supplies blood to your brain leading to a STROKE.
There are many factors that i haven't mentioned here and i have tried to keep it simple as possible. Well these are the few basics that can actually prevent you from getting hypertension or a stroke in the future. Remember that doing these simple things do matter in the long run..
Well if you are diagnosed with hypertension even the doctor wont immediately prescribe you with medications. Initially the doctor would ask about your lifestyle and advice you to do some modifications and check up with you in months time before starting up with drugs.
Hope you’ll got a general idea about these conditions…"

68e5063b,Is it true that aspirin can prevent brain strokes? Is there any major side effects? What should be the correct dose of aspirin to prevent brain strokes in middle-aged females?,"There is a difference betweeen hemorrhagic
strokes and ischemic
strokes. Ischemic means that a clot (embolus) has cut off the blood supply to a portion of your brain. Since aspirin reduces platelet aggregation, it reduces your likelihood of ischemic stroke.
Hemorrhagic stoke is caused by aspirin.
There is no one-size-fits-all correct dose: Among other factors, it depends on your LDL over HDL ratio, exercise levels, and degree of atherosclerosis; a matter for your doctor to decide, especially following any evidence of stroke."
58897c6a,What can I do to prevent a heart attack or stroke?,"The usual recommendations—avoid tobacco and diabetes, maintain healthy blood pressure and regular exercise—are applicable to everyone and are intended to reduce long-term risk from chronic conditions like atherosclerosis, which often starts in childhood but doesn’t reach the degree of damage necessary to cause a true myocardial infarction (heart attack) until many years later.
A true myocardial infarction in a person in his or her mid-20s is very unusual and suggests either severe premature atherosclerosis (due to very poorly-controlled Type I diabetes or familial hyperlipidemia, for example) or provocation such as ephedrine or cocaine, although coronary vasospasm (cramping of the artery causing temporary blockage of flow) has been found to be a rare cause as well. Spontaneous ventricular dysrhythmias, often the result of abnormal thickness of the cardiac septum (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) can cause collapse and sudden death, and are sometimes referred to as a “heart attack,” but are fortunately rare, especially in women."

What is the best time to take such tablets, early morning or late night?","The choice goes undoubtedly to ecosprin 75 mg, as you have asked for preventive care. But using it for lifetime was taught to old school MBBS, and this concept is rather changing now a days. Younger medical graduates dont prefer its long usage and research in this respect is debatable. But in case you are interested in a much older remedy for the same, the combination of 2 brothers-terminalia arjuna and terminalia chebula would go a very long way. Reserch shows them to be multiple organ protective along with balancing the cholestrol deposition. While arjuna bark is taken as a herbal tea in morning(I am fond of it as it has a very mild fragrance), the chebula is a small dried, fruit which can be chewed any time of the day.Continued use of both of these will make your heart as strong as that of a young one. If you google the research articles associated with these, you will find them a much better choice than aspirin. But, yes, aspirin is otherwise one of my favourite medicines."

c590411b,Is taking aspirin to prevent a stroke a probable risk for a brain hemorrhage?,"First of all, it matters how much aspirin you are talking about, and how often. It’s typically used to thin the blood for the heart. When patients would tell me this, they would say the doctor told me to take and aspirin a day, or a half of an aspirin per day (which breaks the enteric coating and causes stomach issues). Many times, the patients wouldn’t put it on their meds list, because it’s “just” aspirin, I’d look into their eye, and ask if they were taking aspirin. They would ask how I knew; they would have “micro aneurysms”, little microscopic bleeding in the eye.
A standard Aspirin is 325 mg, too much for daily consumption, as is a half 162mg; half of a half aspirin has been the most common dosage for daily use, that’s 81mg, sold as a chewable baby aspirin (my choice) or as the brand Ecotrin.
As for strokes, as you get older, a doctor can turn the end of a stethoscope around to the “Bell” potion and listen to your carotid arteries in your neck, listing for what’s called “Bruit” (brewey), a swooshing sound in your neck, sometimes only in one of the 2 carotids on either side. In the eye, I can see “Holenhorst Plaques”, flat flakes that break off of the cholesterol in your carotids. When I look in, they look like someone is back in your retina with a bright yellow flashlight shining back at me, if the flat side is facing me. If on edge they are harder to see, these can be easily missed. Sometimes, I can press on the eye, and make them flash on and off. It is not a good sign. I send the patients out for an Echo, ultrasound of the carotids.
I tell the patients that they may have an impending stroke to make sure they get in, timely. I had one patient actually have a stroke, while they were doing the procedure. They hit her with some “clot buster” medications and was fine. She was very grateful at her next visit, when she told me the story. I would say ¾ th’s of patients I sent out, ended up having a procedure to remove the clots from their carotid arteries."
dcf7daf3,Guitar: How can I prevent hitting the next string when performing a free stroke?,"You may not be in correct position with your right hand. Fingers pointing down, thumb out from your palm. Curve fingers towards palm. Second joint of finger should be over the string so your fingers are “snapping” back into your palm. In fact, exaggerate that movement to actually hit your palm. Exactly as stated before (and I studied with the Romeros, even their father) the first joint of your fingers should be completely relaxed and actually bend back when you make the free stroke. Keep your hand steady and DO NOT bounce it up and down. If you move to another string, the hand moves proportionately.
My suggestion, as always, is to learn correctly. Find a teacher or local community school and pay for lessons."
4901beb7,What are some life style changes to prevent a stroke and heart attack?,"1- Don’t smoke! Fortunately smoking has been on a decline for years, but there are still far too many people who smoke. This is the number one preventible contributor to strokes and heart attacks
2- Eat a healthy, veggie based diet low in sugar and simple carbohydrates, and full of healthy monounsaturated fats. The PRIDMED study showed that the Meditteranean diet full of nuts and olive oil reduced the risk of heart attacks and strokes
3- Exercise. At least 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise. But also move you body. Even when you are not exercising, stay active. Take the stairs not the elevator. Park far from where you are going so you have to walk more. Don't sit more than 30minutes at a time
4- Get adequate sleep and manage your stress levels. Cortisol and other stress hormones increase with poorly managed stress and lack of sleep and can contributed to increase risk of heart attacks and strokes
5- Monitor your blood pressure and work with your lifestyle to maintain a healthy weight and healthy blood pressure
6- Pick your grand parents well. This one we can’t control. Our genetics cannot be changed (yet). But knowing your family risk can sometimes serve as extra motivation to be more vigilant on the above points."

This results in micro inflammatory reactions throughout the body including within the walls of blood vessels themselves. In turn this can lead to embolus formation and strokes.
This reaction can be so widespread simultaneously within the body that it becomes impossible to manage medically."
1492c0e1,"Would taking blood thinners every so often, after a certain age, be a good preventative method of preventing blood clots, and thereby a preventative measure for a heart attack and stroke; even if one has never suffered a stroke or heart attack?","There are two types of blood thinners: Those that affect the platelets aggregation (e.g. aspirin) and those that effect the other clotting mechanisms (classically warfarin). They prevent different types of clots and have different effects depending on what you are treating. Coronary artery disease and strokes are treated with anti-platelet drugs (to prevent micro-aggregates in the vessels) and clots in the veins and larger vessels are prevented with drugs like warfarin, Eliquis, etc.. Taking aspirin daily (81 mg) daily has been shown to lower the risk of MI and stroke but not the other type of medication."
a9824d54,"Is a stroke painful, or does the clot in the brain prevent you from perceiving/feeling the pain?","The brain lacks pain receptors, so cannot generate pain sensations like your body would with injury.
Involvement of the pain pathways can cause pain, but this is unusual early on, and occurs late after a stroke.
Raised pressure within the skull can cause headaches, this is quite common after large strokes."
aae4acee,"Which is overall better for stroke prevention, Warfarin or Plavix?","Warfarin is, overall, a much stronger blood thinner. (Well, technically, Plavix isn’t a blood thinner. Instead, it works by making it more difficult for the platelets to clot. You know what I mean, though.)
But there are disadvantages to Warfarin as well. For one thing, it is sensitive to what you eat. If you eat a leafy green salad one week and you don’t the next week you’re going to have problems =( You have to get tested every month to make sure you’re taking the right dose, which changes based on your age and your diet. Finally, you bleed constantly while you’re on it. Case in point: I decided to go tubing down the river next to my house right before going to Hawaii for a much-needed vacation. But I didn’t blow up the inner tube enough so my butt bumped down the rocks at the bottom of my river. I was so black and blue that I was afraid my husband might get interrogated at the airport =(
Plavix doesn’t have any of those problems. I mean, sometimes I get bruises that I don’t know the origin of, but that’s the extent of my problems.
Additionally, I’ve been told that for my particular ‘brand’ of stroke (ischemic, from a clot that formed in my heart, we think), Plavix may indeed protect me better than Warfarin."
a11af6d7,How do I protect body from heat stroke?,"Some of the simple preventive measures from the heat stroke are as follows:
1.drink adequate amount of water for every one hour(bcoz water content in our body is 75%).
2.try to drink lemon juice(sharbat;it rinses the internal body parts).
3.don't drink cold water instead prefer warm water,it would be very helpful."
b11445df,How do you prevent brush strokes when painting walls?,"For the “cutting-in”(doing the edging) phase of painting a wall I suggest using a latex/acrylic paint flow additive such as Flotrol. You can buy this additive at most paint stores - labels will sometimes say it is for increasing flow when used in a paint sprayer, however I find it most effective when cutting in. Thinning your cut in paint with this will not affect the color of the paint(unless you put way too much in) and you will have more control of the paint which will dry slower and self-level better so that brush marks won’t show so much.
Another tip is to lower the air temperature and increase humidity where you are painting if possible. (Not too cold or humid or you may have issues with paint runs if you apply the paint too thickly) Just turn on the air conditioning, and minimize air movement, ie. overhead fans so your paint doesn’t get too dried up in your cut pail. Painting in a warmer and drier environment will make the paint “rope”(a term used by pro painters) and it will become thick with less viscosity and much more difficult to prevent these brush marks. Of course sometimes you cannot prevent dry/warm painting environments. Many of the construction sites me and my crews work on are like this - so as mentioned above, we always keep a flow additive on hand to help keep the paint flowing better. This also increases efficiency since tacky paint slows down the cut in process.
Final tip is to consider using the newer waterborne - alkyd paints - these are designed often to mimic old oil based coatings. In most residential applications you would not use it on walls, however it is suitable for trim, doors, and cabinets. It takes a little more care to paint with to avoid drips, however it tends to self-level well and will help you avoid ugly brush marks in the paint and leave a smooth looking finish. (not to mention it is more durable when fully cured)"
e20383bf,How do people in their 50s+ prevent heart attacks and/or stroke and increase longevity?,"If a 50+ person does not yet have high blood pressure they are already at reasonably low risk for heart attack and stroke and an ongoing low stress healthy lifestyle and diet should maintain that low risk prognosis. However, a daily supplement of magnesium-L-threonate and vitamins D, B6, B12 and folic acid might also be beneficial.
The level of plasma total homocysteine in the blood is a biomarker for increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Maintaining a fasting level of less than 10 micromoles per liter for that biomarker would be the objective for achieving longevity and minimizing the risk of heart attack and stroke."
4b1bb428,Is Atorvastatin really effective in preventing heart attacks and strokes?,"Research has shown that there are several groups of patients that have a reduced risk of strokes and heart attacks. That is NOT the same as preventing them in everybody.

(1) People with very high LDL cholesterols; these are usually genetic and have an incidence of about 1:500)
(2) People with diabetes
(3) People with prior heat attacks or ischemic strokes.
Their benefit on the unselected general population is not zero, but is rather small. It is not recommended that they be put in the drinking water."
984df082,Do you think that lowering blood pressure is really beneficial and can prevent heart attacks and strokes?,"Yes blood pressure control is that important and it is not a matter of what I think because what really matters is the objective evidence.
Good studies have clearly demonstrated the health benefits of blood pressure control. The benefits are incremental for the degree of control.
BUT: Blood pressure control takes a serious commitment to life style change beyond taking some pills. Just taking meds is not going to work that well if life style change is ignored.
Sleep - Food (Alcohol) - Stress - Exercise - are the big topics.
Finally Medical follow through is essential to monitor and assist the person committed to being well.

244bcc17,Can I help prevent a stroke if I invert my body 5 minutes a day to increase blood flow to my brain?,"No, inverting your body increases hydrostatic pressure and impedes venous return of the blood back to the heart. That is why your face becomes engorged with blood.
There are numerous causes of stroke, ranging from ischemic or lack of blood flow to thrombotic/ embolic, development of blockage / launching of a blood clot.
Let’s assume you are trying to prevent an ischemic stroke. The trouble is, anytime throughout the day where your blood pressure drops low enough that a certain area of your brain is unable to get blood flow, you are at risk for developing stroke symptoms. The longer that goes on, the higher the risk and more severe the symptoms.
So even if hanging upside down helped decrease the risk of stroke while you were inverted, the risk would return when you sat up or became upright again and your blood pressure adjusts.
I hope this helps!"
3c4f1add,Why do people have strokes and how can they be prevented?,"People have strokes because the blood supply to part of their brain has been interrupted. There are two basic types, ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes occur when the blood flow is blocked, perhaps by a blood clot. Hemorrhagic strokes occur from bleeding into the brain from a ruptured or damaged vessel. There are many causes; everything from uncontrolled blood pressure to diabetes to atherosclerosis, obesity, and old age puts you at risk. There are no known preventatives, but you can control some of your risk factors. Keep up with your health screenings, maintain a health weight, check your blood pressure and sugars regularly, get enough exercise, and eat a healthy diet. These are the best we have to offer as preventatives."

79c7446a,How do you prevent heat stroke in dogs?,"Keep your dog inside with the air conditioner on. Walk your dog early in the morning and late in the evening. Check the pavement by touching it with your hand. If it is hot to the touch it is too hot for your dog to walk on.
If your dog is getting overheated place his or her paws in cool water (not ice water). We learned this trick from our vet. After a hurricane left us without power for 2 weeks I was concerned about our 3 dogs (and 1 cat) getting dangerously overheated. Another trick we used during this time was to fill a cooler with ice. We placed wet bath towels in the cooler. Then we placed these towels on our dog’s backs, our cat too but she wouldn’t leave it on - the dogs left it on. If you have a smaller dog(s) use a hand towel or wash cloth instead. We kept extra towels in the cooler and rotated them."

PCOD may not be serious in all women having it, as the world’s one-third women population suffers from the same. it is observed, many women with PCOD, live a healthy life, as they do not notice any signs and complications. With dietary control, medication and exercise, PCOD can be effectively treated.
However, PCOS is more alarming (than PCOD) and has shown an increased risk of strokes in later life. The major contributor to stroke is increased BMI.
It is difficult to estimate the duration of developing the condition of brain stroke in PCOD/PCOS cases, as many factors determine the same, e.g. BMI, age, the severity of the condition, preexisting diseases (cardiac disease, diabetes), etc.
Prevention:
Keep a watch on your weight and BMI (it is the actual culprit). Follow a strict routine of diet, exercise, and medication, as advised by the doctor. Go for regular health screening to assess your health condition."

How do you prevent buildings from severe corona discharge of lightning?,"Negative ions available in the atmosphere are due to ionization of different salt available on the earth's surface specifically from the seawater during the vaporizing process in warm weather. These negative ions together with water vapor being lighter rises high in the sky forming clouds in the cool atmosphere in top of the sky. When the deposited negative ions increases in the cloud electrical discharge start from atmospheric origin between cloud and earth consisting of one or more strokes. A downward flash consists of the first impulse which can be followed by subsequent impulses. This impulse is as high as may be in the tune of 200KA current and with a duration of less than 2 ms. And long stroke with a duration longer than 2 ms. This enormous current strike may be on protruding structures, trees, or buildings through which it goes to earth. Lightning affecting structure can cause damage/ fire /electric shock to the structure itself and to its occupants and contents including failure of the internal system.
These buildings or structures can be protected by providing Lightning Protection System ( LPL ), Generally, the system has Air termination system, using metallic elements such as rod, mesh conductor or catenary wires intend to intercept lightning flashes. This lighting current is to be passed through a down conductor to earth termination system ( earth pit ) which intended to conduct and disperse lightning current into the earth.

ba1c42f2,What is the effective single-stroke remedy to prevent corruption in India?,"Corruption is in the blood of people. No single strock can annihilate corruption untill and unless we stop favouratism, grid to get rich, giving ghosh to get our job done.
Still I would suggest , To bring corruption to an end
1 if we can bring down cost of living to a substancial amount ,
2. Each and every government department to be connected to sattelite broadcast channel where in each and every task to be done by the govt machinary is displayed and those task are made time bound. These channels to be accessible to each citizen.
3 Make all sorts of elections to be held on single month of the year be it rajya sabha or gaon panchayat or lok sabha. And political leaders to be allowed to campaign only on public platform like government promoted television channels.
4 Rule book should not have loop holes and they should be simple and available on public platform so that any individual can access them and get to know the procedures to be followed.
5 There has to be one school for politicians , whoever wants to become politicians irrespective of their education background to be allowed admission through initial screening test and then join about minimum 2 years course to learning indian politics, moral code of conducts etc following old vedic system of educations. Once passed from that school only be allowed to join student political wings and then politics.
I guess these are few points I have jotted down to irradicate corruption from India

f15f8530,"What are ways to prevent a stroke? A friend's father recently had one, and it has me thinking, I don't want that to happen to me.","Taking care of you! Dont eat more then the recommended amount of carbs, this should keep your cholesterol in check as well.
Exercise. Not exercise once in a while, exercise regularly.
Listen to what your body is telling you.
Talk to you doctor about taking a baby aspirin everyday.
Sometimes, you do everything right and still have a stroke. Chiropractic neck manipulation, unknown clotting disorder (me), whack your head etc.
Give yourself the best chance, be aware what you eat, keep your weight healthy, exercise.
This is also the recipe to keep your heart healthy, keep your mobility with arthritis, avoid all the “poor lifestyle” diseases.

a505bb0f,What precautions should one take to prevent more mini strokes in the future?,
47c0eb1e,Is there any type of device on the market today that will warn a gardener to get inside the house and stop their activity to prevent heat stroke?,"Yes. A thermometer.
Heat stroke is the result of 'denaturing' proteins (in the brain) with heat.
What's a 'denatured' protein? I'm sure you've seen an example. Proteins are strings of amino acids. They have very specific shapes because the electrical charges on some of the amino acids, and links among other amino acids pull them into the shape that they must keep, if they are going to do their job. One protein you've seen many times is albumin. It's made by many animals. The one that chickens make is often called egg 'white'. If it were fertilized, that albumin would be converted into lungs, beak, etc. But a non-fertilized egg can be heated until the albumin denatures. In its denatured state it's solid…a hard (boiled) egg.
A human who suffers central temperatures > 107–108 F undergoes far less denaturation than a boiled egg, but it can be enough to make the cells of our most demanding organ (brain) fail. If a little fails, you'd call it a stroke. If enough, it causes death. That is how kids left in a car on a sunny day die. Interestingly, despite every parent's fear, very few infections can cause enough temperature rise to risk this. Exceptions include malaria and dengue.
Heat exhaustion is just enough malfunction to cause tiredness, but not enough for a stroke. But sometimes people pass from one to the next because the central temperature isn't lowered soon enough.
The elderly, and people with spinal cord defects are more vulnerable to heat injury because their autonomic nervous system is less reliable. That is the system that shunts blood (flushing and pale-ness) and controls sweating. When they overheat, it's harder to restore a normal temperature without much lower temperature (air or water) around them. Even in a fit, young adult, malfunction of the autonomic nervous system is sometimes a hint (to others) that a person is in trouble: when they should be flushed and sweating, instead they are pale and dry.
Sweating, resting, and other methods help lower temperature, but strong-willed people sometimes don't use them. If an oral temperature is above 100.5 F, it's not normal. The higher it goes, the closer you are to a denatured brain."
c6433a84,How can I prevent a stroke in my early 50s without altering my lifestyle significantly?,"I don’t believe that would be at all possible. There are two kinds of strokes. Hemorrhagic and Ischemic. As with
heart disease and cancer, genetics play a huge part in whether you suffer a stroke or not.
As with all things health-related, lifestyle choices are the only way you can help prevent heart disease, cancer, and strokes. Eat a healthy diet, exercise, refrain from the use of illicit drugs, smoking, and overindulging alcohol and have regular physical exams. Even with all of those good things, there are no guarantees in life. You can only do your part in the management of your own health!"

Do you have a study or medical guideline that suggests it to be true?
Second, the use of aspirin for primary prevention of heart issues is rather dubious itself. At best you'll find that multiple studies contradict each other on if there is an actual benefit, and then if the benefit is worth the risk. Major heart health guidelines (AHA/ACC, JNC) don't recommend aspirin for primary prevention of heart disease or incident.
Third, there have been two recent studies which unexpectedly found an increase in cancer risk among aspirin users. Now, both of these studies say that they feel this is an anomaly in the data, but it is part of the current literature.

Power stroke is the most important and only working stroke in four stroke engine."
bc79ff5c,"When you turn off the engine of a car, at what position does the piston in the internal combustion engine stop in relation to a four-stroke cycle?","Let’s take 4 cycle, 4 cylinder in-line engine. The crank throws are arranged such that pistons 1-4 and pistons 2–3 move in the same direction, ie both pistons 1 and 4 move up and down together; and pistons 2–3 similarly move up and down together. In such a configuration firing order could be one of either 1–2–4–3 or 1–3–4–2.
Now this means that before firing, piston 1 would be moving up towards TDC approaching the end of the compression stroke, and piston 4 would be approaching TDC at the end of the exhaust stroke. After ignition has occured in cylinder 1, it and piston 4 will be moving down to BDC while pistons 2–3 will be moving up to TDC, one of them approaching the end of the compression stroke and the other, the end of the exhaust stroke.
When you turn off the engine no more power strokes are left and the engine will slow down and eventually stop. The slowing forces are friction and the compression pressure acting on whichever piston is approaching TDC at the end of the compression stroke, since switching off the engine does not stop it from taking in air and compressing it. Of the two forces slowing down the engine, compression pressure is the more prevalent and the engine will tend to stop around two positions that can be viewed on the flywheel as diametrically opposite each other. When you dismantle the flywheel of an engine that has been running for a long time, these two diametrically opposed positions can be seen easily by teeth that have been worn with respect to the teeth at other positions of the starter ring gear; because these positions are where the engine has stopped and the starter motor pinion has to clash against. Of course this position is not an exact point but rather a range.
If a starter motor begins to slip when one is trying to start the engine, a garage, for a relatively cheap fix, would take out the ring gear, rotate it slightly around the flywheel and assemble it again in a new position so that fresh, relatively less worn teeth come into contact with the pinion during starting."
c9668ba4,Why were most diesel engines 2 stroke until relatively recently?,"In the US, the large diesel manufacturers are Caterpillar, Detroit Diesel, Cummins and Perkins.
There are many others -John Deere, Case and some others…
Of all of those manufacturers ONLY Detroit Diesel engines were 2 stroke, all others were 4 stroke. Detroit has also stopped manufacturing 2-strokes.
However, their engines will run reliably for quite a few more years.
They were used in every application imaginable - trucks, boats, locomotives, pumps, generators, excavators, cranes, buses, farm equipment, pavers - you name it and Detroit had an engine for you!
Detroits were all sleeved engines meaning their cylinder bores were not a part of the actual engine block but rather a large “tin can” open at both ends which are inserted into the block - the pistons moved inside of , and wore, the sleeve’s internal metal surface rather than a part of the actual metal block casting.
After 10,000 or more operating hours the engine would be tired and it was time for a rebuild - “put in the kit” was the trade term - new sleeves, new pistons and rings, connecting rods, reground crankshaft with fitted bearings, new cam bearings, seals, gaskets, etc., etc, …..when you were finished you had an engine back within “factory new specs” ready for another 10, 000+ hours of operation.
Detroits were manufactured in a number of series - 53, 71, 92 and 149 - and a number of different cylinder configurations 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16. The series was the cubic inch displacement of each cylinder - a 71 series engine had a 71 cubic inch displacement for each cylinder - for example, a 6–71 had 6 cylinders each with 71 cubic inches for a total displacement of 426 cubic inches.
Many parts would interchange within the series - for example a 6–71 head would fit a 12–71, a 3–53 head would fit a 6–53, etc.
They were heavy, simple, incredibly reliable, almost indestructible engines which were noisy, dirty by today’s standards, and always leaked oil.
It was said if you had Detroits in your boat and there was NOT oil in your bilge water - something was definitely wrong."
32e914e9,"I have a friend that counts everything word related. He counts syllables in a word, words in a sentence, the number of pen strokes to write a word, and more ways than I can relay. Is this a form of OCD?","It very likely is, although only a medical professional is qualified to diagnose it. Lindsey’s answer provides some excellent insight. Someone with OCD feels a compulsion to do those activities. It’s not a choice. Many people with OCD—and I know one personally—feel that if they don’t perform a specific routine, something “bad” will happen. It’s an overwhelming sense of dread. Often that dread involves others, such as parents. “If I don’t do this, something terrible will happen to my parents,” for example.
Now, that’s not always present in OCD, but it seems to be pretty common.
OCD often is a co-existing condition with others, such as ADHD or Asperger’s (which fairly recently was redefined as a variation of autism . . . though, from personal observation, I don’t agree.). That’s not always the case, but if your friend also has been diagnosed with ADHD, it wouldn’t be terribly surprising if he also had OCD.
On the other hand, your friend’s behavior could possibly “just” be a manifestation of autism. I’ve also known people with autism who “deconstruct” things. Sometimes it’s the calendar—what day of the week did a specific day of the week fall on, who was born on a specific date, etc. (Before autism was well known—back in the 1950s—my uncle had that trait/interest.) Sometimes it’s fascination with machinery. It’s possible that your friend is fascinated by deconstructing things having to do with words.
Though I’m not a medical professional, one factor that may help define your friend’s behavior is whether he’s doing it because he’s fascinated/interested in what he’s doing (autism), or whether he’s doing it because he feels forced to, and that bad things might happen if he doesn’t (OCD)."
e9363955,Is there any relation between stroke length and piston length?,"I’m not actually aware of any strict engineering rules about this ratio but it wouldn’t surprise me to find out there are some engineering guidelines. Of course under any circumstances the piston length has to be long enough to keep the piston straight in the bore. I would also find it likely that the main influence on piston length if the bore diameter. Imagine, if you had a piston length of 1/2 an inch and a piston bore of 6 inches, what would happen. It wouldn’t be pretty."
ed51eae3,What is the difference between a 2-stroke engine and a 4-stroke engine in relation to performance?,"In performance vise a 2stroker is more potent.
As the name says a 2stroker engine just needs an up and down motion of the piston (stroking) two times to convey a power cycle to the crank ( a rotational mtion here) whilst a 4 stroke engine needs the piston to move four times (suction-compression-power-exhaust) to deliver a power rotation of the crank.
And secondly there is no burden of weight in 2strokers as it will not need any valve arrangement or any other bullcrap a 4joke would house hence a stroker is much lighter (lighter means less weight and more speed)
In theory a 500cc 2stroke engine can produce the same performane as a 1000cc 4stroke would.
The Grand Prix motorcycle racing
now is dominated with 800cc 4stroke bikes which was orginally ruled by 500cc 2strokes untill 2000.

0895c1e1,"If I donate my kidney to a relative, and they have a stroke relatively soon thereafter and dies at the hospital, can they return my kidney?","NO! And you would not want it back after it has been in another person’s body!
Transplant surgery is pretty routine now, but someone who has renal failure and needs a transplant has likely been exposed to quite a few medications and run the risk of infections that healthy people’s immune systems manage easily - but immunosupression means their immune system isn’t doing the job. If it were, the kidney they received from you with your unique protein signature would be recognized as an invasive protein and attacked by the immune system.
When the kidney was in you, that kidney was familiar to your immune system because it was made of the same proteins. After transplanting, the kidney is exposed to another person’s immune system…..and many of the similar - but not exact - proteins in your transplanted kidney signal “FOREIGN” to the transplant recipient’s immune system. In order to mute the immune reaction, we use immunosuppresive drugs. And the kidney slowly gets attacked by a weakened immune reaction - and the recipient may harbor a low grade fungal infection, or low grade bacterial infections due to the immune suppression. Do you really want a kidney that has been degraded, has been exposed to foreign proteins & possibly foreign infections just so “your” kidney is back in your body? Heck, the technique for implantation is not to put it back exactly where it came from (protected by the floating ribs of the back) but just above your bladder in your lower abdomen.

0b6b072c,What are some stroke-related small techniques that Olympic swimmers use to go faster?,"Most advanced stroke techniques are highly contextual depending on where you are in your development as a swimmer.
Just because a gold medalist does something doesn’t mean that it’s a good thing that everyone should be doing.
A gallop-style of swimming freestyle is great for some people, but it doesn’t work for everyone. Not everyone is the same: The Gallop Swim
Stroke
: Is it Faster? Should You Consider It?
There are several different freestyle styles you can try, see if you can find one that helps you the most.
You mention butterfly kick off backstroke starts and turns as well.
Notice Missy Franklin’s nose. She wears a nose clip for backstroke. The big problem with backstroke underwaters is that you have to constantly blow air out your nose or you’ll get water up your nose. If you don’t like nose clips you have to have huge lungs to really work it.
In generally for swimming in a pool, some things I’ve noticed that give me a particular advantage:
Turns. I worked on turns exclusively for a 2 weeks. You can make up body lengths on a turn. The flip needs to be fast, you can’t linger on the wall and you have to push off HARD. You need to have a great streamline and a quality butterfly kick as well.

Some tips on improving your turn are here: Bart Loews's answer to What's the best technique to do a pro stylish-like turn while swimming laps?

To really get a good push off, though, you need to build up those leg muscles with squats, deadlifts, explosive calf extensions and plyometrics.
Feel the water. With every stroke you need to feel what you’re doing in the water and maximize propulsion while minimizing drag. When you put your hand in the water the goal should be to treat it like a ladder. If you’re doing it right your body should be moving by your hand rather than your hand moving down your body. Ideally your hand will stay in the same place in the water as when it entered, but obviously, even with a paddle, that’s not possible.

Feel the water around your hands and move in such a way to move more of it.
Undulation and rotation. Backstroke and freestyle are vertical axis strokes while butterfly and breaststroke are undulating strokes. The undulation helps you move through the water, but don’t overdo it on the butterfly and don’t underdo it on the breaststroke. Most new swimmers have waaaaay too much awkward undulation and they also swim very flat in the breaststroke. Due to the nature of the stroke you can sneak in an upward butterfly kick in the breaststroke and not get called on it 99% of the time.

Freestyle and backstroke have natural side to side rotation which are beneficial to getting the most out of your stroke extension. This is another example of a gold medalist doing something different that probably won’t work for most people. Katinka Hosszú destroyed the competition in backstroke but swims with a relatively flat stroke. Don’t try to do this, it’s not good for most swimmers, you won’t get enough extension on your pulls.
Extensions. Fully extend at the end of your strokes. In freestyle you should be making a significant splash as you flick your wrist at the end of your stroke. When you first start doing this your forearms will probably feel it. You’ll be surprised how much faster you go when you start extending before the recovery.

In breaststroke it’s essential to use your kick as a platform to throw yourself forward, there’s less extension in breaststroke than the other strokes, obviously.
Butterfly kick during underwaters. Underwater butterfly kick is the best thing since sliced bread. Get good at this. Every turn should take you out past the flags. That said, the effectiveness of butterfly kick varies from person to person and depends a lot on your body composition and the speed of it is vastly overstated — it’s mainly effective because it’s used on the starts and turns, the parts of your race where you’re already moving your fastest.
Kicks. A lot of people when they learn to swim try to make as big a splash as possible. They do this by bending their legs and feet. Bending your legs is the best way to stop yourself in the water. Don’t do this. Don’t bend your knees, point your toes and kick from your hips (in everything but breaststroke). In any event under a 200 (even sometimes the 200) kick is essential to keep your body high in the water. 200 and more you don’t want to kick as much, keep a regular, slow, but powerful kick to keep your legs elevated, but kicking is so draining that over a long distance the cost benefit doesn’t exist to keep kicking so hard…only kick enough to keep your legs from dragging.
In the end, unless there’s something obviously wrong with your stroke, I wouldn’t mess with it too much. Play around with things in practice and talk to lots of coaches, everyone has different insights. The key is to find someone and something that helps you — not to necessarily just copy something that made someone else successful.
Most of my advice works for the average person, Olympians are not average and are successful because they’ve found things that work for them."

98755f4f,"What is the best natural therapy to treat my chronic constipation, which I believe maybe related to my stroke or depression?","This may seem counter-intuitive, but walking more can seriously improve bowel motility. Walking helps tone all kinds of muscles, gently improves circulation of blood to places like the bowels, which are really just a looong, extended sphincter muscle lined with a layer of tissue that absorbs nutrients as this muscle pushes food through the bowels.
And getting little more daily exercise by walking is most often doctor-recommended after health problems like strokes. (Assuming you're already bring treated by a doctor for that.) Walking is very “natural,"" and unless you have joint problems or are extremely overweight, most can add it to their life without great difficulty. Just try parking in the boonies every time you go shopping or to work, it'll add walking without dramatically altering your routine. If you have those problems (bad joints or obesity), you should find a heated pool where you can walk in water regularly, or do gentle water-aerobics. The water helps ease joint pressure & movements, yet adds gentle resistance. You should notice an improvement in the first two weeks of daily walks.
Between that and any physical therapy you've been prescribed (?) for your stroke recovery, you should be improving fairly well. You can increase your fiber intake as well by substituting high fiber oatmeal (or whole oats) for breakfast toast or cereals. I also like having a quarter cup (or more) of Kashi Berry Fruitful cold cereal for my daily afternoon or tv snack. Just a small amount of this tasty treat can double your daily fiber intake. If you don't like that cereal, keep trying others, there's bound to be one you'll like.
If you like to cook, Fiber One cereals used to print a recipe for banana nut muffins made with their cereal which I found yummy to eat — I couldn't stop myself and my ex-husband from scarfing them down. He normally didn't like bran muffins from a bakery, either. I think their website still has the recipe, but I've not figured out how to include links in my answers yet, sorry.
Please note I don't work for Kashi or Fiber One cereals, I just like those best myself. And I've had doctors suggest this walking to me for this problem and tried it when laxatives, stool softeners, and enemas didn't work great for me; the doctors were right. Walking is the “miracle cure” we often ignore hoping medical sciences can offer better, but you really just can't top it."
88dea374,Why do most passenger car engines have a long stroke relative to their bore?,"An under-square engine, that is, having a smaller bore than stroke allows more leverage to the crank and results in a lower revving, torquey engine. Since most people are economy minded, they drive and accelerate slower, so power is not paramount to the majority. This why manufactures do not advertise the hp of their models on prime advertisements except for the sporty performance cars they make. What is important is the gas mileage, the creature comforts and safety features of their best sellers.
Trucks need towing and load hauling capability, and a torquey low speed engine is just the ticket. It’ll last much longer than a high rpm engine since it’s intended to move a lot of weight from 0 to only low speeds and do it quickly.
Optimum dimensions theoretically are equal bore and stroke. But there is a give and take or compromise to this. Being underquare actually reduces the displacement of the engine thereby aiding in economy and increased engine life; a smaller cylinder will eat less fuel than a larger one.
There is a little known effect a longer stroke engine will have; the noise from each combustion cycle in each cylinder is spread out over a longer time interval, and produces a softer BANG each time on the power stroke, making for a quieter running engine."

1644bc45,Are strokes related to ischemic heart disease?,"Strokes are mostly due to atherosclerosis. Coronary heart disease is due mostly to the same thing. Atherosclerosis is a disease that is multifocal ( touches many arteries at the same time) and can touch any artery in the body.
Now to be succinct, there are other causes for these ischemic accidents besides atherosclerosis e.g. hereditary clotting problem, vasculitis…etc. But the principle stays the same, if it can affect a coronary artery or block it, it can affect too a cerebral artery.
When plaque builds up, the artery’s wall becomes fragile. Now you need to know the the inner layer of a vessel, called endothelium, does not trigger a thrombus formation. The rupture of a plaque exposes the external layers of the wall of an artery to blood, clotting happens, as there is many chemicals that triggers it ( the same happens when you get a wound) and closes the artery further. All colors of the spectrum can be observed, from a completely and acutely blocked artery giving rise to an acute coronary syndrome to a relatively tolerated partial block to an extent, patient is happy when resting and in pain when making effort described as a stable angina.
To conclude, yes!! Strokes and ischemic heart disease are related to the extent that they are a manifestation of the same disease affecting arteries essentially, which is frequently atherosclerosis."
5e4a295d,What percentage of strokes are diet-related?,"We don't have an exact percentage, but it's a safe bet that most strokes are related to diet. According to one study:
Nutrition is far more important in stroke risk than most physcians suppose. Healthy lifestyle choices reduce the risk of stroke by ~80%, and of the factors that increase the risk of stroke, the worst is diet: only ~0.1% of Americans consume a healthy diet, and only 8.3% consume a somewhat healthy diet.
The study goes on to define what a healthy diet is:
A Cretan Mediterranean diet, high in olive oil, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes, and low in cholesterol and saturated fat, can reduce stroke by 40% or more in high-risk patients. The role of the intestinal microbiome in cardiovascular risk is emerging; high levels of toxic metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria from meat (particularly red meat) and egg yolk are renally excreted.

a4747fac,"How are hypertension, heart disease, and stroke related?","High blood pressure causes your blood vessels to thicken and become stiff, which puts stress on the heart and can lead to heart disease. A stroke can occur as a result of failing to treat hypertension, so it is important to be aware of your risk factors and get your blood pressure checked regularly. High blood pressure and stroke High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most significant risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure refers to the pressure inside the arteries. Normal blood pressure is around 120/80, while high-normal blood pressure is 120/80 to 140/90. Desiree Arnold"
ec2bcdc4,Are strokes and heart attacks related to each other?,"Some are, sorta.
The vast % of heart attacks (there are some rare exceptions) are caused by an acute clot formation in a partially blocked heart artery.
80% of strokes are caused by blood clots that form on atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries (the ones in your neck that go to your brain). But the carotid arteries don’t block off; rather the clot breaks loose, goes to a brain artery, and blocks off there.
Occasionally, the clot comes from the heart (atrial fib).
20% of strokes are caused by a blood vessel in the brain rupturing and bleeding into the brain.
So a common theme is atherosclerosis."
8c40caa8,Why do people with bradycardia not intrinsically have hypertension if stroke volume and blood pressure are related?,"Because, fortunately, Mother Nature is cleverer in engineering than we are.
Her solution to this riddle not only protects us from hypertension, but, paradoxically, makes it very difficult for us to control it once we have screwed up her system.
So, let’s start with the logic behind your question:
You have assumed correctly, that, when you compare bradycardia (very low heart rate, HR) with normal heart rate, a higher stroke volume (SV, the volume of blood ejected by the left ventricle with each heart beat) is needed to generate the same amount of blood flow (cardiac output, CO) per minute.
Simply because:
CO = HR x SV (equation 1)
You have also correctly assumed, that the body’s highest priority is on securing blood flow, and that pressure is simply a means to safeguard sufficient flow.
The primacy of flow over pressure is quite obvious: insufficient flow means insufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients, and that creates an immediate emergency for vital organs such as the brain and the heart.
In contrast, elevated blood pressure only becomes a problem after years or decades of hypertension.
At the most basic level the formula that represents this relation is the one that you know already from high school:
Flow = Pressure/Resistance or
Q=P/R (equation 2)
Rearrange this and what you get is
P=Q x R. (equation 3)
In the case of the cardiovascular system flow equals cardiac output.
So now you have
P = HR x SV x R (equation 4).
And here is the first misconception.
The “P” represents the mean arterial pressure (MAP), that is, the average pressure over the heart’s cycles. That is not the pressure that we use to define hypertension. We use systolic and diastolic pressure.
Equation 4 tells you that a lower heart rate (HR) can be compensated by a higher stroke volume (SV) without any change in P, in this case MAP.
Which is a good thing because lower MAP is typically better than higher MAP.
Equation 4 gives you also a hint at something else. There is another player in the game: Resistance. It refers to the resistance that the circulatory system offers to the blood flow.
Aside from resistance, there is one more crucial player: Elastance.
Elastance is the quantity that describes the stiffness of the arteries. Higher elastance means stiffer arteries means higher pressure.
To bring it all together, you need to know that Mother Nature has coupled the heart’s and the arteries’ functions very tightly together. We even have a name for this phenomenon: arterio-ventricular coupling.
The nice thing about this coupling is, that we can pack these relations into some straight forward equations, one of which also answers your question.
equation 5: EA = arterial elastance; Pes = end-systolic pressure; SV = stroke volume
Written in this form it gives the wrong impression that Elastance is determined by Pressure and Stroke Volume.
In reality, it is pressure which is the result of arterial Elastance and Stroke Volume.
Each of those latter two can be affected by aging, disease or deconditioning, but the body also has direct means to regulate them.
So, a better way to represent this is to rearrange the equation to:
In other words, while stroke volume is related to end-systolic pressure, a lower elastance (higher compliance) of the arteries can more than offset its effect.
Which is why athletes, who typically have a lower heart rate but also more “pliable” arteries than non-athletes, do not have hypertension, as your question implies.
There are a lot more parameters which affect blood pressure. Resistance is a very important one. But there are also blood viscosity, arterial diameter and wall thickness, and functional parameters of the heart that all determine blood pressure.
With so many levers to work with, Mother Nature has made it rather difficult for us to understand why somebody’s blood pressure has gotten too high.
Which is why close to 40% of hypertensive patients treated with 3 or more drugs cannot reduce their blood pressure sufficiently.
PS: The above explanation and equations are a simplification of the complexity of blood pressure control. But it helps to grasp the concept and answer the question."
f8f68061,How is the RPM of an actual four stroke gasoline engine related to the number of thermodynamic cycles? What would your answer be for a two-stroke engine?,"I am afraid your question is not fully closed.
A thermodynamic cycle refers to a process where heat is exchanged in order to produce work output. For internal combustion engines the most famous cycles are Diesel and Otto. The first one is widely used with Diesel oil as the medium for combustion and the second cycle use gasoline.
The thermodynamic cycle demands certain changes to take place in order to produce output so lets name these as intake, compression, combustion and exhaust.
A four-Stroke engine will complete one of these processes at the time. Hence, needs to do it on four steps. On the other hand a two stroke engine is able to complete 2 of the above mentioned processes simultaneously hence, complete a cycle in 2 strokes.
At this point I want to make it clear that there is only one thermodynamic cycle. The only relation with the RPM is that for a four stroke engine a full cycle is completed in 720 degrees of crankshaft rotation
while for the two stroke engine it takes 360 degrees.
I Hope this is straightening things up!"

In a 4 stroke cycle engine, the working strokes per minute is equal to the (RPM x the number of cylinders) divided by 2.
The reason that accounts for the difference is the fact that in a 4-stroke cycle cylinder there is a dedicated inlet stroke, and a dedicated exhaust stroke, while in a 2-stroke cycle cylinder the action of reed valves and the participation of fluctuation of crank case pressure allows the intake event to be combined with the power stroke and the exhaust to be combined with the compression stroke."

Race relations have been influenced by bad college theories that under most recent (and worst) iteration came about in the late 90s to early 2000s. These theories were fed to society heavily by about 2010. I explain them in the below. I’ve been fighting these theories for 20 years.
Rudolph Jensen's answer to What is wrong with saying ‘all lives matter’?
These theories linked below this paragraph are sexist and racist. They are leading to massive problems when applied to society that we are seeing right now. Of course, the “woke” crowd doesn’t see it that way. The theories divide people into groups based on race, sex, sexual orientation, and gender then perpetually treat those groups differently. Some are grouped into perpetual oppressors and others perpetual victims. Racism is discriminating against different races based on color of skin. Racism is dynamic and not fixed to a simplistic narrative. Academia has a LOT of power and they teach these theories to others. Those people once taught go into journalism, teaching, activist groups, and politics. Virtue signaling and getting special victim status is intoxicating as it’s a “feel good” narrative and gives power to those pushing the narrative. This type of victimology lead to authoritarianism and hundreds of millions of deaths in the 20th century through Communism and Fascism. You’d think humans would learn but alas they often don’t want to think critically. The number one problem and threat in the Western World now is adherence to these theories.

Stroke
doubles dementia risk, concludes large-scale study
I believe technically a stroke is an ABI, acquired brain injury, not a TBI as there was no external force causing the brain injury. But it clearly is an injury to the brain.
The dementia associated with stroke may also be vascular dementia.
“A meta-analysis [4] of 30 studies
conducted in 2009 established that dementia prevalence in
symptomatic stroke patients increased from 10% before first
stroke to 20% soon after first stroke, and more than a third
had dementia after recurrent stroke. More recently, a metaanalysis
[5] of six studies conducted in 2013 established
that stroke is a moderately strong risk factor for Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) (risk ratio [RR] 5 1.59, 95% CI 5 1.25–2.02).
Taken together, these studies highlight the central causal role
of symptomatic stroke, rather than the underlying vascular
risk factors.”"

That 1 hour time change could affect a lot of things. Our eyesight, adjustment of light, habit, mind, wake/sleep pattern, all of which are interrelated & affect a lot of organs not just for that 1 day but days after that as well.
Studies have found that shift workers when given those 2 regular (normal) days off each week need up to 16 hrs for their bodies to adjust. (Like travellers experiencing jet lag).
According to Chinese medical books (from thousands of yrs ago), our organs work according to our bodies’ circadian & biological rhythms. That circadian clock is divided into 12 2hr periods & each period governs a different organ. In reality we can't live the best life for our organs as we'd have to eat between 3 a m & 5 a m & sleep while we should be working. (I recently heard from a friend that he does have a friend who's practising part of it now).
Once the rhythm is out of whack, it affects everything from our heart, liver, digestive system, sleep, hormones, kidney etc.

I would have thought that both were mutually exclusive. The question concerns a relative, so it is for real. (It has caused a blood clot stroke? ) Thanks.”
Physiologically there’s no reason this can’t happen. Plenty of blood moves even at a slow heart rate, so if the circulatory system has high resistance the blood pressure will go up.
I would wonder, given the question and the mention of blood clot/stroke, whether this was not the cause of the event but the result. When something bad happens in the skull that increases pressure on the brain (intracranial hypertension), there is a response (called the Cushing reflex) that includes high blood pressure and a slow heart rate.

Stem cell-based therapies for ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials
Recently, extensive researches about stem cell-based therapies for ischemic stroke have been published; our review evaluated the efficacy and safety of stem cell-based therapies for ischemic stroke. Our review was registered on PROSPERO (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO), registration number CRD42019135805. Two independent observers searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) for relevant studies up to 31 May 2019. We included clinical trials which compared efficacy outcomes (measured by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin scale (mRS), or Barthel index (BI)) and safety outcomes (such as death and adverse effects) between the stem cell-based therapies and control in ischemic stroke. We performed random effect meta-analysis using Review Manager 5.3. Our review included nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven non-randomized studies (NRSs), involving 740 participants. Stem cell-based therapies were associated with better outcomes measured by NIHSS (mean difference (MD) − 1.63, 95% confidence intervals (CI) − 2.73 to − 0.53, I2 =60%) and BI (MD 14.68, 95% CI 1.12 to 28.24, I2 = 68%) in RCTs, and by BI (MD 6.40, 95% CI 3.14 to 9.65, I2 = 0%) in NRSs. However, the risk of bias was high and the efficacy outcomes of RCTs were high heterogeneity. There was no significant difference in mortality between the stem cell group and the control group. Fever, headache, and recurrent stroke were the most frequently reported adverse effects. Our review shows that stem cell-based therapies can improve the neurological deficits and activities of daily living in patients with ischemic stroke.

Can’t copy pertinent sections from here, but this is interesting:
Steinberg Lab Research: Stem Cells
STEM CELL THERAPY offers enormous promise for the majority of the 795,000 Americans yearly who suffer a stroke yet currently have no pharmacological therapy to promote recovery. Preclinical data from our lab and others have demonstrated that stem cell transplantation can enhance stroke recovery. This has led to major efforts to advance stem cell therapy for stroke to the clinic, including our human neural stem cell (hNSC) product, NR1 cells, which is transitioning to the clinic via a California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM)-funded Disease Team program . Understanding how hNSCs interact with the stroke-injured brain to induce recovery is crucial to maximizing their effectiveness. Once we understand the mechanisms by which transplanted hNSCs exert therapeutic effects, we can exploit their full clinical potential as well as predict and prevent potential side effects. Consequently, we are studying optimal parameters for successful transplantation strategies in rodent models of stroke; these parameters will depend on the cross talk between the graft and the host and will facilitate understanding of the mechanisms underlying cell-enhanced functional recovery. Stroke damage encompasses a wide range of pathologies. The initial vascular damage of stroke triggers a cascade of damaging events that occur days after the initial infarct. The unique advantage of using stem cells for post-stroke recovery lies in the multiple modalities through which they enhance recovery. Our current paradigm is that hNSCs transplanted into the host stroke brain, rather than exerting their effects directly by replacing damaged tissue, secrete factors and interact with the stroke milieu in a manner that stimulates endogenous repair mechanisms that are activated by stroke.

To be blunt, IF we had sane health insurance (See Comprehensive, Constitutional Health Care 2020—Facebook page, group, book), we’d be investigating things like this. It is possible to do legit stem cells for not that huge of a cost and if you can get the body to HEAL instead of playing with bits and pieces of “management” with BigPharma meds, the long costs for rehab, the lost productivity (stroke victim can’t work in many cases; sometimes a family member must take off to care for him…), people would see that something that clearly has merit IS worth trying to help people return to health. Will it work well for everyone? No. Nothing done now does either. Have to run risk/benefit ratio of the big picture which includes quality of life. Under the CCHC plan would NOT be unfair to anyone about costs either.)
We really do need to get the death grip special interests have on medicine OUT of the picture. Legit profit by those with NO medical skills is OK because there IS a business aspect to medicine, but BIR costs are 30% of health care costs and doctors and their staff have their time wasted on BS while hoops are jumped through. We are SO ready for a LOGICAL system.
Would encourage you to reach out to neurologists who are open to stem cells and see what options exist for your loved one. This is NOT “woo-woo” and stroke is too serious and too common to NOT get more attention.
BTW, about PREVENTION of strokes. Absolutely stroke risk is higher for folks with insulin/glucose issues, Vitamin D deficiency, gut health are also tied in. Pinned post here is pertinent:
L.M.'s Random Thoughts
Insulin resistance and risk for stroke
Background and purpose: Resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake by peripheral tissues is a cardinal defect in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance is also common among nondiabetic individuals, and may be an important risk factor for stroke in both populations. The authors review the definition, epidemiology, and treatment of insulin resistance. Methods: The authors searched Medline (1977–2001) and reviewed bibliographies to identify pertinent English-language publications. Results: Insulin resistance is present in most patients with type 2 diabetes. It is also common among elderly persons, certain ethnic groups, and persons with hypertension, obesity, physical deconditioning, and vascular disease. The principal pathophysiologic defect is impaired intracellular signaling in muscle tissue leading to defective glycogen synthesis. Insulin resistance is associated with numerous metabolic, hematologic, and cellular events that promote atherosclerosis and coagulation. The association between insulin resistance and risk for stroke has been examined in four case-control studies and five prospective observational cohort studies. Six of the nine studies are methodologically sound and provide evidence that insulin resistance is associated with risk for stroke. Conclusion: Insulin resistance may be a prevalent risk factor for stroke. New drugs can safely reduce insulin resistance and may have a role in stroke prevention.

7acf3ec2,What are the best strategies for stroke recovery?,"Emergency treatment of stroke
Stroke
treatment
should be done as soon as possible. When the brain vessel is blocked, damage to the brain tissue begins to occur. This damage expands as you wait. When the clogged vessel
is large and the time is longer brain damage increases.
Opening the vein as soon as possible prevents all of them from expanding the damage to the brain tissue. In the brain tissue, the less restricted the damage caused by the stroke, the sooner and faster we can recover. Therefore, rapid treatment means early and quick recovery when it comes to stroke.
Intravascular clot-dissolving drug treatment (Thrombolysis)
It is the intravascular clot-dissolving drug application that can be performed within the first 4.5 hours at the latest after stroke symptoms begin. Its ideal is to do it as soon as possible. This treatment dissolves the clot and helps the blood flow to recover quickly and effectively, thereby improving the stroke.
If the patient's condition is not suitable for the application of this treatment or if the period since the occurrence of stroke has been prolonged, intravenous anticoagulant therapy cannot be performed. Your doctor will resort to other medications and methods in treatment.
Angiographic clot removal treatment (Thrombectomy
)
If the main vessels feeding the brain are clogged with a clot, clot-dissolving medication, intravenous thrombolysis, which is applied through a vein, is not sufficient to dissolve the clot mass in these large vessels. In this case, the primary purpose of the treatment is to find the brain vessel clogged with angio method and remove the clot with select devices. The 'angiographic clot removal treatment' applied in the first 6 hours is so useful that 1 out of 3 patients who are treated ultimately return to their former lives.
One of these two treatment applications is not used as an alternative to the other. On the contrary, it is used as complementary and success enhancing."

Otherwise, for rehab, victims of a stroke have been done a disservice for years. They are told that the fastest recovery of lost abilities comes in the first 3–4 months and that further improvement after 1 year is unlikely. This is not true. What is true is that spontaneous recovery after 1 year is unusual. However, with specific Occupational, Physical and Speech therapies for CVA an improvement can take place at any time. I have worked with people whose stroke was 5 years prior and have seen dramatic improvements in strength, movement, gait and balance. So, no I don’t believe there is a golden time."

Stroke, traumatic injury, and metabolic disorder are major causes of brain damage and permanent disabilities, including motor dysfunction, psychological disorders, memory loss, and more. Current therapy and rehab programs aim to help patients heal, but they often have limited success.

If you are asking for yourself, I'm going to suggest a low-impact class like yoga or tai chi. They work on balance, stretching,n strength conditioning. Yoga can be done in a wheelchair. I used to have a video called ""Chair Yoga.""
If you are a caregiver, this might be too high. Ask the consumer's doctor for a referral to Physical Therapy for YOU to be taught Range of Motion exercises. YOU do these on the consumer, because he or she can't. This is usually forgotten at discharge because the patient doesn't immediately show signs of stiffening.
More can then be done with a total care patient, but they have to be kept functional.
You are going to have to go in n get a referral to be seen. To most this means u have medical Insurance. I’m concerned about the very mild with no insurance. Computer access is easy n ppl try to self-diagnose. For those, enroll in low-cost Parks & Rec n city or college run classes n don’t let anything freeze up. The problems are too various.
It can be done with nothing- no fancy rehab or therapy. The following is a true story. At that time, n maybe even now, Mexico did not have a rehab program. Intensive Brain Remaking.

e284098d,How does neurorehabilitation help with stroke recovery?,"A stroke happens when a vein in the cerebrum breaks and drains, or when there's a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. The break or blockage keeps blood and oxygen from arriving at the cerebrum's tissues.
Without oxygen, synapses and tissue become damaged and start to die within no time. The loss of blood flow to the brain harms tissues inside the cerebrum. Manifestations of a stroke appear in the body parts constrained by the injured part of the brain. The sooner an individual having a stroke gets care, the better their result is probably going to be. Therefore, it's useful to know the indications of a stroke so you can act rapidly.
Stroke manifestations can include:
1. Paralysis
2. Numbness or shortcoming in the arm, face, and leg, particularly on one side of the body
3. Trouble talking or getting discourse
4. Confusion
5. Slurring discourse
6. Vision issues, for example, inconvenience finding in one or the two eyes with vision darkened or obscured, or twofold vision
7. Trouble strolling
8. Loss of parity or coordination
9. Dizziness
10. Severe, unexpected migraine with an obscure reason
Stroke requires immediate medical emergency handling. If you think you or someone else is having a stroke, call the hospital immediately. Prompt treatment is key to preventing the following outcomes:
Brain damage
Long-term disability
Death
Types of stroke:
Strokes fall into three primary classifications: transient ischemic assault (TIA), ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. These classifications are additionally separated into different kinds of strokes, including:
A. Embolic stroke
B. Thrombotic stroke
C. Intracerebral stroke
D. Subarachnoid stroke
The sort of stroke you have influenced your treatment and recovery process.
Cause of stroke:
The reason for a stroke relies upon the sort of stroke. The three primary sorts of stroke are transient ischemic assault (TIA), ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke.
A TIA is brought about by a transitory blockage in an artery that prompts the cerebrum. The blockage, normally blood coagulation, prevents blood from streaming to a specific part of the brain. A TIA ordinarily goes on for a couple of moments up to a couple of hours, and afterward, the blockage moves and bloodstream is reestablished.
Like a TIA, an ischemic stroke is brought about by a blockage in a supply route that prompts the brain. This blockage might be blood coagulation, or it might be brought about by atherosclerosis. With this condition, plaque (a greasy substance) develops on the walls of the blood vessels. A bit of the plaque can break off and stop in a vein, hindering the progression of blood and causing an ischemic stroke.
A hemorrhagic stroke, then again, is brought about by a burst or spilling vein. Blood saturates or around the tissues of the cerebrum, causing pressure and damaging brain cells.
Stroke treatment:
Proper medical treatment and prompt treatment are important to recovering from a stroke. It is said that “Time lost is brain lost.” Call your nearby hospital as soon as you realize you may be having a stroke, or if you suspect that someone is having a stroke.
Treatment for stroke depends on the type of stroke:
Ischemic stroke and TIA
These stroke types are caused by a blood clot or other blockage in the brain. For that reason, they’re largely treated with similar techniques, which include:
• Antiplatelet and anticoagulants
• Clot-breaking drugs
• One such medication, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), or Alteplase IV r-tPA, is viewed as the most significant medication in ischemic stroke treatment. It works by dissolving blood clusters rapidly, whenever conveyed inside the initial 3 to 4.5 hours after indications of your stroke started. Individuals who get a tPA infusion are bound to recover from a stroke, and less inclined to have any enduring handicap because of the stroke.
• Mechanical thrombectomy
• Stents
• Surgery
Hemorrhagic stroke:
Strokes caused by bleeds or leaks in the brain require different treatment strategies. Treatments for hemorrhagic stroke include:
• Medications
Not at all like with an ischemic stroke, in case you're having a hemorrhagic stroke, the treatment objective is to make your blood coagulation. Consequently, you might be offered drugs to neutralize any blood thinners you take.
You may likewise be recommended drugs that can reduce blood pressure, lower the pressure in your brain, prevent seizures, and prevent blood vessel constriction.
• Coiling
• Clamping
• Surgery
In addition to emergency treatment, doctors will advise you on discharge on how to prevent future strokes.
Post-discharge one of the important which helps in recovering the disability is neurorehabilitation.
Neurorehabilitation is a combination of multiple therapies, it takes the help of occupational therapy and physiotherapy with patients and their families to build back the functions and movements of people affected by hemiparetic stroke. The main goal is to get their skills to work at the maximum level, so patients can rebuild self-esteem and a positive attitude towards life. Recovering from a stroke can be a long, almost hopeless process, but with the new adaption skills patients learn, they become empowered and gain the ability for community reintegration.
Neurorehabilitation therapies educate or retrain patients on how to improve or recover their communication and mobility skills, as well as other aspects of their daily lives. In its treatments, neurorehabilitation focuses on the psychological, creative, and nutritional elements of each and every patient's recovery.
Neurorehabilitation should be:-
Holistic approach:
Provide not only physical and cognitive recovery, but also include psychological, social, and cultural aspects of the patient’s personality and those of their family.
Patient-focused:
Health-care strategies customized to the requirement of the patient and their family.
Inclusive:
Developed and implemented by multidisciplinary teams of qualified and motivated therapists or doctors experienced in similar types of collaboration.
Participatory:
Patients and families are actively involved and build a trusting relationship, work together with the team of medical professionals.
Saving:
Help the patient amplify autonomy and decrease physical disability, reliance on portability helps.
Lifelong:
Supports and follow-up carried out from injury onset to the highest possible level of recovery of function, even later in life.
Resolving:
Include adequate resources for efficiently attending to each patient’s difficulties as they arise.
Community-focused:
Discover arrangements that best fit parts of the network and make assets that help the patient in social reintegration.
Key Points of Successful Rehabilitation:
It’s important that patients understand their progress during rehabilitation depends on:
• Starting of rehabilitation on time regarding the therapeutic window
• The severity and area of the brain injury
• Their own attitudes and behavior (daily commitment to exercise)
• The rehabilitation team’s skill and experience
• The cooperation of family and practitioners or therapist
• Successful activation of secondary areas
• Successful activation of contralateral areas
Stroke neurorehabilitation is a progressive and dynamic procedure planned for empowering patients to come to their ideal physical, intellectual, passionate, informative, and socially useful levels.
This strategy for treatment offers various activities to assist patients recover lost motor functions and reduce damage brought about by a stroke. Neurorehabilitation likewise offers deep-rooted help required by patients and their families as they rejoin a network. It permits roused patients to arrive at their definitive objectives of recovering freedom and coming back to typical life."
03e62fb2,What are useful pranayam & asan for mini stroke recovery and healing leg muscle stiffness due to a stroke?,"Stroke is also called CVA - cerebrovascular accident.
It is a damage of the brain due to interruption of it blood vessels.
Symptoms include difficult in walking,speaking or undersatnding. Also numbness of face, arm or leg.
It is a medical emergency.
Once medical treatment is on and conditions under control yogasan and pranayam should be pressed into to improve the inner strenth and immunity.
Pranayam course should be followed first. All the types of pranayaams be adopted one after another based on the improvement in the condition.
High blood pressure is the foremost cause of strokes. Meaning we should start with the ine pranayam type which balance Blood pressure immediately and purifies the nurological network of the body.
‘ANULOM VILOM' performs both the requirment - normalising high blood pressure and purification of nerves
So follow the following order of pranayam: a) anulom vilom ( nadi shodhan ) pranayam. b) kapal bhati,c) bhramari, bhastika and rest be followed after considerable improvement after doctors cosultations.
Now yogasana can be pressed into.
HOW TO DO ANULOM VELOM ( NADI SHIDHAN) PRANAYAM:
Ideally it should be performed while sitiing , spine straight. But under the cinditions patient can di it while laying in bed.
Relax the body and mind as much as possible. Close the right nasal with right hand thumb . Inhale ( just breath in with force you usually inhale) .
Now close left nasal and exhale to with same force ( normal).
Press left nasal and inhale with right nasal ; switch to right nasal ,exhale with left nasal.
This is one cycle. Repeat the cycle for 5 times to increase it gradually with improvement .
Once patient starts feeling at ease and shows interest increase the force of breath little and also length of breath.
This way gradually perform anulom vilom. THIS ALONE HAS CAPACITY TO RECOVER TO THE MOST.
YOGASANA: post stroke 'sookchhama yogasana' ( micro yogas) are advised. Based on the effected parts.
ADVICE:. In addition to pranayam and yogasana soft massage if 'clove Oil' in effected parts is advisable."

0e414fe4,How can augmented video game help in stroke recovery as scientist claims?,"To understand this, let us look at few things.
What is stroke:[1] When blood flow to an area of the brain is cut off then brain cells in that part of the brain don’t get oxygen and they begin to die. Depending on what part of the brain it is, the patient may experience loss in that function like memory or muscle movement.
[2]
What is required by stroke patients to recover: Depending on how severe the stroke is and what part of the brain is affected, the patient might experience difficult in moving arms and legs. In case of minor strokes, the patients recover completely. They normally have to go through physiotherapy by a trained physiotherapist. The problem is that in many cases, there aren’t enough qualified physiotherapist needed for helping patients recover.
[3]
Augmented Video Games: Augmented video games provide virtual reality and proper game program can provide physical exercise for the same muscle groups as is given by a physiotherapist. It can even be tracked and monitored as it is all done by a computer.

This is how augmented video games help with stroke recovery.

f19d7c2c,What role does physical therapy play in stroke recovery?,"Firstly..The types and degrees of disability that follow a stroke depend upon which area of the brain is damaged. Generally, stroke can cause five types of disabilities: paralysis or problems controlling movement; sensory disturbances including pain; problems using or understanding language; problems with thinking and memory; and emotional disturbances.So physical therapy is very important to these people to become able and independent alsoRehabilitation helps stroke survivors relearn skills that are lost when part of the brain is damaged. For example, these skills can include coordinating leg movements in order to walk or carrying out the steps involved in any complex activity. Rehabilitation also teaches survivors new ways of performing tasks to circumvent or compensate for any residual disabilities. Individuals may need to learn how to bathe and dress using only one hand, or how to communicate effectively when their ability to use language has been compromised. There is a strong consensus among rehabilitation experts that the most important element in any rehabilitation program is carefully directed,well-focused, repetitive practice—the same kind of practice used by all people when they learn a new skill, such as playing the piano or pitching a baseball."
43a1e297,Do you think this blog is a helpful guide for fast stroke recovery?,"Medical professionals such as doctors, nurses, and therapists can make only an educated guess of how a person will recover based on the location and severity of the stroke.
It seems to me that the location and severity of the stroke determines what functions are most likely to be affected. That can guide doctors, nurses and therapists as to the types of post-stroke rehabilitation the person may need.
How well an individual recovers is mostly determined by how diligently they participate in the rehab activities and exercises. I’ve seen people, who had terrible functional losses from the stroke, recover so well that if I hadn’t known they’d had a stroke, I never would have guessed.
Speech is one of those areas. People who give up, thinking it is hopeless and the speech therapy exercises are stupid don’t recover very well. Those who keep working at it on their own as well as with therapists recover much better.
The stroke may cause a weakness or paralysis on your body. You should focus on regaining these weakened muscles, so you can get back to your daily activities independently.
Hemiparesis, one sided weakness, is not initially from loss of muscle. Immediately after the stroke, the person may be paralyzed on one side, but with intensive rehab they can regain movement within weeks. Their muscles are probably still as strong as they were before the stroke, but the new neural pathways are not strong. Control over the muscles is weak, not the muscles themselves.
The stroke survivor should focus on using the hemiparetic side as much as possible to maintain their muscle strength and to strengthen the new neural connections that control those muscles."
92a58974,What are new treatment options for stroke recovery for teenage survivors when botox and physiotherapy are not improving mobility or stability?,"I am so sorry to hear about that.
A lot of advancements are being made in the field of nutritional and nutraceutical improvement of brain recovery, neurogenesis, BDNF and NGF release.
This is just a doctrinal summary, and an opinion of what I would consider if it was me, but please make sure to always consult with your doctor/specialist.
1) EPA and DHA (possibly ratio 2:1) from either molecularly distilled fish oil (possibly 5 stars IFOS certificate) or, even better, CO2 supercritical extracted fish oil with antioxidant complex (MINAMI nutrition). Due to the high cost of the second one, I would take one or 2 capsules of it, and the rest from the first one, up to reach 20 grams net of EPA+DHA per day for the first few weeks.
Then decrease 2–5 grams every couple of weeks and stabilize to a 5 to 7 grams per day.
The fish oil has to be taken during the meals, and the meals have to contain fats (good ones, such as avocados, extra virgin olive oil).
2) Vitamin D3: 10,000 (10 thousands) IU / day, during the meals, with fat, together with the above mentioned fish oil
3) Acetyl-L-Carnitine ARGINATE + Acetyl-L-Carnitine alone: 1500 mg in the morning, empty stomach, 30 minutes before breakfast. 1000 mg 30 minutes before lunch
4) 1000 mg Taurine a few minutes before breakfast and dinner. 1000 mg Taurine at bedtime.
5) A berry extract containing also the species called Vaccinium uliginosum. Such as blueberry pomegranate extract from Life Extension: 1 capsule every 12 hours
6) CinnamonRich extract of cinnamon (only this, has to be patented and concentrated 10:1 or 12:1, to get rid of the liposoluble compounds that might stress liver otherwise): 1 caps. right before the main meals
7) Theracurmin: 60 mg 3 times/day during the meals, with fats and with fish oil, together with a piece (size of a small finger) of organic whole tumeric to chew
8) Gamma Tocopherol (the Vitamin E product has to have much MORE Gamma than Alpha tocopherol!): 1 capsule during the heaviest meal, with fats
9) Vitamin C + Bioflavonoids, 1000 mg 3 times / day (every 8 hours)
10) A very broad range of strains of probiotic, 1 per day
11) A complete and well formulated multivitamin, such as Two-Per-Day capsules
It should be continued for a prolonged time.
I hope this helps.
Also, Alon Kaplan ‘s advice about exercising is very good to improve brain recovery and neurogenesis. Make sure to alternate both resistance training and cardio (but not overtraining!).

6d0c29d5,What is the number one way to encourage neuroplasticity and speed up stroke recovery?,"Repetition. While laying in bed in rehab, I “played” with my fingers for hours on time. Initially, I couldn’t move my affected hand, but as movement came back, I did everything I could. At first, it was just trying to make a fist. When I could sort of do that, I started doing it constantly. Then, I started struggling to touch my thumb to my forefinger, then I tried touching thumb to middle finger…
When I first tried typing, I thought I would never be able to do it again. But I do. When I went back to work, my Occupational Therapist asked what would be hardest. I said using the little finger of my affected hand for the ‘a’, ‘q’ and ‘z’ keys without hitting CapsLock. She gave me a little piece of velcro to put on my CapsLock key. It helped me know that my little finger missed the mark.
Repeat exercises and other forms of therapy 10x each or as directed by your therapist. Do the entire set three or four times each day. Repeat daily exercises regularly for months or years. Most neurological exercises are simple and don’t fatigue the muscles. The focus is on reconnecting the brain, not building muscle.
It has been two years since my stroke, but if I don’t do my exercises at least a couple times every day, I don’t walk or move with as much control. I installed a grab bar for safety doing balance exercises. Initially, I tried using the kitchen counter, but safety 1st!"

9c27c2fd,"How can I learn more more about massive stroke recovery and, in particular, what does the patient understand?","IMHO, the patient is capable of understanding a hell of a lot more about the process than the doctors!
The patient understands that it will take time.
The patient knows that there’s no clock — that recovery can occur more than a year after the stroke.
The patient know that Recovery” doesn’t mean just learning how to walk again — it means feeling awake again. It means feeling like you can think again. It means conquering the visible AND the invisible. If I had a dollar for every time a neurologist has said, “Wow — you’re as good as new!” I might be able to afford a visit to a neurologist who actually *listens*.
What can you or a doctor do? Listen! Ask the patient how they’re feeling. Read. Look at the ‘recovery’ process other survivors have been through."
3bf607b0,What is the most valid measurement tool used for Stroke Recovery Outcome?,"I have not used stroke assessment scales in a long time and rarely used them when I worked in a rehab center. To a large part it is subjective because of all the factors that can be affected, There are multiple assessment scales of function like speed of ambulation and ability to dress oneself. There is a whole library of assessment tools and different ones will appeal to different clinicians. The most “valid” one may be so detailed that it is impractical for clinical use. Lastly who is doing better the person who can walk faster with a brace vs one walking slower without a brace."

I stroked while having a craniotomy at 10 months old to remove a astrocytoma giblogangloma ( spelling/ grammar is a learning disability from the stroke so please excuse that). Anyway I have the ability to get seizures so I take Lamictal for it. During my second stay at a psych unit I was placed on Remeron. Once I got home I read the side effects and it didn’t seem too bad so I continued taking it.
I started gaining weight enough where a lot of my clothes were not fitting anymore. I looked at the side effects again and discovered one way more serious. Ever since taking Remeron when I went to bed some nights my left leg would uncontrollably twitch. With me having the ability to have seizures and it being my partially paralyzed side of my body twitching I stopped it that night.
A few months later I saw my neurologist and she said I never should of been put on Remeron because of its ability to cause seizures. Be careful with it."

What can it be, and how can they be treated?","I presume that you are under the care of a doctor. You may be diabetic, which reduces circulation and healing responses. This is a common area for ulcers.
One of my assistants has an older relative with ulcers that would not heal for a year, despite the recommendations of their doctor and nurse. Antibiotic salves, covered with bandages.
They tried a 30% solution of xylitol sugar to wet gazes, then covered it with a bandage. The results were dramatic in a few days. Xylitol can be found in granular form in vitamin and health food stores. Fill a small bottle 1/3rd full with xylitol, then fill the rest with tap water. Shake. It will appear cloudy.
Clean the surface of the ulcers with wet gauze. Pat dry. Place gauze wet with the xylitol solution and cover with a bandage. Replace daily."

I can tell you a hit to the brain like a stroke is very much energy draining. I too slept a lot. I agree with Holly, she probably is aware of more going on around her than you think. I recognized people and was able to respond. But depending on what part of the brain that was injured makes all the difference. Was her speech center of the brain affected? She may need speech therapy to relearn how to speak. Do you have access to medical care specializing in brain injury? I was told I would ‘never’ get better, never walk, blah blah. I DID get better! Raised 2 awesome children who were babies at the time. I walked a breast cancer 60 mile walk in 3 days. Most people that meet me can not even tell I ever had a brain injury.
Never.ever give up. The human spirit is STRONG. I would talk with her doctor and get a medical opinion. Then sit back and watch her get stronger and stronger.
A stroke is a ‘BIG Deal’ I’m sorry your mom and family are having to go through this. It is HARD for all involved. Depending on her health before the stroke and the severity of the stroke with good therapy and good medical care I pray she will get stronger everyday.

How much% have you recovered?,"It’s been 9 years since I had hemorrhage aneurysm. It was pretty severe, about 25% of right side brain was dead. Lucky to survive. First few years were miserable. None stop pain in my left sides. Especially joints. left hand was in tight clench and couldn’t open up or any relaxation, as well as left foot and all the toes curled down. I’ve been pretty diligent about walking, exercising for years. Going through depression and pain managing, I started meditation, tai chi, going up the hill/mountain daily. Few years later switched going up the hill to swimming. I tried alternative medicine, tcm(traditional Chinese medicine: received and studied) massage, etc. I guess I have improved, specially my attitude and outlook in life. Pain is almost gone and whenever it comes I manage it with cannabis, both thc and cdb. I was worried about repercussions but after few years of trying not doing it, first time was magical.. no pain and I was even getting motivated and enjoying for few hours until effect lasted. Realizing and accepting life is short and might as well enjoy best you can, you just have to let go and do whatever at this stage.
Physically I’m still limping and left hand is still not functioning but it’s lot looser.
I try to be as independent as possible. Driving is one of important thing for getting around and comforts. I still haven’t given up yet I’m not expecting 100% either. After many years of frustration, last thing I wanted was to play guitar again but finally trying to completely let it go, being almost 10 years now."
57b1a740,Can hyperbaric oxygen therapy improve recovery from a stroke?,"As others have noted, some studies have shown that HBOT can improve some symptoms associated with acute ischemic stroke. The earlier in the disease process the better.
Unfortunately, many hospitals do not use it for such, as it is not an approved diagnosis by the Undersea & Hyperbaric Medical Society, so it is unlikely to be covered by insurance. (This may vary in some states) so most hospital associated chambers will not be able to treat you, especially if they have contracts with Medicare and Medicaid (neither that will pay for HBOT in stroke cases)
If your insurance does not pay for therapy, there are many private hyperbaric clinics that will take private payment, quite often an amount close to what your copay might have been anyway, so look for those options."
9ede924f,Can we create a 2 stroke electric motor (work stroke and recovery/recharge) that is similar to a 2-stroke combustion engine (compression and working stroke)?,"So you would want a linear motor, something like a solenoid, that would provide power in one direction, but then regenerate power in the reverse. How would it return to home? You would need some sort of outside force to return the mechanism to home position. Now the problem comes to how you do this.
If you have a spring on the setup to push it back home, then on the outward stroke you will have to use additional power to overcome the spring that will return it to home position. The energy needed to extend the spring will always be more than you can generate by the return stroke.
If you have some outside force to return the spring, then you still need to overcome that force on the outward stroke. So either way, it take a lot more energy to extend this linear motor than you can generate from it.
So yes, we could create one. The question is why would we want to? Yes there are some specialized application where this could be useful. However in general use, it doesn’t gain you anything. The laws of physics and thermodynamics say that we will never be able to come close to breaking even on the power generated. You are adding a large amount of complexity with little practical return."
bf22bec6,Is the treatment for and recovery rate from a stroke much better today than back in the 1960s or 70s?,"In the US, treatment of acute stroke is nothing short of revolutionary. Patients who come in unable to talk or walk have a reasonable chance of walking out of the hospital 3 days later.
Many US medical center have an acute stroke team. They require an emergency MRI, read in real time by a stroke neurologist and reviewed by an interventional radiologist. The patient then is in the cath lab and the interventional radiologist removes the clot from the brain using a newly designed catheter that is purchased by the hospital at $9,000 per unit.
Last year my medical center treated their first acute stroke that way, a 60 year old man who could not walk and could not talk with half of his body paralyzed. He walked out unassisted 3 days later and spoke normally with only a slight hesitancy in speech but completely and easily understandable. He was on the front page of a local paper the following week.
If an emergency room and hospital don’t have that capability, ideally the patient should be moved by paramedic ambulance or helicopter ASAP to a center that does. If brain tissue dies due to lack of oxygen, then the neurological problems are by and large permanent.

95db5bcd,Are there any chances of recovery for vision loss due to a stroke for an age 32 patient with migraine history (3 years)?,What you need to know. About one-third of stroke survivors experience vision loss. Most people who have vision loss after a stroke do not fully recover their vision. Some recovery is possible – this will usually happen in the first few months after a stroke. Stroke can happen to anyone at any age. Carla Nash
24ad54ed,How do recovery periods differ for different types of strokes?,"As I understand it, hemmhoragic (sp?) strokes are generally larger than ischemic strokes and therefore more difficult to recover from.
Personally, I suffered from several ischemic strokes and have had doctors meet me and declare that, “Wow, you fully recovered!” I always dread those conversations. I have a lot of invisible deficits; I can’t write by hand, I’m ‘allergic’ to sunlight, I hate noisy places, and I cry in lots of inappropriate scenarios, such as when i hear loud music. (Marching bands, most notably.) Most of all, though, I’m tired. Some (most?) days, I wake up tired; some days, I have to go someplace noisy/crowded, and I get tired; some (many) days, it’s sunny out and I get tired. I’m too tired to drive. I’m often too tired to take care of my five yo. It just plain sucks.
I’m ten years out. I am getting better, but it’s slow, and I suspect I’m on an asymptote that doesn’t really ever hit normal again. I caution you to refine your question of ‘recovery’ and NOT discuss it with patients as if they’re ok or are going to be ok, because you just don’t know if they will."
331ee42e,"What are some experiences of hand mobility recovery after a stroke? My dad had a stroke a few days ago and his left leg is weak but mobile, but the left hand is not moving.","The key is repetition and movement. It’s not enough to massage it, there has to be intent on the part of the patient to try and move the hand. Or any limb that due to a stroke has lost some function.
Remember that a stroke is actual damage to the brain. A clot thrown off, a vessel that tears within the brain, really any trauma that causes an escalating group of symptoms that ends in some form of loss to the body and our ability to move or think, due to damage to the brain, usually in a localized area.
The brain has to rewire itself to take over functions, and if the damage is not to great, recovery is at least partial to complete given time. There is no way to predict how much time or how much of a recovery is possible.
Yet I can tell you that recovery is based on daily, even hourly habits of effort and practice, and continuing the process throughout the rest of your life.
You are rebuilding connections, and trying to move your hand sends a signal out, giving the brain direction and effort, while at the same time, going through therapy sending signals up to the brain. The bombardment from both directions will enhance the chance of the brain adapting to the newer pathways.
Ultimately though, you should talk with your doctor, and the therapist for the proper types of exercises, how much much damage is there, and also if there are any other ongoing issues that might contribute to further problems."

6c58876b,Is complete recovery possible after a decompressive craniectomy for a stroke?,
ae50c9a5,"Of course rehab, but outside of rehab, what is a good way to help speed up recovery from a hemorrhagic stroke, like to wake up nerves and such?","Not sure I know what you mean by “wake up nerves”. During a brain hemorrhage, neurons are destroyed by contact with blood. The Blood-Brain Barrier normally protects delicate neurons. When that is breached, the affected part of the brain dies. It will never wake up.
There is a thin ring around the destroyed area of the brain that is probably damaged by the increased pressure from the hemorrhage that may recover, but that simply takes time.
The brain can “rewire” around the damaged area, which is what rehab is designed to stimulate. The more repetitions of the stupid exercises you do, the more effectively the brain will rewire. This is true of speech therapy as well as physical therapy and occupational therapy.
If you’re asking about sensation, as in “waking up” the ability to feel things, the problem isn’t in the face, trunk, arm or leg. The problem is in the brain’s processing of input from the regions outside the brain. How long it takes for the brain to regain the ability to process sensory input properly will vary and depends on the region of the stroke.
I had a profound loss of sensation on the affected side. About a month after my stroke, my brother and SIL visited me in rehab. I said how much my neck hurt from my shoulder and arm just hanging like dead meat. My brother stood behind my chair and gave me a vigorous shoulder rub. I said that felt really good and asked him to rub the affected side. My SIL’s eyes widened. Apparently, he’d been rubbing both sides equally. He also gave my arm an acupressure massage. I could feel it when he really dug in and it “hurt good.” I don’t know it the vigorous, deep, stimulating massage had an effect, but within a few days, I began feeling the affected side again.
When touched I felt a burning sensation and I felt “pins and needles” all the time. I thought that would go away once things settled. Four and a half years later, I’m still waiting. When stroke affects the thalamus, it sometimes sets off a pain syndrome originally called “Thalamic Pain Syndrome”. Apparently that is what I have. I’ve consulted various neurologists over the years and they’ve given me a “ladder” of treatment options.

0b824f57,What's the likelihood of making complete a recovery from a really bad stroke?,"I would love to answer with a number, a reassuring tale…..
But
I've treated more than 1000 stroke patients as a physical therapist in a ward specialized in stroke rehab. And the best answer I can give is my honest experience.
A severe stroke, is major damage to the brain, a huge volume is dead (forever, not coming back), and a sphere around it that's in chock. Some of the neurons in the sphere might recover to a degree (from not at all to full function). If it's a bleed than it's way more complicated.
Remember the dead area, will never recover - after a while there will only be scar tissue in the area. The area in chock experience swelling, chemical imbalances and more.
If it's a blood clot and it's treated rapidly and correctly, damage can be reduced to an amazing degree. That's why you always call 911 if you suspect a stroke immediately !!
Inter cranial bleeding is much more complicated, and the damage will depend on a lot of factors.
A big blood clot will most of the time block the Middle Cerebral Artery some where. That is bad, the artery supplies blood to a huge area including sensory inputs, motor control plus a number of other important areas on the brain like speech.
If it's a clot, the sphere in chock will recover and initially the patient will get better fast. If they are treated early (the clot is removed or dissolve). The dead zone might be small and symptoms will be small. But we are talking about a major stroke - so the left or right side is paralyzed and often the person will experience some symptoms like chronic tiredness, cognitive deficits, personality changes, paralysis in some degree, pain, numbness, partial blindness, loss of speech, loss of understanding language…..
So no. Unless the person gets to a big hospital with a neurological ward maybe even a neurosurgeon fast (Hours), there's no chance for complete recovery.
I'm sorry but, nobody gets by a severe stroke without some symptoms,
Hope that helps, remember they need you to be there for them. But always ask before helping. Give them the time to do whatever they can by and for themselves."
59dfc816,What is the chance of recovery from a basal stem stroke?,"Hi, just as with any other stroke, the likelihood of recovery from a brain stem stroke depends on a lot of things, most importantly the size of the infarct and its location. It also depends on what interventions if any were performed and when, as well as patient factors such as age, history of prior strokes, and comorbid conditions. It also depends on what level of function you want to count as recovery.
Stroke recovery prognosis can be difficult for all these reasons. I would suggest it's probably best to talk to a neurologist who is familiar with the individual case."
47ac4b1f,"Yesterday my grandma had a stroke, she hadn’t received help for 12 hours and is now paralyzed on the entire left side of her body. Does anybody know the odds of her recovering or ways to improve her recovery?","They used to say if a person comes to the hospital within 3 hours of a stroke ,Brain damage can be prevented.But the new study suggests that the traditional three-hour time window is too short. By combining data from multiple clinical trials, Maarten Lansberg, MD, PhD, assistant professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford, and colleagues from Belgium and Germany showed that treatment can benefit patients up to 4.5 hours after they experience their first symptom. Their findings were published online May 21 in the journal Stroke.
Every year, more than 750,000 Americans experience a stroke, or brain attack, due to a sudden drop in blood flow to the brain. Most strokes are ischemic, meaning they're caused by a blocked artery. For these strokes, a medication called tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA, can open blocked blood vessels and help restore blood flow to the brain.
Ideally one should go to a hospital where they can go through the groin vein and remove the blood clot in the brain.
Signs of stroke
Face: Smile and see if one side of the face droops.
Arms: Raise both arms. Does one arm drop down?
Speech: Say a short phrase and check for slurred or strange speech.
Time: If the answer to any of these is yes, call 911 right away and write down the time when symptoms started.
Warning Signs
Sometimes a stroke happens gradually, but you’re likely to have one or more sudden symptoms like these:
Numbness or weakness in your face, arm, or leg, especially on one side
Confusion or trouble understanding other people
Difficulty speaking
Trouble seeing with one or both eyes
Problems walking or staying balanced or coordinated
Dizziness
A severe headache that comes on for no reason
If you have these symptoms, call 911 even if you’re not sure you’re having a stroke.
3 Types of Strokes
Ischemic Strokes (Clots)
Ischemic strokes
occur as a result of an obstruction within a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain. The underlying condition for this type of obstruction is the development of fatty deposits lining the vessel walls. This condition is called atherosclerosis. These fatty deposits can cause two types of obstruction:
Cerebral thrombosis refers to a thrombus (blood clot) that develops at the clogged part of the vessel.
Cerebral embolism refers generally to a blood clot that forms at another location in the circulatory system, usually the heart and large arteries of the upper chest and neck. A portion of the blood clot breaks loose enters the bloodstream and travels through the brain’s blood vessels until it reaches vessels too small to let it pass. A second important cause of embolism is an irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation. It creates conditions where clots can form in the heart, dislodge and travel to the brain.
Hemorrhagic Strokes (Bleeds)
Hemorrhagic
stroke
accounts for about 13 percent of stroke cases. It results from a weakened vessel that ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain. The blood accumulates and compresses the surrounding brain tissue. The two types of hemorrhagic strokes are intracerebral (within the brain) hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a weakened blood vessel ruptures. Two types of weakened blood vessels usually cause hemorrhagic stroke. An aneurysm is a ballooning of a weakened region of a blood vessel. If left untreated, the aneurysm continues to weaken until it ruptures and bleeds into the brain. An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a cluster of abnormally formed blood vessels. Any one of these vessels can rupture, also causing bleeding into the brain.
Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)
TIAs are often labeled mini-strokes
because they can be relatively benign in terms of immediate consequences. But the term “warning stroke” is more appropriate for these temporary episodes, because they can indicate the likelihood of a coming stroke. A TIA is a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. The blockage is short-term or temporary during a TIA or warning stroke. The clot may dissolve on it its own or get dislodged so that it stops causing the symptoms. Temporary symptoms may occur. A third of U.S. adults have had symptoms consistent with a TIA. The symptoms are similar to an ischemic stroke, but TIA symptoms usually last less than five minutes with an average of about a minute. When a TIA is over, that particular blockage usually causes no permanent injury to the brain.

0dfb4676,What are the chances of recovery for patients after ischemic stroke?,"Ischemic stroke happens when arteries to the brain are blocked and blood cannot reach the brain .It can affect many functions and also cause paralysis. The brain cells begin to die minutes after the stroke. So it is best to rush the patient to a medical doctor immidiately. Chances of recovery are very good if the patient is given medical help as soon as possible best within 3 hours of the attack . The doctor gives clot busting medicine and the patient starts recovering. My husband too suffered from ischemic stroke and has recovered fully . He got a paralytic attack and the right side of his body was in the process of getting paralysed. I got to know something was wrong as his voice changed and he spoke in blurred sentences and his right hand could not lift his spoon at the dining table and was falling flat and rushed him to hospital emergency where he was given clot dissolving medicine in the stretcher itself before he was put in the bed and he recovered fully. He smokes, has type 2 diabetes and has high cholestrol and high blood pressure. Now he takes medicine to control diabetes , walks a lot and takes blood thinning medicines and lives a normal life. People are not aware of the symptoms therefore there is a delay in taking them to the Doctor many a time. But, it is possible for a patient to recover fully as in my husband’s case through allopathic medicine."
f1b3152e,"Have you experienced a right-side, MCA stroke? What was your experience of recovery like?","I had a right side thalamic hemorrhage. Every stroke is different, but my experience is that recovery depends on the time you put into repeating “trivial” exercises and your determination to recover.
While in rehab, I was stuck in bed when not with a therapist, so as soon as I attained the ability to make a fist I did finger exercises hour after hour. My therapists said that the affected side can “learn from the non-affected side, so I did them with both hands. Initially, I couldn’t reliably touch my thumb to each finger in turn, but by watching the affected hand, I eventually managed it. Later, I was able to do it without watching. Now, I can type with 10 fingers, though I sometimes miss with my little finger. I hit CAPS LOCK instead of ‘a’, for instance.
I lost proprioception, but some of that returned. I still have to check where my foot is before I stand up and walk. When getting out of an Uber, I forgot about my foot. It was tucked somewhere, and I fell. I can walk with a single point cane to help with balance. On smooth, even surfaces, I don’t even need the cane.
I was in rehab for almost 6 weeks, then had in-home rehab for another six weeks. I returned to work after 5 months. Neuroplasticity is your friend. Do the stupid exercises over and over and over every day. It does help.
Good luck!"
c9822072,"Are there any good books I can read to help with the recovery from a stroke, for speech/rehabilitation?","My favorite book on stroke recovery did not address specific therapies but talked about the recovery process. It is called Navigating the Complexities of Stroke by Louis R Caplan.
Every stroke is different and everyone has a different recovery path. The key is staying with it and doing the exercises your therapists give you, even after you stop seeing the therapist regularly.
There is hope. Work hard and don’t give up. The exercises help, if you do them over and over and over and over, every day, week after week, month after month. Record yourself now and again after six months. You’ll be amazed by the progress you see. Day to day, it is hard to notice improvement but the small improvements add up if you keep working."

5ab6b444,"(Serious) Those who have had a stroke, or know someone that has, how was your recovery?","S-L-O-W! I had a massive stroke 20 years ago! A week before I delivered my last baby. I started in rehab right away, sent to the OB unit and was sent back to the rehab unit. The ‘typical’ brain rewires itself around the ‘affected’ part of the brain for 2–3 YEARS post stroke. I was told by my Dr. I had 2 years but I noticed some things returning up to 2.5 years post stroke! The best advice I can give you is to immobilize the affected arm and FORCE your affected arm to do everything. This was not done to me in therapy, but it would’ve helped me so much. Cool thing when you lose use of an arm or hand his buddy the unaffected arm tries to help his ‘friend’ Help those neurons reconnect faster by forcing yourself to use it!

6583d4fe,What is the recovery time for a dog bladder post spinal stroke?,"What do you mean by “spinal stroke?” It is a term I have not heard before.
Do you mean some kind of spinal injury? If so, a loss of bladder control is possible.
Typically, the animal will lose the ability to engage the muscles that squeeze the bladder empty. Consequently, the bladder will continue to fill with urine, which ultimately leaks out somewhat continually. It is distressing to the animal and probably very uncomfortable, too. Think of how you feel when your bladder is uncomfortably full.
Incontinence pads or bands (for male dogs) can help with the urine discharge, but they do not help the animal’s distress. Some medications may be beneficial, as is catheterization.
Your Vet is the best source of information on this issue, because it depends on where the injury was and what type of injury it was."

A ""stroke"" is called a CVA (CerebroVascular Accident) and can be caused by thrombosis or rupture of a vessel supplying the brain. Hypertensive CVAs can affect any part of the brain, any number of the vessels directly distal to the point of rupture, plus any spillage of blood on to the brain itself.
The preceding is not to negate the existence of some rough average as to range of partial recovery. I just don’t know what that is."
9a6ad293,A 19-year-old has a stroke and is paralyzed from the neck down. What are her chances of making a recovery/being able to walk again?,A 19 year old with a stroke is unusual but with a diagnoses of paralysis from the neck down it doesn’t sound good if this is complete paralysis necrosis in the cervical nervous system involvement but if the blood flow is restored from the stroke is may be temporary or incomplete paralysis and would have a much better outcome. It basically depends on what the nerve involvement is with this stroke and at what cervical nerves are involved. A neurologist is most undoubtedly involved in the prognosis and that is good and if there is a spinal rehabilitation center close by for rehab this would be essential to therapy. i can only hope and pray that it is incomplete paralysis and hope the 19 year old has the stamina for his or her job of gettin well as it will take all that person has to get as much function back as they can.
6ade29d3,Do you think that aspirin reduces the size of the damaged area of the brain and initiated the repair of mechanisms and improves behavioral recovery after an ischemic stroke?,"Aspirin does not reduce the size of the damaged area of the brain or “initiate repair mechanisms” after an ischemic stroke. When ischemic strokes block blood flow to part of the brain, the part of the brain that does not receive blood dies. It cannot be repaired.
With therapy, neuroplasticity can “rewire” around the damage, but the damage is permanent. It will show on CT scans for the rest of the stroke survivor’s life.
I’ve regained function since my (hemorrhagic) stroke thanks to lots of physical and occupation therapy. I’m still doing my PT exercises at home. I saw my original PT by chance recently and he was impressed! He said I must have done hundreds of thousands of reps to have recovered so well. But I have a fluid-filled hole in my brain — the damaged area has been washed away over the years since my stroke.

cf9ea2cf,"In first aid, what are all the recovery positions for heart attack, stroke, seizure and cardiac arrest?","Fit? Fit?
Do you mean seizure ?
For everything except cardiac arrest and seizure, the recovery position is that of comfort and safety while the EMTs arrive. Slightly raising the head and shoulders is pretty effective.
Cardiac arrest means that the heart has stopped. There is no recovery position. The position is that of providing CPR, again, while waiting for the EMTs.
If it's a Hallmark movie type of seizure, more professionally known as epilepsy with a grand mal seizure, help the person to safely lie down and move hard objects out of the way. When the seizure stops, roll them to one side and make sure that they are able to breathe easily. EMTs.
Lesser seizure activity, if possible, sitting down works. When I have my episodes, I don't want to lie down. I also don't want to be left alone. I'll let you know about the EMTs, but because my speech becomes very slurred and I stutter badly for several hours, it may be difficult for me to speak.

b1442bf3,After a stroke which processes occur in damaged brain tissues? I mean from a point when tissues suffer from hypoxia to a recovery stage when a brain adapts to it's new condition. Which complications could a patient get?,"I’m not sure what you’re looking for. I had a hemorrhage in my brain (hemorrhagic stroke). They watched me closely for about 24 hours looking for signs of pressure inside the cranium that would require emergency surgery. Then they did another CT scan to check whether the bleeding had stopped. If it hadn’t stopped, I would have needed surgery to stop it.
A Speech Therapist tested my ability to swallow on the 2nd day. I’d had nothing by mouth at that point. My swallowing was not perfect, so they put me on thickened liquids (yuck!) and soft foods. They didn’t want me to aspirate food or drink and develop bacterial pneumonia.
My blood pressure was sky high during the acute stroke, and they lowered it very slowly to avoid shocking the brain with the change in pressure. I was in ICU for two weeks until my BP was under 160. Then, I was transferred to a critical care telemetry unit.
The blood that had leaked into my brain had burst into one of the ventricles and displaced the cerebrospinal fluid that normally fills the ventricles. The blood drained slowly into my spine, causing a ferocious headache that lasted over a week. The headache was painful, but harmless.
The nurses watched over the side that was paralyzed. They carefully positioned my “useless” arm on a pillow. They kept my “dead” leg covered and warm. I couldn’t feel anything on that side, so the nurses were making sure I did not harm myself by getting into a position that cut off blood flow to a limb.
My affected arm hung like dead weight from my shoulder. It pulled on the shoulder joint all the way across to my neck. I couldn’t feel anything except the deep pain of the strained muscles or tendons, but it felt nice when the nurses rubbed liniment into the area. They placed my arm on a pile of pillows to support it and protect the shoulder joint.
That is about all I remember about complications in my case, but when I got to rehab and worked in groups of stroke survivors, I saw that many of them had ugly craniotomy incisions. A craniotomy has many risks of complications as well, though since I didn’t need one (thank goodness!)I don’t know what they are.
In my first week of rehab, I was assessed for deficits. They tested my limbs, my eyesight, my sensation, my strength, etc. They also tested me for cognitive deficits in memory, attention, executive function, and other things."

Mine was “Silence is golden”, “different strokes for different folks” and “live and let live”.","Hi Andrea, — Your parents gave you three pieces of very good advice. Lucky you! I particularly had the “Live and Let Live” custom printed on a t-shirt that I wore, back in the 70's.
My step-dad once told me, “It's just as easy to marry a rich man as it is a poor one.” Well, it may be, if you throw love out of the equasion. He was young when he said that to me.
My dad told me, “Where there's a will, there's a way.” That advice has served me well, except for one nearly fatal experience, which I reported on in detail in another post, yesterday. I don't know if you are able to access other posts I have made.
Lastly, at a very young age, someone said to me, “Don't believe anything you hear, and only half of what you see.” That comment was likely intended more as a joke rather than sound advice. However, I've put it to discretionary good use and find there is a lot of truth in it."
c7e5884e,Is there any lifestyle (including food) you could have changed to help prevent your stroke? What stroke prevention advice can you offer us seniors?,"Whole-food plant-based diet without refined or processed food, and very little or no oil not only prevents cardiovascular diseases but it can also reverse it. The plant-based diet should not include any animal protein including dairy and eggs. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Director of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Reversal Program at the Cleveland Clinic has actually reversed arterial plaque buildup in his patients by changing the diet, as shown in the angiographic evidence below. Image A is shows the original plaque buildup and image B is after being on a whole-food plant-based diet for 32 months
Such a reversal is unbelievable to most doctors who believe that once you get the disease, only option is to keep taking pills (to manage it), or if the blockage gets severe, the only option is surgery, for example bypass surgery in case of coronary arteries.
You may want to look at my answer to a similar question on Quora for more information here. Ramesh Kakkad's answer to Will atherosclerosis go away if you change your diet?"
28be0976,Does the latest medical advice suggest taking aspirin and calling 911 at the first signs of a stroke?,"For any kind of stroke, hemorrhagic, ischemic, or a TIA ""Mini stroke"" calling 911 as soon as possible is probably the single best thing you can do.
For much the same reasons aspirin's anticoagulant effects help during a heart attack, if you're experiencing an ischemic stroke, that is a stroke being caused by a clot in your blood stream that gets caught in a vessel in your brain, then aspirin would probably be great. After all its pretty much the exact same concept as what's happening in a heart attack (just in the brain instead). And a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or ""mini-stroke"" is an ischemic stroke where the clot causing the problems simply dislodged on its own allowing blood flow to return before permanent damage sets in. The clot(s) (and the underlying conditions causing them) are still floating around waiting to get stuck again, and next time you might not be so lucky as to have it dislodge on its own again. That's why TIA's are treated so serious, and why even if the stroke symptoms reverse you should still seek emergency help sooner rather than later.
However, for a hemorrhagic stroke, the opposite is true. Unlike an ischemic stroke caused by a clot, a hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a hemorrhage, or bleed in the brain. In that case you WANT your blood to clot up to stop the bleeding. Taking an anti-coagulant like aspirin or any other blood thinner will only destroy whatever clots stopping the bleed have formed, making the bleeding, and the strike itself, that much worse.
The problem is that short of a CT scan, there's no reliable way to tell which kind of stoke you're having. Even doctors in the Emergency Room with access to powerful clot busting medicine won't give it until they get the scans back. Why? The clot buster that will save an ischemic stroke patient will kill a hemorrhagic stroke patient. If the doctor in the ER can't tell the difference without the scanner, us EMTs and Paramedics in the field certainly cant, and neither can non medically trained patients and their families. While over the counter aspirin is no where near as powerful as TPA clot busters, unless you're experiencing the Transient mini strokes typically caused by clots, I'd personally say hold off and simply call 911."
2211c346,I saw people sharing something about how making someone bleed with a needle can save them if they have a brain stroke. How wrong/dangerous is this advice?,"This hoax has been around since at least 2012
. It’s rubbish. Yuk!!
Interestingly enough, in grown-up medical centres around the world, if:
You come to hospital early on with your stroke;
The stroke is due to an embolism (a clot lodging in a blood vessel in the brain);
Other circumstances are favourable …
… there’s now a good chance you can have an endovascular clot retrieval.
This procedure (when used well) has been shown to have a huge effect in improving outcomes after stroke. At my hospital we’ve seen magnificent results.

859aeb44,"Lately, it feels like I'm poking the cue ball instead of stroking it, any advice on this?","As others have said, they key is follow-through. You are not just striking a single point on the cue ball and completing your stroke after impact, you are always “pushing” your cue through the space where the cue once occupied. This will allow you to stay accurate (follow through straight) and impart english/follow/draw on the cue as the tip relies on continued impact and friction. Even when you want to get a “soft” shot, you still need to follow-through. Just stroke slower and with less force - but utilize the same follow-through stroke.
When you feel the urge to “poke” the cue, ask yourself why you are doing it. Oftentimes we tentatively poke at something when we are not committed to it. So, before you even get down in position, decide if it’s the right shot you want to make, visualize how it will happen and then align yourself to take the shot. Just think about how you need to stroke the cue and how. Don’t think about where the cue ball will be going afterward or let your mind wander. Just focus on doing this one shot as well as you can and do it. Your “poking” tendencies should stop once you commit fully."
469b55d2,What's the latest medical advice related to post-warning stroke treatment for elderly men?,"Various people are suffering from a stroke issue, and due to the advancement of medical science, there are a couple of post warning stroke treatment options for elderly men.
If the TIA (which stands for transient ischaemic attack) for stroke patient does not have severe carotid atherosclerosis that may be much beneficial as compared to surgery or atrial fibrillation which needs anticoagulation, then antiplatelet therapy along with aspirin, aspirin combined with dipyridamole, or clopidogrel is mainly recommended unless there is a significant risk for bleeding complications.
Combination of both, i.e. aspirin and clopidogrel is not supported, and the reason is that it enhances the risk of bleeding. There are underlying risk factors such as an increase in the blood pressure or diabetes that should be controlled. The therapy of lipid-lowering should be maximized, and an individual need to quit smoking needs to be initiated too, in case the person is into smoking."

We examined him, did the basic work-up like ECG, echocardiogram and a treadmill exercise test. Everything came out as normal. We told him that he was fine and sent him with a good dose of encouragement.
Clearly, it didn’t work.
He came back with symptoms that suggested anxiety.
And then we found out the reason.
His father and uncle had suffered from heart attack at age 50. One uncle had bypass surgery at age 52. Another uncle died suddenly at night, presumably of an heart attack. His grandfather had stroke.
A larger dose of encouragement and placebo did not do any good.
He came back again and again, forcing us to do a ‘64-slice-CT-Angio’ which also turned out to be normal.

Gene and Environment
A strong family history of heart attacks, even in the absence of other risk factors makes the person more susceptible to a heart attack.
It is not just genes that matter, family members tend to share the same environment; the same diet, the same laziness to exercise; the appreciation of the chubby look, the same callous attitude to medical checkup; also has a large supply of prescription medications.
In contrast, a family that exercises regularly, eat healthy; laugh together and remain healthy.

Proof
‘Pima Indians’ living in Arizona, has one of the highest prevalence of Diabetes – roughly 40% of the population have Diabetes.
A small group of Pima Indians are also found in the mountainous region of Sierra Nevada of Mexico. Many believe that the Arizona Pima are those who migrated north for better pastures.
Studies confirmed that both Mexican and American Pima’s are genetically similar. It was not surprising. But what was surprising was this
While US Pimas had a diabetic prevalence of 40%, the Mexican Pimas had diabetes in only 7% people.
Red Circle - Mexican Pima
Red Arrow - American Pima
The reason ?
Hard working Mexican Pima
The Mexican Pima do hard manual work in the field, toiling whole day while the American ones got a headstart with mechanical transport, formal education, fast food and modern lifestyle; unboxing a latent ‘genetic’ diabetes.
The gene was quarantined for good in the Mexicans by hard work and a rustic lifestyle.
A gene is a manual, a instructional code written deep inside your cell. How it expresses is determined, in a large way, by the environment you live in, the way you carry yourself.
You can shove the code book in the attic; or let it auto-pilot your life.

44cd8415,"9 months after suffering a hemorrhagic stroke, I'm starting back to work tomorrow (short hours & light work) any good advice for me?","Congratulations on your survival and recovery! I too returned to work after a hemorrhagic stroke. I took a ride share there and back. Coming home, it was especially important because I was often exhausted by the day.
Please make sure your doctor wrote instructions and requested “accomodation” for you, including the option to reduce hours if they become too much for you. I started at two four hour days and increased my hours gradually, but some weeks, I was just exhausted and couldn’t manage to work as much as I had the week before. I got up to about 25–30 hours of work per week before I hit the wall and just couldn’t do any more.
Everything is a bit harder. Even sitting upright in a chair is an active effort, as odd as it seems. It feels good not letting the stroke deficits define me. That said, don’t live in denial of the deficits. Accepting that things are different than they were before the stroke is an important part of recovery. I could no longer put in the 50-60 hour work weeks as I had before the stroke.
Hopefully, your employer and colleagues will be as welcoming and supportive as mine were."
7e7a46ab,What useful advice can you offer someone who has a loved one recovering from a severe left brain stroke?,"First of all, I’m so sorry that they’re stuck dealing with such an unfortunate event!
For me, my third and final stroke, my only left-brained stroke, was the nail in my coffin. I managed to bork the OTHER side of my basal ganglia, which seems to have made me permanently exhausted. =( None of the ADD medication I took subsequent to my second stroke wakes me up anymore. It is a seemingly small, intractable, enormous problem. It sucks. I’m over it. I’m probably stuck with it for life.
But, in addition to my fatigue (and my increased sensitivity to sunlight and noise, my increasingly tiny handwriting, and my increasingly worse aphasia), I became depressed after my third stroke. I don’t know whether it was because people with left-brain strokes routinely become depressed or whether, after six months of dealing with this sh!t after the second stroke I was just over it, and I will never know, but man … depression sucks. I would pay good money to never, ever feel that way again. Do you remember the effect of the dementors in Harry Potter? It’s like they flew into my house and sucked out all the heat, all the love, and all the things that make life worth living. (Of course, you could also argue that’s exactly what the strokes did. You can see my confusion as to what caused the depression!)
Two things helped me deal with my depression: first of all, my depression led me to try Wellbutrin, which, thanks be to God!, woke me up. Not quite as spectacularly as Adderall, but it also doesn’t make me feel high all the time ;) (Which is a good thing. I feel normal on Wellbutrin.) Second of all, my husband was very up-front about it all; there was no hushed whispering about his “nutty wife”, no hesitancy to get me on medication, no reluctance to find me a counselor. I love that about him! You can certainly do that for your loved one: you can be the strong advocate for help, if they’re willing to take it.
Unfortunately, if you’ve seen one stroke, you’ve seen one stroke — they’re so different that without more information I really can’t say, “You need a top-notch physical therapist”, “You need to go to Timbuktu to see a shaman”, or “You need to feed her lots of chocolate” — though the last one never hurts ;)
Best of luck to you and your loved one!"

842acbdd,The best advice for reducing muscle spasticity/rigidity in stroke patients?,"Overall? That would be reducing or eliminating the inflammation process after the stroke, which CAUSES more complications than the initial lesion would cause.
When I had my 2nd stroke, I had it 10 minutes before reaching the ER. The ER had a very fresh MRI of a lesion. It looked like a walnut in shape and size.
5 days later and another MRI series? A huge white field of inflammation was seen affecting 5 areas of the brain. The inflammation continued, and within 7 days I couldn’t lift my arm over my shoulder and was ataxic, and half my vision was a white light spectrum.
The best way to reduce complications after stroke is to curb/stop the damage from the inflammation process after the stroke. That limits the scope of the damage after the stroke.
The lesions of a stroke are small and local. The inflammation process though, if not contained, even grows over the days affect more areas of the brain."

See me liked steak and pork chops and fried fish but can’t have it now. So everything is dry and it backs up. Willing to bet he was put on something for heart burn and gas. The food he use to eat kept him going so now it is backing up so he don’t feel like eating . So try that hope it helps him."

7264ba7c,"As a body builder for the age of 60+, how much protein must my mom have to recover leg muscles after her stroke? What is some other advice for this?","Strokes damage brain tissue, often destroying some of it. The brain sends electricity to muscles to cause them to contract, via nerve pathways. If the leg muscles DO NOT get signals from the brain’s normal activation site anymore, they must get nerve signals from somewhere in the brain or they will cease contracting sufficiently to prevent atrophy of muscle tissue.
With normal digestion, any protein that previously agreed with the person before the stroke will supply sufficient protein to restore muscle mass after the stroke, IF sufficient nerve signals get to the muscles from the brain.
The amount of protein from normal food that built her leg muscle mass and maintained it is sufficient. Any form of sandwich & glass of milk with her normal food intake is sufficient ( vegan, vegetarian, dairy, egg, meat ) if her swallowing ability and health and appetite allow it.
Normal food is sufficient to rebuild muscle mass, if the person can move their legs and can coordinate to walk again. It will take time to restore walking ability and coordination while the brain heals as much as it is going to heal. The signals controlling walking may have to be taken over by a different part of the brain if the brain is able to do so.
If the person can not walk and does not relearn walking, protein will not maintain muscle mass in the legs because the muscles are not getting enough nerve signals to maintain muscle mass and are atrophying through non use.
Relearning old skills , including walking, after a stroke take time and daily work.
The daily stress is often frustrating and depressing. To combat that tendency, listening to pleasing inspiring thing for a short time each day or through out the day helps endure those feelings.

If the bleeding doesn’t stop, they may have to operate, but my bleeding resolved on its own.

I’m still doing my physical and occupational therapy exercises after more than two years. When I sit or lie around and don’t do my exercises, my deficits become more pronounced. I installed a ballet barre in my study, for me to use when needed for balance. Before, I was exercising in the kitchen, using the counter for balance.

6a831daa,How do I manage the extreme fatigue 14 months post-stroke?,"It’s best to talk with your doctor about fatigue. It could be that the medications are too strong and doses need to be readjusted (heart medications are tiring in itself). So s/he can see if adjusting the dose or using another medication maybe right for you.
Another problem can be getting RESTFUL sleep. I still have that problem after my stroke where I can’t sleep for like 8hrs at once. I sleep for like 4hrs and wake up like clockwork, like the internal sleep clock got fried after the stroke. So sleeping for 4hrs and taking a nap doesn’t feel restful. Make a sleep diary and write down when you went to bed and got up and any naps you took in between. Bring that to your doctor, too.
After a stroke pathways get damaged. It just takes one to ruin getting restful sleep. Mid-brain strokes are plagued with sleep disorders.
If it’s a sleeping disorder, they also may want to recheck your breathing for sleep apnea, too. For months after my stroke I would wake up suddenly as I couldn’t breathe well. Took a good year for that to pass.
Depression/anxiety is also so common after stroke, the docs write a prescription by default even. There’s good reason for it, as the depression/anxiety can last for a long time. Again all it takes is a damaged pathway. It’s nothing to be ashamed of, your body went through grueling stress, and it can only take so much.
So the next time when you visit your doctor, have a talk about those issues. Give him/her your sleep log, too. That way the doc can SEE what’s going on, and if necessary to refer you to a specialist."
dd2f18fc,"What happens when we stroke a key on a keyboard? Does the character that the keyboard gives get directly written to stdin, or is there any buffer between the device and stdin? How does the kernel manage this?","The keyboard doesn’t send characters, it sends scancodes. It’s the job of the OS to translate those to characters if needed, using the currently-selected keyboard layout options (which in Windows are per-app).
Otherwise there are probably buffers at the interrupt request level, then buffers at the input stream level and what not. For example you might notice when your computer is starting to hang (the OS, not just an app), the reaction is different than when an app hangs - press enough keys, and your PC speaker will start beeping (probably indicating the kernel-level buffer is exhausted).
And it’s easy to see that it’s not directly to stdin by the fact that this leaves the question of which stdin unanswered - every process has its own, and depending on where you alt-tab, the keys will get routed to a different process."
ff399f53,What are the best pain management methods for post-stroke headaches/migraines?,"First, it depends on whether they are headaches or migraines. They are physiologically two different conditions with different causes and symptoms. The only thing in common between a headache and a migraine is that they both involve head pain. Migraine is not a synonym for “very bad headache.” How you treat a headache and how you treat or prevent a migraine are also very different. So, unless you clarify whether you intended to ask about post-stroke headaches or post-stroke migraine, the only answers you’ll get are people who don’t know they’re different… and that’s probably not the best source of information.
Headaches are usually treated with various different types of analgesics, ranging from over the counter NSAIDs or headache specific meds like Extra-Strength Excedrin to prescription NSAIDs. Even with OTC meds, talk to your care provider because even OTC meds can have life-threatening side effects, interfere with other meds your on, and create bleeding issues which could be catastrophic post stroke.
Migraines are treated by one of two types of therapies - preventative (prophylactic) or at the time of an attack (abortive). Prophylactic therapies include meds like beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, anti-depressants, anti seizure meds, CGRPs, Botox injections, or non-traditional therapies like massage, physical therapy, acupuncture, etc. Abortives include symptom treating meds like anti emetics, DHE, triptans, opioids, etc (Ignore the individual who said opioids cannot be used to treat migraine. It shouldn’t be the first choice, nor should they be for anything, but for stroke patients who cannot take DHE, triptans, and/or other allergies and therapeutic failures, they are viable options when properly monitored and do help many migraineurs). There are also surgical options like a nerve stimulator implant and some other choices, but those are after meds have failed
You cannot get a specific treatment off Quora or any other place on the internet. Not only have you not specified whether they’re headaches or migraines, as I mentioned. But, also there are many significant medical history factors, potential meds, other underlying medical issues, etc which will factor into safe therapy choices. Talk to your neurologist for the best option given your specific situation"
97ff75ab,What are the possible management of stroke/paralysis in Ayurveda?,"Stroke or the so called Cerebro Vascular Accidents can manifest due to many causes. Can be cerebral thrombosis, hemorrhage, embolism, tumors etc. When a sroke is suspected (stroke in evolution), rush the patient to a tertiary care level hospital with a stroke unit with specialist care providers. Investigate, monitir and decide the interventions according to the findings. Al these are not possible at all in any ayurveda hospitals. Hence the first line management is better done in that sort of a setting
When the patient is stabilized and is discharged with a prescription and physitherapy advices as the case maybe, proceed with that. You will generally get an advice for review after 3 or 4 weeks. Well, do that. By the time, the patient must have improved on various pointers.
There come sthe definite scope of neuro-rehabilitation in deserving cases. Ayurveda does that with an edge over any other interventions available."
9ba290ee,How do I answer why I have not had an employer for three years because I've been healing from a major trauma and stroke? I have over 20 years experience as a litigation paralegal/office manager.,"You respond with a business reason for your gap;
“Due to a personal issue, it was best for me to focus on resolving the issue. I am happy to share that the issue is behind me and I am prepared to use my experience to be a productive employee. Segue into your spectacular elevator speech and Wow them with your accomplishments.”
If you have gotten an interview then your resume is clear about your capabilities. Use the time to talk about your potential fit with this employer. Focus on what you are bringing to the workplace.
The employer wants to know you won’t flake out and leave as you did previously. They don’t really want to know what prevented you from working if it’s in the past. Never mention the word “major trauma” in a workplace setting, even after getting the job. If you haven’t gotten your mental health in order, save those words and subsequent discussions for a licensed therapist."

If they told you to wait then no issues your work will be done and if they tell you to leave then in polite manner ask them its really important and you will wait if its possible for them to squeeze your work in between their appointments and if that works then well and good if not raise a complaint regarding online services and eSeva services.

efcb2d49,"How does Proust manage to spend 1,100 pages to describe 2 or 3 social dinner parties? Is that a stroke of genius or overkill?","I think the hundred page Overture to Swann's Way is the greatest prose passage in all literature. And beginning with À L'Ombre des Jeunes Filles en Fleurs, the second novel, you get Proust's best stuff all the time. Sudden narrative shifts toward his most beguiling characters, head snapping hilarity, eavesdropping on startling social exchanges, thrilling poetic imagery, evocative apercu, the lure of self-discovery. Plus snide comments on everyone else's use of the French language.
If you confined your comments to the 350 pages of flower descriptions following the Overture in Swann’s Way, okay, point taken. But out of a 3400 page work, he got most of them just right.
Moment by moment, Proust provides miracles —
“A little tap at the window, as though some missile had struck it, followed by a plentiful, falling sound, as light, though, as if a shower of sand were being sprinkled from a window overhead; then the fall spread, took on an order, a rhythm, became liquid, loud, drumming, musical, innumerable, universal. It was the rain.”"
4c13310e,"If my tortoise manages to escape from my garden, do you think he will try and come back because he lets me stroke his head?","I don’t know how to answer this question and not come off rude.
A tortoise doesn’t “need” us in the wild. They don’t really give a crap that we are even around while they are our pets as long as they get food and water every morning and evening. Can people have a bond with them? Yeah but not like a dog or cat - and they always run away from home for good.
Do I think it’ll come back? Who the hell knows. Maybe? However what upsets me with this is that you KNOW the tortoise can get out and most likely will again… and instead of doing something to contain the pet you pledged to take care off… you are asking the internet if they will come back.
Maybe fix the issue so they can’t get out and you won’t have to worry about them coming back or not?"
419897cc,"If I'm having a stroke and I managed to call 911, but I can't talk, will they find out where I am, and how can they know in what apartment I am in? If I'm not talking, why wouldn't they just hang up on me?","I am often advising 911 callers: location first!!!! And there is good reason for that advice. If they cannot locate you, they cannot treat you, If you call from a landline the chances are very good that they are going to be able to know what address and apartment number the call came from. BUT if you can't speak, stay on the line anyway;Press #3 for an ambulance. If the operator asks YOU questions #4 is yes, #5 is “no” It might just take some extra time. Although I've harped upon the importance of location in the past here on quora I do understand that many if not most times you will be located, but in cases like this seconds matter.In the case of a stroke call nine-one-one and as usual follow directions the best you can and I am sure you that they will make every attempt to locate you and most likely will be successful. But remember the 3–4–5 codes mentioned, and have confidence in their training. They don't just hang up. They're training covers situations where the caller can't respond."

73a8e336,What are the solutions on water pollution?,"A very important question, with so many aspects.
First there are ditches, canals, rivers, lakes and the sea. Then are many kinds of pollution, and they can behave different. And allso there are several ways pollution ends up in the water.
Let’s break this down. The pollution (I assume you’re talking about) comes from humans. The main sources are houses, industrial activities, transport and mining. The polution can be mineral, chemical or biologal. Humans have a habit of cleaning everything with water. In times there were no detergents and complex chemicals and there were not so many people, that was not a big deal.
Nowadays most pollution can be prevented by using less toxic substances and waste water treatment. The treatment has to be able to take out or neutralize de pollution. Biological waste (like faeces) in small amounts is no big problem, but in large amounts the rotting proces can take all the oxygen out of the water and kill all life. In the oceans this will allmost never happen, because it becomes diluted. But treatment costs money, and in many countrys this will take a huge amount of effort.
In countries that allready have waste water treatment there are often still many things to improve. E.g. in many countries waste-water of big areas is treated in large plants, but water from roofs is on the same sewerage-system. That can cause the treatment-plant to be flushed when there is heavy rainfall.
To top this all off strict legislation is needed. Important is the ban on non-biodegradable plastics, and preventing ships dumping bilge-oil and other waste in the sea.
A difficult problem is toxicm (mineral) waste-water from mining. This is hard to take out of the water and (often) governments that share in the profit don’t give a damn."
75425291,"Why is sex so painful? When my boyfriend tries to insert his penis, it hurts at first and then he manages to put it in. After that, the strokes are uncomfortable and slightly painful. I suspect it’s a lube problem, but what else could it be?","It is possible that his penis may not actually be penetrating your vagina - but basically stroking between the outer lips of vagina and the inner lips of vagina.
It has happened a lot initially and a few times even much later with my current partner that my penis would enter her vagina but would stroke between the outer and inner lips of her vagina— at one point when she had not been cleaning herself properly, my penis was covered with a white, curd-like discharge, which was basically the muck that had been gathering between the inner and outer lips of her vagina.
To ensure that you penetrate her properly ask her to finger-fuck her vagina before penetration and/or ask her to hold and guide your penis into her vagina.
Also, consider fucking her in short shallow strokes while letting her occassionally touch her pussy while fucking and/or touch to guide your penis if needed.
This happens a lot in older women who started having sex later in life and who have not yet got habituated to regular sex to the point of being able to reflexively manage the mechanics of sex to the point of being able to debug pains like this.

If the 2T oil flash point is lower, then it suggests using conventional motor oil will leave gummy deposits from an inefficient burn in the combustion chamber.

A couple of other assumptions may also have accidentally been made for the sake of the narrative.
That said, you had a stroke. You underestimated the effects it would have on you after the fact, so you went back to school before you were actually ready. That didn’t go so well, because you weren’t actually as well off as you thought you were. Once you gave yourself time to fully recover, the healthy, rational decision making version of you, recognized it, and then went back to school to work back up to where you had been.

fe882f4a,Is the well-being of older adults the result of their individual lifestyle choices and financial planning? How much are events such as heart attack and stroke a result of lifestyle choices?,"I see it the other way. One’s lifestyle choices can be derailed by a disease or accident that leaves one unable to earn a living.
There are certainly people who have brought on their own diabetes or heart disease, and have never made an effort to prevent it. There are others who have done everything right, but lost the genetic lottery.
Most people do make some effort to plan for the future of their health and finances. Some folks end up old, healthy and solvent without trying all that hard. Others who actually tried harder may have bad luck that wipes them out.
It’s always possible to twist history to prove that someone didn’t do everything- every single possible thing- to prevent problems. Basically, we are human, and we want to do what we want to do. Or maybe our family, schools and community didn’t help us to develop excellent habits.
I think we should balance judgment with compassion when dealing with our human friends and neighbors."

d772f73e,My mother's obese. She is a recovering stroke patient and has coronary heart disease. How can I know if she's taken in just enough food in her diet?,"Is your mother a willing participant in her new dietary regime? Problems may arise if she is not. Always important to get the patient's co-operation. Get her to stop smoking and moderate her alcohol intake too, if necessary.
An assessment by a professional dietician of her normal intake is the place to start. Is your mother able and willing to keep an ACCURATE dietary record for a week or two? That would be quite important.
When the dietician has made recommendations you could supervise the purchase of the necessary items and remove all illegal/immoral/fattening items from your mother's house, thus removing temptation.
Keeping an eye on her weight at, perhaps, weekly intervals - same time/same day each week - and charting the result may help.
Some elderly people muddle along on jam sandwiches and tea. This is clearly a grossly deficient diet and will lead to important deficiencies of vitamins and minerals. Your dietician may recommend an all-in-one vitamin supplement.
Graded exercise is an important part of your mother's new lifestyle. See if there are any suitable classes/groups locally that she could attend for guidance and encouragement. The social aspect of such groups is often beneficial too. On line and DVD programs can help too. Simply walking round the house or down to the end of the street and back several times each day is a start.
Wholesome pre-prepared meals are available to keep in the freezer. They are for microwaving usually but can be ovened too. Diet size portions are usually available. A supply of suitable snacks will help prevent your mother from nibbling unhelpfully between meals - fresh fruit is the obvious starting place.

2414d672,What are the best exercises for a recovering stroke patient with left side weakness?,"There is no such thing as best exercise.

e34df8de,"As an occupational therapist, in your experience do recovering stroke patients relearning handwriting need bigger ruled paper like young children, or do they tend to prefer or need standard smaller-ruled writing paper?","Thank-you for writing a good question I don’t mind answering.
As my own rule, I don’t use lined paper for my stroke patients when re-learning a fine motor task such as handwriting.
Ruled or lined paper forces the sense of “perfection” early on. Firsly, the patient needs to feel some success with the task. Just holding the writing implement and making a mark—any mark—on the page is success.
I usually have my patients who are working on handwriting first re-learn a good grip on the pen/ pencil/marker. This may take some time and adaptation. Next, I have them work on vertical lines followed by diagonal lines, then horizontal lines, then circles. With these tools, they can then begin forming letters, usually copying or tracing first, especially the patients who have some aphasia or apraxia.
This is a short answer, but generally this is how I like to work on fine motor tasks. Break then down to the components and work on each of those first."
1b653789,Do people fully recover from a stroke?,"Speaking as someone who has had one, I can say that is possible, although the extent of the stroke is probably unique to the individual and largely depends on what areas of the brain are affected and how the brain is able to ‘reroute’ past the damaged areas.
With loss of motor control, some alleviation may be possible by moving limbs in a recognised way, mimicking walking for example or raising one’s arm, which might help to stimulate the growth of new connections but this is not always very successful.
In my case, aphasia was the main symptom, the inability to speak, write or to regain even a partial command of my native language. However, a daily regimen of vocal exercises in front of a mirror (I always wondered what my neighbours thought of me reading aloud from ‘Winnie the Pooh’ or ‘House at Pooh Corner’ during such exercises) and the constant reference to a good thesaurus meant that I was back up to speed within, I guess, two years.
I am still dyslexic when I write (but my typing appears to be OK) and have not tried to access my foreign language abilities very much, although I can follow a performed ‘Les Fourberies de Scapin’ in the original providing that I have the text of the play in front of me.
However, the most important thing, in my view, is the support of one’s family and friends, the people who knew you from before the stroke and can offer feedback on how well you seem to them at all points in the recovery process; are you genuinely improving or is it just wishful thinking?"

c98d0d03,What's the best course of action when recovering from strokes?,"Immediate treatment is the Number One course for successful stroke recovery. The source of the injury must be identified (is it a clot or a bleed?) and the appropriate treatment to abate that event applied. Since most strokes seem to be ischemic (clot) at first glance, anti-clotting medications can ""bust"" the clot and restore blood flow to the affected areas of the brain. If this treatment is accomplished within a few hours (used to be a three hour window, but that window's been opened a bit wider: Time window for
stroke
treatment should be extended
) damage cane be limited and usually treatable.
The second most-important factor in stroke treatment is swift, aggressive and global therapies, physical, occupational and speech. Physical therapy addresses the need to ""re-teach"" muscles how to work, and to provide the opportunity for damaged neurons to re-route signals around damaged areas. Occupational therapy does this, also, but in the teaching of strategies to accomplish every day tasks, occupational therapy has a terrific track record in that ""re-teaching"". Speech therapy is not limited to speech, itself, but to cognition, also, in addition to swallowing issues. All of the therapies and techniques used help the brain recover from the insult of stroke.
In the event of a suspected stroke:
Get the victim to a hospital ASAP
The hospital administers the correct treatments to bust the clot or stop the bleed ASAP.
Therapies start early and continue until there is no further progress, at which time strategies are worked out to accomplish tasks in weakened areas.
Sometimes, some areas of the brain are so damaged they cannot ""come back"", and the victim needs assistance for the rest of their lives. But advances in treating stroke have become routine in Western medicine, and the outcomes have improved by a very large measure. What would have killed a victim even 25 years ago, is nearly completely recoverable now, as long as swift medical and therapeutic intervention is provided."
dd2958e8,Is there a way for a person to fully recover from a stroke?,"It's going to be according to what was damaged in the brain- what areas and how badly- how soon and how much therapy a person receives, and how able they are to utilize the therapy they receive.
A stroke can cause massive damage to the brains, killing whole swathes of brain tissue and, generally, neurons don't grow back. ( Page on jneurosci.org
) So, if the clot or bleed which caused the CVA (cerebral vascular accident) was big, full recovery may be impossible.
If both drug and physical/occupational/speech therapies are started immediately, stroke victims can recover a surprising amount of functioning; surprising for the state in which they were brought in to the Emergency Room, anyway. Clot-busting drugs along with blood thinners help to clear away lingering debris in the brain's circulatory system and also keep a good, steady flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients in to the damaged area. That helps tremendously.
The therapies mentioned above, though, are less efficacious if the damage is severe. PT, which usually focuses on physical strengthening of an affected body part and overall conditioning, and OT, which focuses on every day tasks and abilities, don't do a person who is completely right-side paralyzed much good until the brain heals a bit from the insult of the stroke. There are improvements, certainly, but until the brain starts re-routing itself around damaged areas, these therapies are mostly a holding pattern. Same with speech therapy, although it is speech, with its emphasis on cognition, which can get the ball really rolling. Real improvement starts to be seen about week 3 post CVA, with continued improvement for about 18 months. After that, a plateau is usually reached, and few people can afford to continue the intensive therapy needed to see further improvement.
Two and three years later, there can be little improvement in functional abilities, although strength in musculature can help minimize deficits.
I'm sorry your friend has had to go through this, and will continue with this disability for the rest of her life. The best thing you can do now is to treat her as a friend, help her when she requests it, and not allow her deficits to cause you to see her as someone to be pitied. No one gains from pity."
d3a0e18f,Why can one never recover from a stroke?,"There are two types of strokes that can occur within the hunan body.
The first type is ischaemic stroke which is related to the issue to deficiency of oxygen within the blood going to the brain, or blood in general. This could be the result of a blood clotting somewhere or the narrowing of blood vessels. Various factors can affect both of these to accelerate (in the case of narrowing of blood vessels) and more likely of blood clotting as well. These include:
1) Smoking (Narrowing of the veins)
2) Drinking (Related to Obesity)
3) Drugs (NSAIDs aka Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) Not all but some of them double the risk of blood clotting.
4) foreign objects in the blood which can cause embolism
5) Obesity
6) Cancer
7) Heart Disease
8) High HDL cholesterol levels
9) Ageing
As well as other factors. These factors are not in isolation but make a greatly significant risk when compounded together.
Another cause can be atrial fibrillation which is a blood clot that happens near the heart and can break off and cause a bigger issue near blood vessels going to the brain.
The other type of stroke is called haemorrhagic stroke (also known as cerebral and intracranial haemorrhages) which is when a blood vessel within the brain bursts open and releases blood into and around the brain
The main cause of this would be high blood pressure which can weaken the arteries within the brain. The arteries eventually come to a point where it can not contain that pressure and so burst open.
""Things that increase the risk of high blood pressure include:
being overweight or obese
drinking excessive amounts of alcohol
smoking
a lack of exercise
stress, which may cause a temporary rise in blood pressure"" - http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Stroke/Pages/Whosatriskpage.aspx
Although this type of stroke is less common, it causes a lot more damage to the brain.
Another cause of rupture is the result of a balloon-like expansion of the blood vessels (a brain aneurysm) or from the blood vessel within the brain being badly formed.

Depending on the severity of the damage caused to the brain, the neurons that died will not grow back. However if the severity of the damage was significantly low, new connections between neurons can be made to provide some functionality back. (This is why you hear about patients that could move their fingers or show some other movement through therapy and rehabilitation)."
6113fe34,"Can someone recover completely from a stroke? If yes, how long does it take for a person to recover from a stroke?","That is an impossible question to answer. Each stroke is different and in a room full of 100 stroke victims, no two strokes will have been the same. How much of the brain died? Where exactly did the brain cells die? Strokes aren’t a hit and it’s over. A stroke continues for 24–48 hours with more brain cells dying every minute.
I had a major ischemic stroke. My right side was totally paralyzed head to foot and my speech was gone. Despite the years of therapy, I have not had a complete recovery. I recovered my speech after some time and with speech therapy, it’s not the same as before. But! I’m so glad I have it! I had occupational and physical therapy in the hospital for six weeks then at home 6 days/week for most of the year. Therapy is ongoing, for me, for the rest of my life. So recoveries are all different too. But therapy is forever. Or you can lose some of your past gains.
So the question asks about a complete recovery but with no details of the initial damage and losses or the kind of therapy and whether it was begun immediately. No one can give you the kind of answer you are looking for. Hasn’t the doctor discussed the prognosis with you? He alone would have the information needed for that assessment.
I wish you or the patient the best of luck!"
b636e8db,Can a person be fully recovered after brain stroke?,"Yes, a person can be fully recovered after brain stroke but it will depend on condition to condition.

33751d05,What did you do to help yourself recover from your stroke?,"My stroke happened in April of 2011. I was a freshman in college at the time, before the stroke, I was a very active student. I was in cross country and other sports in high school, so I never thought that I could have a stroke… at least not at that age.
My stroke was a hemorrhagic stroke which happened due to an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). When it ruptured, I went into a comma. While at the hospital, I had a respiratory failure, and the doctors said that I only had 10 percent chance of surviving. I survived. I did not really have any deficits after the Stroke. Like I mentioned before, I was a freshman in college, and because of the stroke, I had to drop off school.
After the stroke, all I wanted to do was to go back to school. In order to have my medical hold cleared, I had to undergo speech therapy. I could speak and have conversations, but the neurologists said that because of the location of rupture, the area of the brain that deals with planning and higher level thinking was affected. I did not feel any different from before. At least I did not notice a difference.
I was able to go back to school the following semester. I had constant medical visits to determine the best treatment for the AVM. At that time, my health was my main priority, school was not on the top of my list and I failed some classes. Now that I think about it, I should have listened to the therapist who told me to take a break. She said that my brain was not the same, but I was (or am) stubborn and did not listen.
After several MRIs and Angiograms, I underwent a radiation treatment. I was still going to school. I would go to the radiation treatment once a week for two hours for about three months, and then I would go to class. That semester, I also failed several classes. My GPA went below the requirements for my scholarships, but I was done with the treatment. My scholarship was “for four years, or until you gradate, whichever comes first”, so I could not afford to fall behind.
After that semester, I registered for summer classes in order to catch up with my graduation schedule. I took summer courses every summer until my senior year, and took 18 hours every semester. I was able to raise my GPA, and I graduated within four years.
So to answer your question: what really helped me recover from my stroke was being busy. I did not let the stroke change who I was or change the goals that I had. I was blessed because I did not have any deficits, but if you know someone whose life was dramatically changed after suffering a stroke, you should help him life have a life as normal as possible.
Thanks you for the question.

e2266812,How do you survive a stroke and recover completely as fast as possible?,There is no fast recovery from a stroke. It causes brain damage from loss of oxygen to. part of the brain either from a blood clot that impedes blood flow or from a brain bleed that cuts off blood supply to the areas beyond the bleeding. The degree of damage depends on what part of the brain is affected and how long the area was without oxygen. Typically if your symptoms improve it will be within six months of the stroke. If the symptoms don’t improve in that time the damage will probably be permanent. Therapy can teach you how to adapt to your disability and help you learn new ways to do things.
921bef3b,How long does it generally take to recover from stroke paralysis of one side of the body I'm 43,"Work at moving the paralyzed side. Movement typically starts small — the ability to make a fist. Work at it constantly while you are bored in bed or a wheelchair, whenever you are awake.
Watch your hand as you try because vision can augment functions that were lost. When you can make a fist, try to bend your elbow or wrist. Try to touch your thumb to each finger. Remember “Eency weensie spider” hand movements
? Try that. My mind remembered, but muscle memory was lost.
I am in my 50’s, a bit older than you. If you were active and strong prior to the stroke, it may help you recover faster. Eat lots of fruit and vegetables, clean fish, and nuts. Nourish your body with a variety of whole unprocessed foods. Take medications as prescribed and monitor your blood pressure. Exercise as much as you can, as often as you can.
Some exercises seem impossible at first, but you’ll be surprised how fast you improve if you keep trying. “Chair-ups” are done by lifting oneself with one’s arms without using your legs, while seated in a chair with strong arms. I could barely do one chair-up 8 weeks after my stroke, but I tried them 3x per day. 3 months after my stroke, I could do 10 chair-ups!"
168e5cb7,Can cannabis help a stroke patient recover?,"My neurologist just addressed this very topic with me on my last visit a couple of weeks ago. He brought it up because he said he’d seen some of his MS patients get better with cannabinoids (not the smoked cannabis, but medical grade stuff without THC or something or the other). I was then, and remain skeptical about how it could help me. My response to him is that I understand that it’s helpful for people experiencing pain and discomfort, of which I have virtually none.
So my answer to you is that it depends. Consult a doctor, and if you can obtain some measure of recovery with it, why not? In my case, I’ve even stopped taking muscle relaxants and Botox injections because their effect wasn’t evident. If someone could show that it helps eliminate spasticity so that I can improve form on my affected side, of course I’ll consider it.
You didn’t mention if you’re a stroke patient or doing research. Either way, good luck. I’d be curious what else you find."
6290d498,How long it takes for a person to recover from brain stroke?,"There is no long or short answer to this question as each stroke is unique; in that, no two individual strokes will affect a person the same!
My method is called Shak stroke therapy; I invented for my own father in 1986 purely to help him get well quicker than his physiotherapy was doing! His physiotherapist said it could take up to two years for him to be able to work again… I designed Shak therapy to help my father develop new neuro pathways at a much quicker rate and he was back at work after only 12 weeks… Since then I have developed shak therapy to a point where I have helped people recover fully, literally within minutes as you can see here on my youtube videos click here.
No actors are used in my videos. I have a book and video on sale at amazon
explaining exactly how to do Shak therapy The video has been circulating since about 2004 and has helped; countless number of people worldwide either fully recover or show improvement, where they thought, could never be any at all.
When I do a shak therapy, I never know until I meet the person what condition they are in or what type of stroke they have had? I July 2018 I met a guy called Chris who had a stroke and could not raise his right are above his head, he allowed me to video him after his Shak therapy with me that lasted just a few minutes. here is the video click here
then there are some people who can take four or five shak therapies before any difference is show… each person is unique. as a footnote, To date; I have NEVER charged one single penny from anyone that I personally have done Shak therapy too. as (to me) each one is classed as an experiment; because I tweak and fine-tune different methods that I use to speed up the process even more and without lovely people putting their trust in me; there would be no Shak stroke therapy at all.
I hope this has helped inspire you to try alternative methods that do work."
a93433b2,"Do you believe a person can recover from a major stroke? My husband suffered a massive stroke, a central main artery with occlusion stroke. I need some good hope as we face whatever is next.","OK. Let’s try for some good hope.
First, it’s impossible to say. The brain is quite plastic. It can’t repair itself, but it’s quite good at rewiring itself, working around injured areas and learning new functions when the previous brain areas aren’t able to perform them any more. The younger the person is, the more adaptable the brain is, but it’s still adaptable in people who are older. So there’s a reasonable/good possibility that your husband’s brain may be able to re-learn or adapt to his current condition.
Second, intensive rehabilitation can help, It’s best to begin as soon as possible and the most rapid progress is usually made in the first few months. On the other hand, progress can continue for years after the stroke or other brain injury.
Third, huge advances are being made in bionics, electronics, and other sorts of devices to help brain injury patients both recover and function.
None of that is a guarantee of anything. But some people make remarkable recoveries, or at least great progress. And the more work the patient and the family put into it, the greater the likelihood of progress. One piece of advice: Don’t take a physician’s pronouncement of “He’ll never be able to….again” very seriously. While the physician may be correct, you don’t know unless/until you try.
I interviewed the Pulitizer-prize winning columnist Art Buchwald several years after his massive stroke, and his progress was remarkable. And his isn’t an isolated story."
0459eda3,Why is it so hard to recover mentally after a stroke?,"…it depends on a number of factors the most important being the type of stroke and the period between the stroke and the first administered medical aid.
The brain has a property known as plasticity which is the ability to repurpose other close by parts to perform other functions. This all takes a great deal of time and needs the correct environment, internal and externally for this to happen. So, eating well and excercising will help promote this. Equally so will trying to learn/development of cognitive activities; music playing, language learning, juggling, yoga, tia chi etc
The effects of a stroke last a lifetime and so does recovery. Being patient and determined to recover will lead to greater improvements. It will happen."
bbf1a0d5,What factors make it likely to recover from stroke induced paralysis?,"I had a massive stroke in 2001 and lost all use of my right side my speech, and my right eye. Thankfully, I was young, 27, and I was told that would help in my recovery. It took almost 3 years of PT and occupational therapy to heal and recover almost all of my function. The brain does learn to find new pathways to send signals out to the body. It takes time. Lots of time.
As someone who had a stroke, I would like to tell you that your friends recovery can be frustrating for both of you.. She will need encouragement and yes, you'll have days where you have to push her harder than others and it will seem as if she is backsliding. Other days will be better for her. The best thing I can recommend, is to try to help her find as much humor in as many situations as you can. I've learned through many medical crises that laughter really does help your body to heal. It is better to laugh than to cry. Good luck."

That is when most people reach their peak function post stroke. Small gains can be made for a few years after, but usually they are adaptive gains, by which I mean they've adopted a new way to do something rather than had a massive physical improvement.
Its not the most pleasant to think about, and we always encourage hope and effort, but its important for families to be realistic, which means planning for life as it is now (at 6 weeks post) if gains happen thats great, if they don't they can be set up at home or residential care to cope with the new functional changes."
73645e2e,Chance of recovery from second stroke. My father had a second right brain stroke. He was recovering a quite well from first stroke that he had second stroke. What is his chance of recovery to the point of such patients where he recovered last time?,"Unfortunately, the medical doctors don’t tell people how to properly recover from and prevent strokes. Medical/allopathic doctors are in the business of selling drugs. Natural cures cannot be patented, so the pharmaceutical industry suppresses natural cures because it cannot make money off of them.
There are natural ways of treating and preventing stroke. There’s a book called Prescription for Natural Cures, which you might want to look at. You could also consider taking your dad to a naturopathic doctor. The naturopathic doctors are replacing the medical doctors.
keep in mind that the proper way of curing, treating, and preventing disease requires lifestyle changes. It’s a fantasy to think that just popping a pill is going to cure chronic diseases. Your father will need to change his diet and take the proper supplements."

I rely on typing things out to be understood.
It becomes what “recovered” means. If is “back to their old self,” then I am not. If it means “able to communicate and provide some care”, then I am. (I provide care by saying what to do. It’s like talking a plane down when there is no pilot.)

Despite, availability of stroke treatments, some simple ways helped my relative quicken his post-stroke recovery process without any treatment. Keeping a healthy and stress-free lifestyle was one of his mantra for fast recovery. Some of the other ways that helped him recover without any stroke treatments were:
-
Regular meditation: Since meditation helps in reducing stress, increasing focus, keeping one calm along with improving the overall health, it truly works wonders during recovery.
-
Healthy diet: What you eat is what you become. For stroke recovery, the creation of neurons is important. Despite the doctor’s prescribed medications, the consumption of vitamins in the form of food like fish, pomegranate, nuts, seeds, blueberries, etc became effective stroke
treatment

Good and enough sleep was another way to fasten the process of recovery for the brain."
d23ae0f1,How long will it take an ischemic stroke to recover?,"An aneurism, called a stroke since olden days, when it was believed you were stricken by a supernatural deity, is a lack of blood getting to parts of the brain. “Ischaemic”, means lack of blood. Asking how long it takes to recover is totally dependent on how serious the aneurism is. Transient Ischaemic Attacks or TIA are relatively minor and effects last about 24 hours with no permanent damage, but aneurisms can also kill immediately. In between TIA and a killer attack are a whole range of aneurisms.
For anyone, who has a stroke, suitable pills will be prescribed and the patient may last as long as Kirk Douglas, who is about to turn 101 years old and who had an aneurism about 30 years ago."
609eb2d0,Can fidget cubes help half body paralyzed stroke patients recover?,"I have had a major stroke and needed something to help me regain my fine motor skills. There weren't Fidget Cubes when I had my stroke and I wish there were. It's unfortunate that people are saying they wouldn't help. I know from experience that Fidget Cubes WOULD in fact assist with fine motor skills. I would think that questions like these should be answered by people with experience of having a stroke or physical therapists who specialize in recovery from strokes.
Fidget Cubes will not help you get your feeling back, obviously, but would assist in regaining your fine motor skills once you can start grasping items. I know when I was recovering at the rehab center, my therapist gave me all sorts of things to help. It was very difficult tending and releasing my hand grip. I would go to throw a ball, but my brain didn't send the message to release the ball when I was throwing it. Think of it like tricking your dog when you play fetch- that's what I kept doing.
It was also difficult to do everyday simple things we all take for granted like buttoning button. It took me years to regain this capability. Tying shoes. You'd think that's easy for someone that already knows how to tie a shoelace….but not after a stroke. I had to teach my hand to let go at the proper moment. Now, if you tie your shoe, really think about all the times you move your hands and all the times they released or loosing their grip. It's something that takes months to remaster after a stroke. So would Fidget Cubes help some with recovery of fine motor skills? The answer is yes. Thank you and this is in no way medical advice."
0b556caf,How do I regain strength after I have recovered from stroke?,"Consistent use of the affected side. I had a stroke 18 years ago. I came home from the hospital in a wheelchair and 2 children. An infant and a 16 month old. Well, mommy shed that wheelchair as fast as I could. I had a purpose. My babies couldn’t take care of themselves. The more I did, the stronger I got. Four years post stroke I walked 60 miles in the Avon three day breast cancer walk!
Funny how life changes. Now I’m getting severe arthritis in my unaffected hand. The affected hand HAS to do even more. One of the neatest observations I noted after my stroke was how my hands worked as a ‘team,’ when the left couldn’t function, the right would jump in and try to help his ‘friend.’ The right hand would actually instinctively reach over and try to do the work of the left side. I was constantly being told to put my unaffected hand down. I believe these days post stroke the unaffected side is restrained in order to MAKE the affected side work alone. I can see the benefits of this in therapy but long term I would’ve starved and I don’t think I would’ve recovered as quickly
So basically, what I am saying is the more you do for yourself the faster you will regain your strength. Do your exercises as prescribed. Work that affected side. But, do rest as much as necessary because when your brain takes such a ‘hit,’ the best medicine is to rest your brain. Rewiring pathways in your brain requires a lot of patience and energy.
Slow and steady, you will get better. Just never ever give up. The brain is an amazing organ! Best wishes!"
e5748c36,What can I do besides physiotherapy to recover from a stroke?,"I can only speak for what worked for me.
Attitude is everything.
I spent six months in rehab. The people who had strokes and had the attitude of “oh poor me, my life is over”, didnt progress a whole lot. The people who had the attitude of “ok, I am not staying like this, lets work on it” made a lot of progress.
However, attitude has to come from within. One can certainly encourage a better attitude, but ultimately, it has to come from within.
Other than the normal stuff the rehab professionals have you doing, this is what I did.
I had one sided neglect. So I wore a watch on that side, to remind me that side was there.
Everyday I had a trial size bottle of shampoo on the table. I would pick up my arm and close it around the bottle and try to lift it. Yes, it felt like it weighed 500lbs, but I eventually got it about 1/2 inch off the table. Took several months though.
I worked really hard in rehab and gave every exercise 100% effort.
When I went home, I continued with physio and did physio on my own.
I got an exercise ball. I sat on it everyday. Then try to sit on it, without holding on. Eventually sit on it and left one leg. Does wonders for balance.
Took me two years, but I got out of that wheelchair. Since the day I decided I dont need a chair, I never ever sat in it again. Ever. It is too easy to let yourself slide back, because it is easier.
I accepted nothing less then becoming independent again. It is A LOT of work and can take a long time.
Last year, 17 years post my last stroke, I hiked half of the camino frances. I still have issues, walk with a cane. Its all good, it could have ended up being so much worse and I thank my lucky stars that it isnt.
ATTITUDE."
8b7165d1,Did you recover 100% from a stroke?,"Well, yes and no.
Now, I had a stroke at birth. Due to my mother’s very high blood pressure, it was going to be either her or me. It was me. It affected me learning to walk on-time, hand-eye coordination and my speech were impacted. To this day, close to 41 years later, I still have poor hand-eye coordination, and when tired or when I try to run I drag my left leg behind me. Because of this issue, I never wanted to play in sports and hated physical education classes when young when I had to do physical things where others would notice how I ran, or my poor coordination. I’m not good at catching things. Now, I did learn how to skip, and I can skip along pretty fast. Not that it is a valuable life skill by any means.
In my stroke, my left side and speech had been impacted the most and it was my mother who ran my rehab program. “You want that toy? Well, you have to go get it yourself.” She told me that just last week, too. I’m kidding. Seriously, though, she worked with speech therapists to help me pronounce L’s properly, and the dreaded TH phonetic, and another letter or phonetic I’m forgetting. Thanks to my Mom and her hard work, I can speak eloquently and clearly. However, thanks to her Southern United States accent, and my Dad from Upstate New York I sound like I’m either from the Midwest area or Canada.
I am now, thankfully, able to walk and talk and even at the same time. That may sound like a joke, but depending on the severity of the stroke that is a real issue not to be laughed at. I’m also very independent, able to drive, and I’m able to do as much as possible for myself as I’m also going through rehabilitation for my left shoulder after surgery."
f7631767,"Can someone that had a stroke, who can't talk, and move the right part of their body completely recover?","Good therapy and strong will can go a long way toward improvement. Generally, however, a stroke needs to be intercepted with clot busting drugs within an hour of symptoms, unless it’s a hemorrhagic stroke, to minimize damage and improve outlook. Rehabilitation services can help minimize complications and may include working with:
a physical therapist to restore movement
an occupational therapist to learn how to perform daily tasks, such as activities involving personal hygiene, cooking, and cleaning
a speech therapist to improve speaking ability
a psychologist to help cope with feelings of anxiety or depression"
38cc38bd,How long would it take a 28-year-old to recover fully from stroke paralysis?,"Hi there, thank-you for the A2A and sorry for the delay in response.
Due to the nature of stroke, and the many different symptoms it can present with depending on the region in which the stroke occurred it is difficult to put an exact time-frame on recovery.
Multiple teams work together collaboratively using equipment, medication and physical treatment in order to regain function in the case of paralysis amongst other symptoms.
From the physiotherapy point of view our main objectives are as follows:
To reduce any further adaptions of the body in terms of shortening of muscles, and reduced range of motion available at joints.
To maintain muscle conditioning in un-affected muscles
To encourage use of effected limbs, even if involuntary (manual manipulation)
Physiotherapy, as with other medical disciplines is most effective when implemented as early as possible.
In terms of long-term outcome from stroke, and how quickly someone may recover from paralytic effects depends on how quickly the above bullet-pointed are put into action alongside other factors such as patient compliance, and integration from the medical team re. medications and equipment.
Some other factors determining prognosis are as follows:
Age
The younger a person is, the more adaptable the brain is to recovery and therefore the better the prognosis
Pre-morbid activity levels
Increased activity and general fitness prior to stroke incident is a strong indicator for fast recovery
Environment
How supportive family members are
Recovery environment e.g. is the person on a specialist stroke ward?
Pharmacology
How well a person responds to certain drugs involved within the treatment of stroke.
As you can see it’s not very easy to apply a time scale to recovery as there are so many influencing factors, determining the extent to which recovery may or may not occur.
It is important to note that in most cases full recovery does not occur and people will be left with varying levels residual symptoms which may or may not impact everyday living.
However discounting all of the above here is a simple template time frame for expected stroke recovery:
6 weeks
The most intense period of treatment in order to make full use of the adaptability of the brain and neurons in within the early period
3 months
Most recovery gains will be achieved within this period and physiotherapy will remain an integral factor during this period
6 months
Most of the recovery which will be achieved will have occurred by now but it not unsaid that minor gains can still occur for up to 2 years.
Hope this gives you a basic picture as to what you could expect to see recovery wise in terms of time frame and the factors influencing prognosis.
Thank-you once again for the A2A (it helps with my studies to re-evaluate what I have learnt). :)"
ec4d545d,Can antidepressants help in recovering memory and language skills after a stroke?,"There is some mild evidence that SSRI’s (paxil, lexapro etc) may help facilitate with recovery after a stroke. I do not think it is an overwhelming help, unfortunately. Treating post-stroke depression is also an important goal in itself."
43bad3c1,How long does it take to recover from a cerebellar stroke?,"From my personal perspective, no: but I have made vast improvements in the last 20 years. I was a foreign language instructor, mainly in Spanish, so being speechless is rather self-conscious for me, especially in being a teacher. I still have aphasia but I've “fully"" recovered considering that the stroke was a fluke: no prescriptions (as of now even though I was at least on 15 medications fed through my stomach tube which lasted for about 6 months), no high blood pressure, and certainly not the obesity factor. So keep on living, my friend…never give up!"
7bc7be0d,Is sudden trouble with vision from one or both eyes normal while recovering from a stroke?,"I had a white light spectrum aura in an almost 45 degree angle in both eyes. It came about 3 to 4 days after the stroke, and lasted almost 2 weeks. That was due to the inflammation and edema, and the pressure it creates after the stroke. That’s how my arm and leg got progressively worse AFTER the stroke, too. A delay of 3 weeks before the final symptoms “set”. I finally noticed how bad it was when taking a shower and couldn’t lift my arm above my shoulder (got home slept mostly, really tired so didn’t notice). Too stiff to raise.
So despite the stroke happening weeks before, stroke damage can and does continue due to the inflammation/edema/pressure that occurs after the stroke. That’s the white haze you see in MRIs. The original lesion looks more like a peanut for a lacunar lesion or walnut (or larger) for a larger stroke in size.
MRI/CT of a lesion area looks like this about 3 days later…
Notice the white field? That’s the inflammation and edema that comes after a stroke. While that inflammation and edema exists damage continues due to the pressure it causes in the area. In 6 weeks only a faint white field exists.
In the newer MRIs with higher resolutions the details of a fresh lesion can be seen. Why I describe mine as looking like a walnut in it’s shape, size and creases (I was in the ER in less than 15 minutes after the stroke). 3–4 days later MRI can’t even see the lesion anymore due to the white field.
So that is WHY you can have vision problems even weeks after a stroke. More inflammation and edema builds up, the pressure it creates, causes it to press against the CN nerves, and if it’s mid-brain stroke, the Thalamus LGN and Corona Radiations can be affected.
It’s eerie seeing like the Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon album cover before your eyes, and seeing the “light” scatter like atoms under a MRI. Then to have it all disappear leaving a water drop like scotoma that remains permanent."

521efcec,How do I recover a lost memory from a brain stroke?,"This is a A2A so I will do my best. When I had my stroke, I was in a parking lot 50 miles away from home. But, what I remember is, I was watching a movie in my house with my Girlfriend. I then woke up in an ICU with a tube down my throat. I tried to pull the tube out because I had no idea what had happened (Car wreck, explosion ect.) and the staff were calling me Bob (No one calls me Bob it’s kind of a thing) so I thought something must have happened to my Girlfriend since she would have told them never to call me Bob.
They had to tie me down and heavily sedate me. They could not figure out what was wrong with me. Unbeknownst to me, my GF had been there many times I had just not been awake. Well one night I woke up and on the white board, in my GF’s handwriting was the message “Don’t call him Bob. His name is Robert.”
Well I settled down immediately because I knew my Girlfriend ok.
So to answer the question. I lost 3 days before my stroke. I remember nothing. When I had the stroke, I was robbed (That’s a different story) so I was able to track my iphone and answer some questions. However, no matter how many people I talk to, I remember not a thing. Sorry.
I like to say that the worst thing about having a stroke is, until you try to remember it, you don’t know what you’ve forgotten. Sometimes it’s an Actors name or just the correct word. For the most part, however, except for those 3 days, I do eventually remember."
03cb372c,"How long does it take to recover from a minor stroke if the person can talk, walk and lost no function?","I had my fist series of strokes on January 31, 2020 and I was 60, but a “very young looking and hard to believe 60 yr old” female. I was getting dressed that morning as I had the day off and I began having an ocular migraine but without any headache. They call them ocular auras and I began having those several years prior with a diagnosis of “nothing can be done and just deal with them”. Over the past two years prior the auras got increasingly frequent and longer, often up to 45 minutes but I sucked it up and learned to keep working while they were happening, Unknown to anyone who may have been around me had no idea I was experiencing one. That morning was a quick aura when I reached to pick up my cell phone my left hand would not work. Hmm I thought this was a bit odd so I picked it up with my right hand and tried to text my hubby and was unable to distinguish the icons on the phone. As 20 minutes passed I awoke my son and asked him to help me find the icon on my phone so I could call his father and he looked at me with an oddity replying what do you mean you can’t find the keypad because you use your phone constantly. He immediately had me do the Stroke symptom indicators and saw nothing odd so we passed it off as an oddity. About half hour later I decided to drive over to my hubby’s work a bit earlier than planned for our lunch date and while on the highway I got very confused at the traffic lights and my vision began having black out spots. I have never experienced that type of confusion. I managed to pull into a strip mall center and sat there until nausea overwhelmed me. Still not really grasping what was happening, after the nausea subsided I proceeded to try and make my way to my hubby’s work place but continued to experience the same confusion symptoms. I managed to get to his work with the confusion but still partially mentally aware. When I walked into his office he took one look at me and told me I was having or had had a stroke. Off to the ER, all sorts of testing, diagnosis was a series of 4 strokes over that two hour span of time. BTW, the MRI brought on claustrophobia which I’ve never thought I had. Stayed in hospital for 2 days, left with meds and NO determination on where the stroke originated from. Cholestrol was off the charts as well. Went back to work 4 days later with inability to use my left hand and missing spots in my vision. No one knew but my boss. I was VERY Lucky! Today, after a year, I feel pretty normal and can use my left hand almost 100%, but vision loss spots are permanent. I’ve lost 30 lbs, greatly improved my cholesterol numbers, eat only chicken, fish, fruits and yogurt, lol and walk 2–4 miles everyday. It’s been a lifestyle change but I still think about and fear another stoke everyday. The first 8 months the stroke fear consumed me and I’m still in fear but have managed to let go of the stress, appreciate my day to day living and enjoy every minute I can, thankful to still be here. I wrote this because I still feel the odd things from having had stroke but to encourage you to not ignore the symptoms. I had them all, high cholesterol, middle age belly fat, tingling in my left hand and face and lips, but blew it off because I was too busy taking care of everyone and everything. I miss the old me, but a new me emerged and thank the Lord there must be a reason he spared me."
0ec3e5d8,How long will it take to recover from stroke due to blood loss?,"It will take as long as it takes. A stroke is serious in itself but with the blood loss they have to stabilize your physical condition first. After the doctors do that, they have to assess you to determine what caused the events ( the stroke and blood loss) fix those problems and determine what damage was done. Then they will try to help you recover the faculties you may have lost due to the event.
Rehabilitation depends on the type of damage done , the severity of the damage, and the strength and will of the patient. There is no set time period for rehabilitation. The therapists will work with the patient until they feel he has recovered as many of his faculties as he is able or until the patient’s insurance cuts off coverage.
Everyone PLEASE remember that you CAN appeal insurance denials."
857bdfc1,How do I recover speech after a brain stroke?,"Short-Term Therapy May Help Speech
In the study, researchers examined the effects of a short-term, intensive round of speech therapy in 27 stroke survivors who had suffered from language impairment for about four years.
Each of the stroke survivors received 30 hours of language training three hours a day for 10 days; their language skills were assessed before and immediately after the training as well as six months later.
The results appear in the June edition of Stroke.
The speech therapy used a technique called constraint-induced aphasia therapy or CIAT, which combines intense verbal communication training with language games that build simple as well as complex language skills.
The technique encourages stroke patients to speak rather than using gestures as their primary means of communication.
The results showed that language skills improved significantly in 85% of the stroke patients after the intensive speech therapy, and those improvements were sustained for six months.
Researchers also found that the improvement occurred regardless of the stroke survivor's age or the severity of his or her language impairment.
In addition, the study showed that 15 stroke patients who received additional language training, which was reinforced by family members and friends, showed further improvements.
The psychologist applies a combination of non-invasive methods (fMRI– functional magnetic resonance imaging and TMS – transcranial magnetic stimulation) to deduce what happens in the brain during the test. “We thus proved that the left hemisphere, as expected, was activated during speech production, while the right hemisphere did not actively contribute to language function”, explains Hartwigsen. This is the regular functionality within a healthy brain. From these results as well as others, scientists had up to now deduced that the right hemisphere did not contribute to speech production in the healthy system and was therefore suppressed."
80717499,Is it possible for a 50 year old woman to fully recover after being paralyzed due to brain stroke for 5 years?,"Is this woman receiving physical therapy? Are her muscles being passively exercised? Both of these would improve chances of any degree of recovery. What has she been doing the past 5 years. Were both sides of her body involved (which would place the stroke in a different location than if only one side is impaired)? All this information is critical in determining prognosis
To understand motor recovery, lets look at the worst case scenario,-Hemispherectomy- where half the brain is removed due intractable epilepsy,
Immediately after surgery, the entire opposite half of the body is paralyzed.
Extensive therapy begins almost immediately.
The younger the person is at the time of surgery, (typically infants) the better the recovery, Walking seems to be the first to improve. Some use of the arm follows. Fine motor coordination (fingers) seems impaired or lacking, even in children. In some cases,. the arm may be able to help in very simple tasks,. In others, it remains limp at the side.
The adult brain is less plastic than the child's and the final result may not be as satisfactory.
Christopher Reeve, who was paralyzed at the neck, described a procedure frequently used in rehab, in which the patient is placed in a body harness and suspended from the ceiling over a treadmill. He is positioned so that his feet touch the treadmill.
When the motor is turned on and the platform begins to move), the feet show reflexive walking behavior (this is organized in the spinal cord). This type of activity maintains muscle tone in the legs (should any small reco9very occur, the leg muscles will not have atrophied) and also is related to a spontaneous ability for the patient to go into reflexive motion when standing on a regular floor
Current research in restoration of motor function also involves the implantation of electrodes into the muscles and stimulating them electrically. Signals to implement motion are taken directly from the patients brain"

sixth - twelfth month: I’m no good to anybody like this. I’d rather kill myself than go through any more rehab. Please just let me die =(
twelth month - fifth year: yeah, this pretty much sucks.
Fifth year - tenth year: this definitely sucks.
tenth year - present: I’ve discovered a therapy that may actually work. I have felt at normal energy for weeks at a time. Then it stopped working. =( I’ve gone back to my doc for touch-ups, which work for a little while, and then I’m exhausted again.

7e26cc4b,What is the a way to recover after having a stroke?,"Strokes (the ""brain attack"" variety) have diverse manifestations, ranging from no effect to life threatening illness. Thus, there is no one answer to this question.
Assuming a degree of disability, the following are likely to improve recovery:
1. rapid hospitalisation (after onset) with ""clot buster"" treatment in appropriate cases <reduce severity of disability>
2. management in an organised stroke unit, with input from appropriate therapists <maximise recovery>
3. a positive bent of mind (easier said than done) with family support and psychologist input if needed - this is akin to steady training like marathon runners do <psychological health is essential to any form of training>
4. it is important to continue prescribed medications to reduce risk of future stroke. No medications known to improve recovery from a stroke that has already occurred.
Clearly, these are generic principles and may not apply for your particular situation.
Do get specialist input if you haven't already.
Good luck."

e84a8ce3,What is the best way to recover from a stroke if one side is weak and the knees knock because of it?,"Neurological rehabilitation is the best approach to improving functionality and mobility after a stroke. Rehab hospitals generally have an outpatient rehab group to help stroke patients continue recovering after discharge from acute rehab.
Part of the problem may be that the stroke survivor doesn’t feel where his/her knees are. That ability is called “proprioception.” I had a problem like that with an ankle. It would roll and unless I was looking in a mirror, I couldn’t tell. Initially, I used a brace. I strengthened the ankle and didn’t need the brace after a while, but walking barefoot in the house, my ankle rolled, I didn’t realize and put my full weight on the foot, breaking two of the long bones (2nd & 3rd metatarsals).
Strengthening and weight bearing through the joints will help, but take it slowly and be careful! I should not have been walking around barefoot."
625ddb86,Have you ever had a stroke and completely recovered?,"A person who had a stroke never “completely recovers”. A lesion causes damage. They can recover if their stroke avoided critical areas of the brain, to the point they are functional, and can return to many of their interests again. It’s like a broken leg. The bone will heal, yet they may walk with a limp afterwards.
Even the mildest strokes offers challenges to work around the damage. Some minor strokes can actually have some serious syndromes; while massive strokes may be limiting only to movement or speech.
While every human is from the same species, anatomically we are varied. Blood vessels can grow differently, as well as pathways in the brain can. Check the veins in your hands. Compare it even with a sibling. Notice they’re different? Which is why when a stroke happens in two people with the exact same type of stroke, each can have two different outcomes. A lesion in XYZ area may have missed a pathway in patient A due to anatomical variance; while in patient B it landed squarely on it and is really debilitated.
What matters is WHAT was damaged, and working around that damage. That’s work around is called, neuroplasticity, a bridging to other areas of the brain that, though cruder, can restore some/most function again.
When I had my stroke my vision was damaged. Everything was like seeing things under water. Then days later half my vision was replaced with a white light spectrum in both eyes. I was scared I would go blind. It eventually faded away and left a water spot type scar and visual snow. I lost my night vision, too. Over time, and use, my vision is well enough that I don’t walk into walls. Those changes were possible by neuroplasticity (the saying of “use it or lose it” is true with brain traumas. More you use the function the more the brain will compensate for the loss). What is gained isn’t what the person had before, but the person can return to things they once did again, if their stroke didn’t land on ground zero. Some changes are permanent, but a lot can return with rehab."

459ffb50,How can stroke victims recover? Where are the best hospitals to treat stroke victims?,"While rehab centers and hospitals can be very helpful for those recovering from strokes, rehabilitation - such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy - can often occur at home, depending on the severity of the stroke, type(s) of disability, and community resources.
The best hospital for treating acute strokes, on the other hand, is often the CLOSEST one, assuming they have a neurologist available with experience diagnosing and treating strokes. The long-term prognosis for those with strokes is greatly improved by urgent treatment, provided within minutes to hours of symptom onset.
Treatments often are available to dissolve or remove the offending clot that is causing an ischemic stroke (damage from oxygen deprivation to part of the brain, usually when a blood vessel is blocked by a clot). Other strategies may be used to stop bleeding during a much less common hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the brain).
But any of these treatments must be provided very, very quickly. Lost minutes mean lost brain function.
If you or someone you are with seems to be having a stroke, with sudden numbness and/or weakness (often one-sided), slurred speech, confusion, dizziness, loss of coordination, vision changes, very severe headache, or other new neurologic symptoms, call an ambulance immediately. Don’t try to transport yourself or the other person to the hospital. Call an ambulance to get help right away and treatment started as soon as possible."

ff25a00a,What is it like to have a major stroke and recover?,"Recovery is a long process — my brain hemorrhage was 4 1/2 years ago and I’m still doing my PT exercises every day. I expect I’ll continue to do therapy for the rest of my life because if I stop working at recovery, my recovery stops.
I was in the ICU for two weeks and in acute care another six weeks for rehab. After that, I had six weeks of in-home therapy before “graduating” to outpatient therapy. Until COVID, I did a few weeks of therapy every few months to update my program.
Amazingly, I’m walking and using both hands, though the affected side is clumsy. I credit my therapists with my recovery. I thought I’d never walk again or be able to care for myself.
I was out of work for five months, then tried to return, working part-time for a year before my doctors told me it was too much for me. I’m now on disability.
Buy disability insurance! SSDI is not much and it takes forever to qualify, even when one has a medical file as comprehensive as mine. Disability is more common than early death, so disability insurance is as important as life insurance. I’d gotten a policy decades ago and it paid off. I am grateful I don’t have to worry about income."

2a0a9a3d,What are some good ways to help someone recover brain function after a stroke?,"What are some good ways to help someone recover brain function after a stroke?
I’m not a neurologist and never had a stroke.
So what am I doing here?
I’m told my brain injury rehab was not dissimilar from some stroke rehab protocols. I trust folks with personal or professional stroke experience will write answers and also let me know what I got wrong and what’s missing.
Usually, people who’ve stroked work on cognitive issues with neurologists; mental health professionals; cognitive rehabilitation therapists; speech and language therapists; and occupational therapists.
I suffered an acquired brain injury nine years ago. I worked with all of the above - and each professional also provided services to stroke survivors.
I was incredibly fortunate and recovered ~ 90%.
I found a few good (audio*) books with helpful cognitive exercises, tips to accommodate my deficits, and at least one about adjusting to - and grieving - my new normal.
Supportive friends and family, meeting others in my situation, and therapy were invaluable. As was Jim. And the dogs.
We tagged that experience as “the time when mommy’s brain fell out”. Pretty catchy, right?
*I never recovered my ability to read. I miss holding books - though Audible must appreciates my deficit:)

d96a6f03,How much water is too much when recovering from a heat stroke?,"I agree with Dr. Jay. Heatstroke is something totally different from heat exhaustion or simple dehydration.
The amount of time spent in the intensive care unit really depends on the severity of the “stroke”. Individuals with pre-existing heart or kidney disease will spend longer in the ICU than those without these issues.
Close monitoring is essential by both the nursing and medical staff. In order to manage fluid requirements closely, both fluid input and output will be determined and charted, labs monitored, and physical exam changes consistent with fluid overload noted — many times a day if required. The patient will typically be restricted as to how much fluid is taken by mouth. Patients permitted to drink ad lib can develop water intoxication resulting in cerebral edema, which if it happens, places the patient in dire straits, indeed.
Responses should be considered general in nature, and not specific to any one person; consequently, they are not to be construed as specific medical advice and do not create a doctor/patient relationship. For more specific advice unique to your particular situation, consult a local medical professional."
d78e6f6b,How do I recover my mom from stroke paralysis in the past year?,"Recovery from stroke paralysis depends on degree of paralysis and underlying health condition. Also timely treatment of stroke also helps in limiting the degree of paralysis and thus helps faster recovery.
In this case the paralysis is a year old. You have not mentioned whether any physical rehabilitation have been done till date. Most important in such cases is to perform limb movements active or passive depending on severity of paralysis. For this in your case home based physiotherapy program will be suitable.
Also it is important to prevent stroke recurrence by keeping Diabetes and blood pressure under control."
a77cdcf7,"What can a woman in her 70s use as a peg tube for water and nutritional drinks to cure her diabetes, arteriosclerosis, and recover from a stroke?","There is diet which is effective in treating cardiovascular diseases and diabetes at the same time. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Director of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Reversal Program at the Cleveland Clinic has reversed arterial plaque buildup in his patients by putting them on whole-food (not refined or processed) plant-based (WFPB) diet. Below is a angiographic imaging evidence of reversal of plaque buildup in coronary artery of one of his patients by going on WFPB diet. Image A is before going on WFPB diet, and image B is after being on WFPB diet for 32 months. You can see that severe plaque buildup has been removed from the coronary artery after being on WFPB diet.
This is opposite to what many doctors believe, which is that coronary artery diseases can not be reversed and one needs to take medication for rest of the life and if the condition becomes severe, the person needs to have surgical intervention. But the above evidence shows it otherwise.
Former president Clinton had quadruple bypass surgery and he was still having problems. He went on WFPB diet as per advices of Dr. Esselstyn and Dr. Dean Ornish and he is fine now (He has also lost weight). He credits that diet to him still being alive today
The WFPB diet includes vegetables, beans, fruits, and whole grains, but excludes meat, fish, eggs and dairy. Also no processed foods or added sugar (need to read labels as items may contain processed ingredients or fructose corn syrup etc). Esselstyn recommends little or no oil as it is an extract of food and thus not whole food. For those, who have had prior cardiac event (for example, stroke or heart attach), he recommends not to comsume oil at all. (One needs to take Vitamin B12 supplements, as both, those on plant-based diet and those who are omnivores, have been found to be Vitamin B12 deficient, more so for plant-based group, as their foods are generally not fortified with B12 supplements).
Dr. Esselstyn has followed 200 patients, who had prior cardiac event. He put them on WFPB diet. About 90 percent of patients fully complied with the diet and they did not have subsequent cardiac event over the years. Of the 10 percent who did not comply, 65 percent had subsequent cardiac events.
The WFPB diet has also been used to reverse diabetes. Dr. Neal Barnard, an NIH diabetes researcher and a professor at George Washington University School of Medicine has reversed diabetes in his research studies and in his patients by changing their diet to WFPB. The following video link is a very informative and interesting presentation by him about cellular level mechanism of insulin resistance and how diet can reverse the insulin resistance and thus diabetes. The cause of the insulin resistance is fat in the muscle cells, and the whole food plant based diet (no meat, fish, eggs or dairy and little or no oil) reduces this muscle cell fat theirby reversing type 2 diabetes. In a study, the whole food plant based diet with little oil reduced HgA1c levels better than diet recommended by ADA (Americans Diabetic Association). This diet also reduces weight without counting calories. I know a couple of people, who based on such a diet, have seen positive results in terms of weight loss (without counting calories) and their HbA1c levels.
People often control the symptoms of diabetes by reducing carbs consumption, but it is the fat in muscle cell, which stops cells from metabolizing blood sugar. Thus one needs to reduce this muscle cell fat to reduce the cellular level insulin resistance to reverse the diabetes, rather than always trying to control the symptoms by limiting carbs. (For example, fiber is very important in controlling and reversing diabetes and fiber is a carbohydrate. All vegetables are carbohydrates. Although, one needs to avoid refined and processed carbs). Here is a video link for the presentation by Dr. Barnard. Very informative.
The same diet also has effect on type 1 diabetes. The following figure shows reduction in insulin dose for both type of diabetes upon changing the diet (to whole food plant based diet) only for few days.
You will see people often recommend low carb high fat diet for diabetes, but it not only does not reverse diabetes as explained above, the high fat diet can be bad for cardiovascular health. While the above diet (whole-food plant-based diet with very little oil) is heart-healthy as discussed above.
Here are some expert opinions (such as American Heart Association, American Cancer Society, American Hea, American Dietetic Association, American Medical Association, etc.) on dangers of low-carb, high-fat or high-protein diet.

c3571ada,Can a patient still recover after a left brain stroke?,"Depending on the severity and region affected; patient’s health and personality, “recovery” will come in stages. Priority is to get them mobile and to be independent in their care as much as possible.
That priority of walking again sometimes causes problems later, as the window of opportunity for neuroplasticity (the body’s ability to use secondary areas of the brain to compensate and work around brain injured infarct[s]) to work is generally 1 year (it’s longer than a year, but faster a stroke survivor retrains from a loss of function, the better the outcomes are — i.e., walking/gait rehab over hand/arm therapy as a priority, is a problem in stroke recovery and why so many can walk again, but their hand/arm maybe paralyzed and speech therapy isn’t the priority before moving out of bed).
MCA strokes (more common in the West) mostly occur in the Left Hemisphere, as the body tries to protect it’s Right Hemisphere (where cognition/executive function is located, and so essential to survive). The location of MCA strokes also places it near the Broca’s area of the brain responsible for speech. Why so many MCA stroke survivors have the tell-tale F.A.S.T stroke signs (“S” being speech impairment).
My grandfather had a MCA stroke and they told him he would never walk again. Wrong talk! Before he died, grandpa was walking with a cane again and driving himself around like before. That was in the 1970s. Rehab today is 10x better than that, and they get patient up and moving in just days.
It won’t be a “miracle” recovery (neuroplasticity relies on using secondary area[s] of the brain to regain use of affected areas of the brain again), but they can recover enough to return to their life as before."

I would not even let you work out in my gym or school if that was the case because the risk is too great and liability wise if something was to happen then I would be on the hook for a serious lawsuit from your heirs.
I actually have been in that situation where a student working out developed problems and died enroot to the hospital in the ambulance. Luckily I had done everything including making him get a doctor’s clearance to resume working out before this happened. The lawyers and his family had no place to go legally because of that and suing me which they were considering doing. While I also had insurance for this that insurance does not cover negligence on my part and that is what it would have been if I had not made him get that medical clearance given the medical issues he had earlier when he first started working out at my school."
024cfafb,"How do I cope w/ my boyfriend being more attentive, affectionate, and loving to our dog than me while I try to recover from a stroke?","Boys always love their dogs more than girls. Reason is, as girls, given an opportunity, we would stress them out so much with our demands and we do appear too needy at times.
Many girls are even be highly dependent on their boyfriends and in fact many make boyfriends for the same reason.
But dogs are so cute, adorable, always loving and affectionate, always giving more love and loyalty to boys, never very demanding, enjoy time endlessly with boys.
That may be the reason that your boyfriend loves his dog and wants to give more time to his dog. But if you need care and he doesn't care for you, we can't attribute it to his love and attention for his dog. It's you. Maybe it's time for you to move on? Think about it. Maybe all your boyfriend needs is peace and love with his dog and he doesn't find that good connection with you anymore. You might want to rethink your relationship because if he is not caring for you but has time for someone else, you might be left alone sooner than you. It's better to be prepared than to be sorry in life."

When a blood vessel in the brain is blocked at that time you face the situation of stroke and it is also called a cerebral vascular accident(CVA). There are two types of stroke ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic which I have seen commonly in every people.
Physical therapy is very useful for stroke and it is not painful, if anyone said it is painful then it is totally a myth. If you consult good therapist then it will very helpful to recover from a stroke because he/she examines and evaluating your condition and after that gives you solution how to fight against stroke, suggest you best exercise for your body, gives you some activities which will help you to strengthen your muscles and body. This all are helpful in stroke attack and many studies have found physical therapy can help improve mobility, balance, and muscle strength.

My husband and daughter got training in how to help me once I was almost ready to go home. My daughter then cleared throw rugs and other trip hazards and cleared the path from my bed to the toilet. She also got non-slip mats for the bathroom and a tub-bench to help me with showering. My husband had a rail installed on the stairs and a bar beside the toilet. All these were really helpful and much appreciated.

I managed to bork the OTHER side of my basal ganglia, which seems to have made me permanently exhausted. =( None of the ADD medication I took subsequent to my second stroke wakes me up anymore. It is a seemingly small, intractable, enormous problem. It sucks. I’m over it. I’m probably stuck with it for life.
But, in addition to my fatigue (and my increased sensitivity to sunlight and noise, my increasingly tiny handwriting, and my increasingly worse aphasia), I became depressed after my third stroke. I don’t know whether it was because people with left-brain strokes routinely become depressed or whether, after six months of dealing with this sh!t after the second stroke I was just over it, and I will never know, but man … depression sucks. I would pay good money to never, ever feel that way again. Do you remember the effect of the dementors in Harry Potter? It’s like they flew into my house and sucked out all the heat, all the love, and all the things that make life worth living. (Of course, you could also argue that’s exactly what the strokes did. You can see my confusion as to what caused the depression!)
Two things helped me deal with my depression: first of all, my depression led me to try Wellbutrin, which, thanks be to God!, woke me up. Not quite as spectacularly as Adderall, but it also doesn’t make me feel high all the time ;) (Which is a good thing. I feel normal on Wellbutrin.) Second of all, my husband was very up-front about it all; there was no hushed whispering about his “nutty wife”, no hesitancy to get me on medication, no reluctance to find me a counselor. I love that about him! You can certainly do that for your loved one: you can be the strong advocate for help, if they’re willing to take it.
Unfortunately, if you’ve seen one stroke, you’ve seen one stroke — they’re so different that without more information I really can’t say, “You need a top-notch physical therapist”, “You need to go to Timbuktu to see a shaman”, or “You need to feed her lots of chocolate” — though the last one never hurts ;)
Best of luck to you and your loved one!"

634e6e77,"I met with an accident and had a stroke. Somehow, I survived, but I didn't recover completely. Will I get a normal lifespan? I don't have any bad habit. My age is 21, and I was born in 2000.","Let go everything and simply meditate for a while now, dear. That's what you need to do at first. I suggest that you practice the guided meditations for beginners by Sri Sri in YouTube.
Will you listen if I tell you one thing,dear? Let's not think about how long we will live. Let's not even bother about that. It's your quality of life that matters, not the quantity. Isn’t it?
Let's be in the present,without thinking too much about the past and future. Let's start to focus on each day at a time. Have you been happy today? Very good if you have been happy. If you have not been happy today, be happy now dear. :) The day is still far from over. :)
There are so many things that you can do to be happy. Listen to some music or play musical instruments,read a good book that uplifts you or write something. Chant mantras like Om namah Shivaya for a few minutes,do pranayama,Sudarshan kriya and meditate for a while. All these can make you so happy! You have to do these to experience that.
Let's count how many happy moments we have had today. The more the happy moments,the better the day has been for us. It's the measure of the quality of life-how many happy moments we have had.
Let every day of ours make us satisfied-that we have utilized the day fully. How to have that satisfaction? Engage in some selfless service daily(at least an hour daily). Then you can have that satisfaction. At the end of the day, when you retire for the night(go to sleep),you can be satisfied that I have utilized my day fully-I did what I should have done. Along with selfless service,we need to meditate for a few minutes everyday.
I suggest that you attend any one of the following programs of the Art of Living:
Online meditation and breath workshop(Happiness program)
Online Sahaj samadhi dhyana yoga
YES! +
You must attend any one of these as soon as possible."
9444f8cd,How expensive is it to recover from a stroke?,"First of all, I suspect that nobody has recovered fully from a stroke. Personally, I’ve done pretty well — to the point that doctors have seen me, done a couple cursory examinations, and prounounced me “all better”. That’s when I pronounce them to be idiots ;)
I suspect it’s really expensive.
I probably received a couple hundred thousand dollars of therapy, a hundred thousand in hospital stays, an extra 50k of hospital visits when I was pregnant because it’s thought that pregnancy hormones may have contributed to my strokes — and that’s not even considering the lost income or the insane charge I’ve racked up with Lyft because I can no longer drive.
However, all this pales in comparison to … well, to losing myself. I grieved for myself for a long time. I didn’t do it publicly, but privately? You betcha! I prayed that God would just release me from this body with a broken brain. That I wouldn’t have to live another day terrified that a truck would drive by me as I walked the dogs around the block because the noise made me freak out. That the sun would just go behind a cloud, because having it shine in my face HURT my poor eyes. That I could wake up the person I used to be; be there for my husband like I used to be; become a mom like I’d wanted to; etc."

At this time, you still can’t ‘wake up’ your affected arm and hand. Still, you need a RockTape binds up your subluxation shoulder. Walk a little around your neighborhood or go to the mall. My West Asheville neighborhood has a bunch of hills. Go for climbing stairs. Now, relax. Drive a car. Hike a hill. Do exercise with your arm and lie on your bed. Do yoga! I choose aikido, martial art of Japan. Do horseback riding (I love it so much! The rush catapult me to orgasmic runner high). I tremble for tango. I do it every Tuesday at night. I and my AlonTree Team make neulogical equipment for me and for YOU! Oh. Right. In December of ‘08, I had a catastrophic massive stroke at the age of 40.

81d0ffe3,Does CBD (Cannabidiol) help stroke victims recover? My mom has suffered from a stroke and has been very anxious at night. I am wondering if Cannabidiol might her calm down.,"CBD is actually excellent at treating anxiety. Marijuana can actually induce anxiety in some people, but CBD is non-psychoactive so you get all the natural healing properties without the high. The body’s endocannabinoid system
plays a big role in the regulation of stress by gating and constraining anxiety responses within the body. CBD also doesn’t come with the side effects that other anti-anxiety medications like Xanax or Valium have.

9ee554ce,Can a hyperbaric chamber help stroke patients recover faster than blood thinners?,"Typically blood thinners are not for stroke recovery…. On the other hand… read on.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been shown to help prevent and treat stroke through a number of different mechanisms. HBOT can be used to precondition the brain by producing more circulatory pathways to potentially decrease the chance of stroke.
Also, this has been shown to benefit post-stroke patients, as compromised blood flow to the affected area of the brain and its functionality are recoverable by introducing increased levels of oxygen. Studies have demonstrated the benefits of HBOT for stroke with the following:
Stroke Prevention
• Stimulates the Creation of New Blood Vessels
• Decreases Oxidative Stress in the Brain
• Supports the Promotion of Optimal Blood Flow
• Preconditions the Brain to Enable Neuroprotective Properties
Stroke Recovery
• Supports Overall Recovery
• Reduces Paralysis
• Increases Brain Tissue Recovery
• Promotes the Creation of New Brain Cells
• Alleviates Spasticity
• Improves Vision and Speech
• Accelerates Gross/Fine Motor Skills Recovery
• Stimulates the Creation of Blood Vessels to Reclaim Damaged Brain Tissue
• Augments the Creation of New Brain Connections
The most important criteria being, for stroke survivors, Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy reactivates the idling neurons, stimulates growth of new blood vessels, prevents cell death, and improves neurological function."
377625e5,"Can a person have both kinds of strokes, hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes within 30 days, and can he recover?",It is unfortunately quite possible. It is usually the result of therapeutics going a little too far with the result that a clot is over-treated and now becomes the blood “becoming too thin” or that the thinned blood is treated to a point where clots form. A patient that has both kind of strokes can recover but his/ her chances of permanent problems are unfortunately not that great.
d66e789b,What medical help can rich people get to help them recover from a stroke?,"Basically physical therapy where you make the patient use the affected limbs while not allowing them to use the good ones.
But really an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure; going on the MIND diet, losing weight, exercising including cardio ( i run 20 miles and walk 20 miles a week) and weight training and using medication to control any risk factors is a better way to go than dealing with a stroke."
1e8f86aa,"Yesterday my grandma had a stroke, she hadn’t received help for 12 hours and is now paralyzed on the entire left side of her body. Does anybody know the odds of her recovering or ways to improve her recovery?","They used to say if a person comes to the hospital within 3 hours of a stroke ,Brain damage can be prevented.But the new study suggests that the traditional three-hour time window is too short. By combining data from multiple clinical trials, Maarten Lansberg, MD, PhD, assistant professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford, and colleagues from Belgium and Germany showed that treatment can benefit patients up to 4.5 hours after they experience their first symptom. Their findings were published online May 21 in the journal Stroke.
Every year, more than 750,000 Americans experience a stroke, or brain attack, due to a sudden drop in blood flow to the brain. Most strokes are ischemic, meaning they're caused by a blocked artery. For these strokes, a medication called tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA, can open blocked blood vessels and help restore blood flow to the brain.
Ideally one should go to a hospital where they can go through the groin vein and remove the blood clot in the brain.
Signs of stroke
Face: Smile and see if one side of the face droops.
Arms: Raise both arms. Does one arm drop down?
Speech: Say a short phrase and check for slurred or strange speech.
Time: If the answer to any of these is yes, call 911 right away and write down the time when symptoms started.
Warning Signs
Sometimes a stroke happens gradually, but you’re likely to have one or more sudden symptoms like these:
Numbness or weakness in your face, arm, or leg, especially on one side
Confusion or trouble understanding other people
Difficulty speaking
Trouble seeing with one or both eyes
Problems walking or staying balanced or coordinated
Dizziness
A severe headache that comes on for no reason
If you have these symptoms, call 911 even if you’re not sure you’re having a stroke.
3 Types of Strokes
Ischemic Strokes (Clots)
Ischemic strokes
occur as a result of an obstruction within a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain. The underlying condition for this type of obstruction is the development of fatty deposits lining the vessel walls. This condition is called atherosclerosis. These fatty deposits can cause two types of obstruction:
Cerebral thrombosis refers to a thrombus (blood clot) that develops at the clogged part of the vessel.
Cerebral embolism refers generally to a blood clot that forms at another location in the circulatory system, usually the heart and large arteries of the upper chest and neck. A portion of the blood clot breaks loose enters the bloodstream and travels through the brain’s blood vessels until it reaches vessels too small to let it pass. A second important cause of embolism is an irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation. It creates conditions where clots can form in the heart, dislodge and travel to the brain.
Hemorrhagic Strokes (Bleeds)
Hemorrhagic
stroke
accounts for about 13 percent of stroke cases. It results from a weakened vessel that ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain. The blood accumulates and compresses the surrounding brain tissue. The two types of hemorrhagic strokes are intracerebral (within the brain) hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a weakened blood vessel ruptures. Two types of weakened blood vessels usually cause hemorrhagic stroke. An aneurysm is a ballooning of a weakened region of a blood vessel. If left untreated, the aneurysm continues to weaken until it ruptures and bleeds into the brain. An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a cluster of abnormally formed blood vessels. Any one of these vessels can rupture, also causing bleeding into the brain.
Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)
TIAs are often labeled mini-strokes
because they can be relatively benign in terms of immediate consequences. But the term “warning stroke” is more appropriate for these temporary episodes, because they can indicate the likelihood of a coming stroke. A TIA is a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. The blockage is short-term or temporary during a TIA or warning stroke. The clot may dissolve on it its own or get dislodged so that it stops causing the symptoms. Temporary symptoms may occur. A third of U.S. adults have had symptoms consistent with a TIA. The symptoms are similar to an ischemic stroke, but TIA symptoms usually last less than five minutes with an average of about a minute. When a TIA is over, that particular blockage usually causes no permanent injury to the brain.

cff9b633,"Can movement, feeling etc be recovered a years or longer after a stroke?","So I had a hemorrhagic stroke after an arterial dissection 10 years ago. Part of the ongoing issue that I’ve been having involves temperature…my left side no longer interprets temperature correctly, if something is too hot or too cold, it just hurts. So this made swimming impossible…I’d put a foot in, it would just hurt, I’d pull it out. Even in the shower, I still have to put my right side in first, then slowly bring the left in.
Anyway, two years ago my wife and I went on a cruise to Bermuda. I tried going in a swimming pool in preparation, and had absolutely no pain. It was amazing! I stayed in for an hour, not wanting to break the spell, I really misses swimming. On the boat, I tried a hot tub, again, no problems. Finally, I attempted to swim in the ocean in Bermuda, and was absolutely fine.
So I did recover something. I tried every year to go swimming, and was never able to do so, but finally something healed enough to allow me to do it again. It can be done! They say something like 95% of the healing takes place in the first year, but the brain works in mysterious ways, always looking for opportunities to heal."

As soon as he or she can swallow safely, I would start with nourishing vegetable soups. You can puree them if chewing is an issue. Use a variety of vegetables. Simmer them in a base of homemade chicken bone stock. Don’t add salt. Use fresh garlic, onions, leeks and spices to amp up the flavor, then add fresh herbs and a squeeze of fresh lemon to each serving. Herbs have many healing properties and acid enhances flavors.
I eat lots of wild-caught fish, especially Alaskan Salmon and black cod. They are both low in mercury and high in Omega-3 fatty acids — and they are delicious! Sardines and herring are other good choices.
I get a box of in-season veggies delivered weekly from a nearby farm. Now, it contains a lot of greens and winter squash. Both are highly nutritious, but I supplement with things that catch my eye in the market. Tokyo turnips, for instance. Both the greens and the white bulbs are very nutritious and not nearly as strong as the purple top turnips.
Check with his/her doctor for and deficiencies and discuss how to address them.
I was off-the-charts low in Vitamin D. In the hospital, they also gave me Potassium for a few days and Magnesium for a few days. To fix it, I supplemented with a lot of Vitamin D for six weeks until my levels returned to the normal range, and I eat foods rich in Potassium and Magnesium every day.
Don’t fall for the scam-of-the-week supplements. Simply eat well, take meds as directed and exercise as much as he or she is able. Slow and steady wins the race."
17345e37,How does music help stroke patients recover?,"From https://www.neurologytimes.com/stroke/music-stroke-recovery
Mechanisms of stroke recovery with music therapy
As with most rehabilitative techniques, challenging and using the injured brain can improve abilities. Exactly how and why this happens on a cellular level remains unclear. There are several leading theories regarding the mechanism by which music therapy improves patient abilities in stroke recovery.
Music plays a large role in mood for many people. Musical pieces can elicit pleasant or unpleasant emotions that are rooted in life memories. The response of mood to music may be conscious or subconscious. Music that evokes memories of pleasant interpersonal connections or achievements may elevate the mood of some stroke survivors. Positive mood has been shown to play a significant role in stroke recovery.
Additionally, rehabilitative techniques are believed to augment neuroplasticity. Yet why some methods seem to have this effect is not clear. And, yet another theory is that enhanced connectivity between regions of the brain can allow stroke survivors to regain skills that were lost. There are some overlaps between this idea and that of theories surrounding neuroplasticity, but there are also some aspects of the two concepts that are independent.
Thus far, research on music therapy in stroke recovery is favorable. Given the relatively low cost of music therapy and the lack of treatment for brain injury incurred by stroke, it is an interesting option for recovering stroke patients."
3c3d9deb,Have you had a stroke? Did you manage to recover?,"Well I guess I did. I was in the hospital for something else, so the Dr wanted a cat scan.

So he referred me to a neurologist. The neurologist wanted to send me for more tests. One ofthemisa MRI. Well that didn't go well cuz I am extremely costraphobic. So I never took that test. I also never went back to see him. He was very rude to me and a complete butt hole! I haven't had any symptoms and it's been over a year.

5332804d,Can a person recover when the largest part of the brain is affected by a stroke?,"Our brain is incredibly resilient to diseases like strokes given proper time and care.
The brain has got a property of plasticity. This means that in case the brain has sustained an injury like a stroke, there is functional re-organization of circuits in brain that can take place. Here, the parts adjacent to damaged areas starts reorganizing themselves and take over the functions of the damaged area. This again is dependent on the quality of rehabilitation initiated after stroke. The rehabilitation helps the brain to learn how to perform a function that was lost due to stroke like lifting up an arm or to speak. Thus the rehabilitative strategies like physiotherapy and speech therapy adopted helps the brain to regain it's lost function and recover from stroke to a large extend.
However, if a large part of brain is affected, the chance of recovery comes down because the normal areas that must learn the functions of the damaged parts are meager.
Recovery from a major stroke that has involved a large area of brain then depends upon factors like age of the patient, stroke severity, the quantum of neurologic deficits, the level of sensorium, co-morbidities, intercurrent complications like aspiration pneumonia and urinary infection, development of bed sores, the extend to which nursing care and rehabilitative measures are provided etc...
As already mentioned in the outset, our brain is quite neuro-plastic & resilient and recovery after a stroke even if large area of brain is affected it not beyond reach."

A good neuro-rehab team can assess the damage and put together a plan of action. Warehousing stroke survivors in nursing homes almost guarantees that they will be invalids for the rest of their lives."

415a9d30,What is the probability of a 40+ year old woman surviving and recovering a stroke? She’s in an induced coma with minimal brain activity.,"Many years ago, the course of strokes was less predictable because they did not have as good of imaging techniques as we have today. Today, when the doctors see a devastating stroke, they are upfront with the family because they do not want to present them with false hope.
These statements are all true:
· People in a vegetative state due to stroke, loss of oxygen to the brain (anoxia) or some types of severe medical illness may not recover as well as those with traumatic brain injury.
· By reducing the activity in the brain and slowing its metabolism, an induced coma can help protect the neural (nerve tissue) by reducing the work of brain cells.
· The slowing of brain function is necessary to prevent damage that can be done by a lack of blood flow.
· When patients are in a medically induced coma, the brain is quiet for up to several seconds at a time, punctuated by short bursts of activity. This pattern, known as burst suppression, allows the brain to conserve vital energy during times of trauma.
· Stroke severity and patient age are the two most important factors in predicting one’s chances of survival after a stroke.
""A wide variety of factors influence stroke prognosis, including age, stroke severity, stroke mechanism, infarct location, comorbid conditions, clinical findings, and related complications. In addition, interventions such as thrombolysis, stroke unit care, and rehabilitation can play a major role in the outcome of ischemic stroke.""
(see article, Ischemic stroke prognosis in adults by Matthew A Edwardson, MD
).
So, let's take this one, one at a time. At age 40, she is younger than most, and that can be good. You do not say if this was a minimal or a massive stroke but I am assuming since they put her into a medically induced coma, it was pretty significant, so that is bad. Stroke outcomes are better if the person gets diagnosed quickly and get medication in them known as clot busters.
There are two types of stroke; one where a blood clot lodges and blocks off blood flow, which is called an ischemic stroke, and one where they had a bleed, called a hemorrhagic stroke. You did not mention which type it was, but as you will see from the next statement, stroke statistics are pretty grim.
""Of the surviving patients, 60 percent who suffered an ischemic stroke and 38 percent with intracerebral hemorrhage survived one year, compared to 31 percent and 24 percent, respectively, after five years. At the end of the [five year] study, 29 percent of the stroke patients were still alive.""
(see article, Stroke Survival Statistics: 9 Sobering Facts We Should All Be Aware Of, Saebo,
Monday, June 11th, 2018).
The brain is complex and tricky. In all of the areas of medicine I worked in, neuro-trauma was both the most devastating AND the most miraculous. It also seems to be an area where doctors still say, ""We just don't know"" more than any other area.
My advice to you, if you are visiting with her, is to touch her gently and talk to her quietly if the medical staff approves. Take things one day at a time. Pray, and hope for the best, but . . ., prepare for the worst."

Some people have small strokes- called a TIA- my understanding is a TIA is a tiny blood clot that partially blocked a vein somewhere , then passed on through. TIA’s have no lasting effect on a person. TIA is transeschemic attack. Probably spelled that wrong- I’m lazy right now.
Other patients have blood clots that paralyze them temporarily until we bust up the clot. Then slowly the paralysis goes away & function returns over time.
The bigger the blood clot the bigger physical effects, of the clot goes to the brain, the lungs- not good.
Younger people rehabilitate faster than old folks."
276a1dc4,I’m 43 and I was a stroke when I was 36. My half body can move slowly and can walk. How long can I recover my left arm and leg back to normal?,"Part of your brain was irreversibly damaged by the stroke but there is a lot of brain left and even the adult brain exhibits “plasticity” meaning it can, to an extent, reconfigure itself to allow other parts to take over the function of the damaged region. This is like the process of learning and depends on repeated attempts to undertake tasks, plus encouragement with positive feedback, over a period of years. It’s never too late to make progress but it’s impossible to predict how much function can be restored."
9667bd95,Has anyone ever recovered their vision after an eye stroke (retinal vein occlusion)?,"Yes…to varying degrees. Much more so than a Retinal Artery Occlusion. Here’s an analogy I use: if you were growing crops in a desert, and you cut off the water supply, the plants would die, and be dead. That’s an RAO. If you flooded the plants, for way too long, some of them would die, some would come back but not thrive, and some would grow back just fine. That’s more like an RVO.
The retina just gets clogged up with too much, “stuff”, and has to dry it all out. So, really, it ends up being how long it was flooded, if and when it was treated, or how long has it been in the process of “drying up”. A bunch of unknowns, but, I’ve seen patients come back pretty well, even after a year.
Then the question remains, how are you treating the underlying cause of it?"
06d02db7,Can someone recover from a stroke if their voice has been changed since then?,"Partial recovery is very usual, but total recovery less so.
Patients with strokes should never abandon hope of continuing, if limited, recovery. They should not, however, be unrealistic in their expectations and go on 'hoping against hope', because most of their recovery occurs relatively early. However, there are always exceptions."

Did you imply that you were giving it to her. Or did you give it to her and now you changed your mind. It's important but your relationship with your daughter is more important.
Your next decision is very important. What is more important to you. Or is this just a simple discussion, over a meal, thanking her for taking care of the ring."
ab12ba41,How admissible are statements made by a heavily sedated hospital patient recovering from a massive stroke?,"According to Indian law at least, if the statement was a dying declaration or deposition, it would hold immense ground, irrespective of whether sedatives had been administered to the patient or not, more so if it was the latter. In all other cases, the defendant could easily question the mental capacity of the patient at the time of the statement, the dilemma being resolved by a certificate given by an attending medical officer testifying whether the patient was mentally fit to give any statement at the given time. Generally, such a certificate is a mandatory requirement before recording a statement."

4f137ff2,What are the methods to recover lost muscle function in paralysis (hemiplegia) caused by ishemic stroke?,"What are the methods to recover lost muscle function in paralysis caused by ischemic stroke?
I had an ischemic stroke almost 3 years ago now. I,too, suffered from hemiplegia, on the left side. I don’t consider myself fully recovered yet, since I still can’t run properly, and still have some weakness in my left foot. But otherwise, everyone tells me there is no noticeable indication I ever had a stroke nor was hemiplegic, so I guess as far as ordinary daily living goes, I’verecovered.
Methods? Essentially, physical therapy: exercises and electric stimulation. The therapist used this little device the name of which escapes me now, sorry. The device essentially sent electric current to stimulate the muscles during a particular task. So, for example, it was attached to my bicep, and while I was trying to lift my arm, the device helped with the muscle contraction. Same with tricep exercises, and foot exercises. It took a little bit of knowledge of anatomy to knowwhere to attach the device though. Then lots of exercise and practice. Then I just progressed to more difficult tasks.
BUt the whole thing wasn’t easy. It required concentration, focus, and lots and lots of patience. I was doing PT almost everyday, an hour a day. I think it took me about a year before I had the confidence to try getting around by myself, like going back to school for my PhD, driving the car, swimming by myself without any safety device like floaters, and riding my bike.
So I hope I answered your question . TLDR: electric stimulation and exercise. Best of luck to you or the person you’re asking for."
1bd6029b,Once you format and reinstall Windows to your computer. Can you still recover the words that were typed on that computer? Can we still recover the keyboard strokes?,"If the keystrokes were written to a file then it may be possible to recover depending on when the file was deleted. If it was deleted long ago then , the sectors might have got overwritten and recovery may not be possible. Else you can use recovery softwares like RecoverMyFiles to get back the file.
Usually on Reinstlalling Windows, the HDD gets wiped properly because there happens a formatting phase before installing happens.
So, i would suggest to give it a try."

4771682e,"I read somewhere that video games could help someone recover from a stroke. If this is true, which games were they?","Reading this question, I have begun to feel the skepticism slowly arising inside of me. But, as it turns out, that thing is very much real. There are even TED talks about that stuff, wow. It caught me by surprise, no less.
As more effort and research are being devoted to video games and virtual reality for stroke recovery treatment, there may be a new solution on the horizon. Ideally, therapy is repetitive, task-specific, challenging, and exciting—video games address these needs and more through one of the brain’s natural processes called neuroplasticity, where nerve cell connections are recreated and remodeled. The brain strengthens neural networks through tasks that are repeated and habitual. These actions are naturally easier to perform due to neural pathways being well traveled. Doing or thinking about something new or in a different manner allows the brain to create new pathways or awaken old ones. Activities designed in video games help patients do just that.

e52a83bc,"What are your thoughts on the comment that ""COVID 19 is the worst disease. When they say 'recovered' they don’t tell you that it means you may need a lung transplant or you may get a massive heart attack or stroke""?",
4c73d572,What does it mean when you’ve had a heart attack and stroke at same time left side of your brain continues to swell. Then are put on a ventilator because your not breathing o own? Can you recover from this?,"So, when you have a heart attack, something happens that causes the supply of blood, which carries all the goodies like oxygen, Ions and other nutrients to the muscle tissue of the heart to be cut off enough to cause it to stop beating. When your heart stops beating this means no other parts of your body can get those same goodies in the blood that they need to do their jobs. if the other parts of your body don’t do their jobs, things start breaking down in the body that ultimately can lead to someone passing.
When you have a stroke, on a very basic level it’s the same thing, part of your brain has been deprived of all the nutrients it needs to do its job, which is causing the other parts of the body to function properly. While not always the case, strokes are often caused by a blood vessel in the brain breaking and leaking blood away from the tissues of the brain. The swelling of the brain in this case seems to be due to the blood from a burst vessel pooling in the skull and not flowing where it normally should. If the swelling continues it can put more pressure on the brain and injure it further, so if the blood or possibly fluid can’t be diverted through other means, they might have to perform surgery or insert some device to take the fluid out and take pressure off the brain.
one of the major functions of the brain is to help regulate your breathing. If your brain has been injured by pressure from pooling blood or fluid or from being deprived of the nutrients it needs in the blood, then it will have trouble controlling the patients breathing well enough to keep them alive so they might have to be attached to a ventilator so that the machine can do the breathing for the patient.
Lots of people do recover from heart attacks and from strokes. The only thing to keep in mind is that brain tissue and heart tissue in general don’t heal quite as well as things like your skin, so while the patient might be able to come off the ventilator, their mind might not be the same or they might have movement or speech or other difficulties depending on what part of the brain was injured. Likewise with the heart while some of the damage from the heart attack might heal, there’s no guarantee it will all heal, and it’s likely that even if the patient is well enough to leave the hospital they might not have the same capacity for activity that requires their heart to work harder like it once did."

Yet, there is no good predictor of who will recover and not, depending on numerous factors including sex, age, ethnicity, co-morbidity factors……
As a very big rule of thumb, we estimate that the brain recovery will likely take place within six months, after that period the chance of recovery is close to zero.
Thus, there is a big emphasis on research to try to maximize on the brain repair and understand which mechanisms are associated with improved recovery."

9879e081,"Can your mental ability or cognitive abilities change after a stroke, and if so, can they be recovered?","Yes, unfortunately those funtions can be damaged depending on the location and severity of the blood vessel blockage, bleeding or rupture. Recovery also depends on the extent of damage occurring. Thus, recovery of function may be total, partial, or ruled out completely.
BUT, ‘brain plasticity’ allows not only for levels of possible recovery at the damaged site — it also allows for adjacent brain areas (which are undamaged) to gradually take over the lost functions. New neural pathways can be forged, or sometimes redundant brain regions assume a greater role. Still, this may entail an arduous process of rehabilitation, but it is within possibility. Only the attending neurologist can predict an approximation on chances for recovery."
26319180,My husband had a stroke in 2019. He has recovered but can no longer move his right arm and walks by dragging his right leg.

If he was given ADA accommodations and in 2021 was using the stroke from 2019 as an excuse to be less productive he failed. If he chooses to be fired and appeal the decision, the labour board or DWD will provide a written determination which will show who was at fault.

If the President has a stroke, or any health issue, that incapacitates him, he can be removed from office per the 25th amendment. It would depend on how severely he was impacted, however. Keep in mind that FDR was a cripple due to polio during his time in office, and JFK was addicted to drugs (methamphetamine).
The only President that comes to my mind that was unable to serve due to an illness (a severe stroke) was Woodrow Wilson. His wife, Edith, was the de facto head of the Executive branch for about a year and a half as a result. She technically doesn't qualify, but she was in a practical sense the first woman President.
Edith Wilson - Wikipedia
If the President has to ""take time to recover"" from some issue, it may be enough to have him removed him from office. A short break, like when Reagan was shot, probably wouldn't be enough as the VP would step in for the duration. But after a certain point (politically determined, of course), it could trigger removal."

4eac1979,What can I do to help a gerbil to recover after having a stroke?,"Make sure he can reach food and water, is somewhere at least somewhat sheltered, and is going to the bathroom.
Tiny animals, especially ones which are naturally prey for other animals, may find being unable to hide desperately stressful and this stress is not easy for human eyes to see. For that reason, unless your gerbil is already mobile, or showing fairly fast improvement, it may be that euthanasia is the only way to make sure that he or she does not suffer undue distress.
Unfortunately, other gerbils may have a… not helpful reaction to their debilitated cagemate, so if he currently is not mobile you are likely to need to care for him in a separate cage for now.
Check in with your vet, and remember that being a good custodian of tiny lives may include really tough decisions. I’m very sorry. Good luck."
6687fccb,What are blood clots?,"A blood clot is a build-up of blood that has changed from a liquid state to a gelatinous or semi-solid state. Clotting is a necessary process that can prevent you from losing too much blood in certain cases, such as when you are injured or cut. When a clot forms internally in one of your veins, it may not usually dissolve on its own. This may be a completely risky and even life-threatening situation.
Types of blood clots:
Arterial clots form in the arteries. Once arterial clots form, they cause signs right away. Because this type of clot prevents oxygen from reaching vital organs, it can cause severe pain and serious health emergencies, such as stroke, heart attack, severe abdominal pain, and paralysis.
Venous clots usually form slowly in the veins. Venous clot signs, including swelling, redness, numbness, and pain, are gradually noticed.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the name given when a clot forms in one of the main veins inside your body. It is most common for this to occur in one of your legs, however, it may additionally take place in your arms, pelvis, lungs, or maybe your brain.
Superficial vein thrombosis is a blood clot that forms in a vein near the surface of the skin. They are not normally released or travel through the bloodstream.

f05cc740,What does a blood clot in one's leg feel like?,
2371ae15,Can blood clots be treated?,"A2A
Yes they can, and there are a few different ways to go about it.
There are clot busting medications that can eliminate an already-existing clot. For example, in people who are having ischemic strokes (caused by clots), we use a medication called TPA that is literally able to destroy the clot.
You can also use medications like Heparin or Coumadin (Warfarin). For people who are in the hospital for clots, we frequently will use a heparin infusion to treat the clots as well as prevent new ones from forming. Coumadin is more a medication people are sent home on.
There are newer medications that I'm not a huge fan of, including things like Eliquis, Xeralto, and Pradaxa and their claim to fame in advertising is that they don't require blood testing. What they don't tell you is that the reason that you don't have to have blood testing is because they don't actually know what clotting factor it mediates and therefore they actually don't know how to test for it. Moreover, that means that they don't have medications to reverse these blood thinners in the event they're too effective at thinning your blood. That can be pretty catastrophic.
Sometimes you can actually handle clots surgically as well. Think of a cardiac catheterization, for example. They take a catheter, usually through your groin, and they threat it up to your heart and into the coronary arteries to grab the clot leading to a heart attack to stop the damage. There are also embolectomies (surgical removal of a clot that has traveled, aka ""embolus"") and thrombectomies (surgical removal of a clot). It's pretty darn cool!"
6f805886,How does blood clot?,"Turns out blood is a pretty interesting substance. As most of us know, it provides nutrients at the cellular level and carries away the resultant waste. In addition, white blood cells and various proteins mediate a highly complex immune response to hoards of invaders that would kill us without that response. As to coagulation, it begins with platelet exposure to a disrupted vessel wall lining that results in a cascade of protein transformations resulting in the formation of fibrin, the gelatinous substance that we know as clot. The interesting thing is that blood HAS to remain a fluid under most circumstances and HAS to generate semi solid clot when the vascular system is disrupted. Without this delicate, dynamic balance of fluid vs solid, we would bleed out at minor injury, or undergo random disruption of the circulation that is so necessary for survival. That this happens most of the time is one of the true wonders of human physiology. However, there are clotting disorders, such as hemophilia and various protein abnormalities that can result abnormalities that disrupt this delicate balance. Disclaimer: I am not a biochemist, so some of the details here may be faulty but I was trained by an academic vascular surgeon who’s primary research interest was in this area."
91dabbe4,Why are so many COVID-19 patients also seeing blood clots?,"It's a trend that has been noticed recently that increasing number of blood clots in severe cases of covid 19.
REASON. possible reasons would be :-
1)the virus would increase the general inflammatory reaction in the whole body not just the lungs leading to increased number of circulating inflammatory markers such as D-dimer which acts on fibrinogen activity.
2) the virus might attach to small capillaries that is the microvasculature and cause endothelial injury resulting in clot formation that is numerous number of small clots throughout the entire body
Risk - risk would be clot dislodgement and causing deadly pulmonary embolism is the widely noticed trend now and the clots could also damage the vasculature of other organs like kidneys etc
Treatment modality - it would be to put all the patients under anti coagulant therapy when they cross certain phases of treatment or when having high levels of D-dimer level if not contraindicated otherwise"
9a20b0eb,How does blood clots dissolve naturally?,"Your body is supposed to do it for you. Coagulation begins usually with platelets get ‘sticky’, form a ‘white clot’, then the clotting components get activated and they form a sticky ‘blob’ including red cells. That results in a red plug.
The conditions that trigger clotting don’t normally exists inside of blood vessels. When they do, clots inside the blood vessels cause problems. A cause for that is often a chemical reaction and a known one is sometimes an antigen-antibody interaction. That isn’t supposed to happen, but in some situations (like an allergy to heparin) it does.
To answer your question, the body has an antidote for clots. Chemicals will break down the clots. There is a blood test that shows when this is happening. (d-dimer). In Covid-19 with intravascular clotting, that is positive, so the problem is not that the clot prevention isn’t working, but something is triggering the clotting inside the blood vessels.
The most common problem in humans is Leiden factor V, a mutation. I cannot find any reports relating this to coronavirus, but there is one that evaluates the same clotting problem in H1N1 flu, and Leiden factor V was not involved.
Leiden factor V patients often don’t need treatment since it is usually a problem for young females on birth control pills (estrogen makes it worse).
Excessive clotting can be treated with hepain, hirudin analogs, and long term by coumadin or factor X inhibitors like abcixamab.
I hope this helps."
c8ea0fe0,Which vitamin is necessary for blood clotting?,"“ Vitamin K plays an important role in coagulation, better known as blood clotting. Clotting is a process that helps prevent excessive bleeding both inside and outside the body. Your body needs vitamin K in order to produce the proteins that go to work during the clotting process.
Vitamin K. Vitamin K is a cofactor for the enzyme responsible for chemical reactions that maintain blood clotting factors: prothrombin; Factors VII, IX, and X; and proteins C and S. Because vitamin K is supplied in the diet and by synthesis of intestinal bacteria, deficiencies are not common.
Vitamin K is found in some plant foods, such as leafy green vegetables, and is also produced by the body. Vitamin K comes in two forms. ... Both vitamin K-1 and vitamin K-2 produce proteins that help the blood to clot.

212767ee,Are the reports of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine causing fatal blood clots real? What should people that have already taken the vaccine do now?,"The AstraZeneca vaccine appears to cause a very specific type of blood clot in the brain, Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST), in a very small percent of patients under 60. It is an extremely rare condition. It is still extremely rare among those who have taken the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine, but the (very small) numbers are large enough relative to the normal rates that the regulatory bodies are acknowledging a likely connection. Those who experience it usually get symptoms between days 4–20 post-vaccination, so if you have taken AZ and are past that window, no need to worry. For more detail, please see the Canadian article I included later in this post.
Different countries are making different decisions about how to react to this. The risk of this side effect is much lower than the risk from COVID-19. We accept medical treatments all the time which carry some degree of risk, because the prognosis is still better than no treatment at all. In this case, the situation is complicated because (a) the group at highest risk for the CVST side effect (people under 60) is at lower risk from COVID-19; (b) not everyone will catch COVID-19, and (c) there are other vaccines which don’t seem to cause this side effect - but these are in short supply. If a country has the option to vaccinate with AZ or suffer a COVID-19 outbreak with no vaccine, it’s better to use AZ. But where multiple vaccines are available, it makes sense to use AZ for older people and a different choice for younger people.
The reporting on this topic has been particularly confusing. The UK and EU were already feuding about vaccine access, and then the EU started having these cases, and the UK initially denied any link. There are innocent reasons for them to have done so. The UK began its vaccination program with senior citizens, only vaccinating a small number of younger patients, eg healthcare workers. This very rare side effect was not noticeable because most of the people they were vaccinating were low risk for the CVST side effect. However, some EU countries, such as Germany, began with vaccinating people under 65. (AZ hadn’t tested many seniors in their trials, and Germany was waiting for UK data to be convinced the vaccine was safe for older citizens.) Ironically, that meant they vaccinated younger people first, who turn out to be at higher risk for the CVST side effect. That’s why they noticed it so quickly, and explains why the UK and EU data seemed to contradict each other at first. However, as the UK finished vaccinating its seniors and moved on to its younger residents, they began having cases, too. Also, the numbers in the EU got larger as they vaccinated more people, and it became clearer it’s not just a statistical fluke.
Here is what the UK is saying now (as of Apr 7). The UK is recommending that people under 30 who are receiving their first dose take Pfizer or Moderna instead, and is continuing to use AZ for people older than 30.
There have been reports of an extremely rare adverse event of concurrent thrombosis (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) following vaccination with the first dose of AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222). There has been no signal for thrombosis/thrombocytopenia following receipt of other COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the UK (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). Given the very low numbers of events reported overall, there is currently a high level of uncertainty in estimates of the incidence of this extremely rare adverse event by age group. However, the available data do suggest there may be a trend for increasing incidence of this adverse event with decreasing age, with a slightly higher incidence reported in the younger adult age groups.
JCVI statement on use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine: 7 April 2021
Since the start of the pandemic over 4 million COVID-19 infections have been confirmed in the UK causing more than 120,000 deaths. Over 30 million people have received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine since the start of the programme, which Public Health England ( PHE ) estimate has prevented at least 6,000 deaths in the first 3 months of 2021. Analysis of infection data since the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccines in the UK demonstrates that vaccination is highly effective and substantially reduces the risk of infection and severe COVID-19 disease. There have been reports of an extremely rare adverse event of concurrent thrombosis (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) following vaccination with the first dose of AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222). There has been no signal for thrombosis/thrombocytopenia following receipt of other COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the UK (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). Given the very low numbers of events reported overall, there is currently a high level of uncertainty in estimates of the incidence of this extremely rare adverse event by age group. However, the available data do suggest there may be a trend for increasing incidence of this adverse event with decreasing age, with a slightly higher incidence reported in the younger adult age groups. In contrast, the risks of severe disease associated with COVID-19 increases steeply with age, with the youngest adults at lowest risk. There are currently no known risk factors for this extremely rare condition, which appears to be an idiosyncratic reaction on first exposure to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Alternatives to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine currently approved for use in the UK include the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines. JCVI has weighed the relative balance of benefits and risks and advise that the benefits of prompt vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine far outweigh the risk of adverse events for individuals 30 years of age and over and those who have underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease. JCVI currently advises that it is preferable for adults aged <30 years without underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease, to be offered an alternative COVID-19 vaccine, if available. People may make an informed choice to receive the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to receive earlier protection. There are some adults <30 without underlying health conditions who are in phase 1, who were prioritised due to an increased risk of exposure and/or to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to vulnerable individuals. This includes health and social care workers, unpaid carers and household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals. Acting on a precautionary basis, if these persons are still unvaccinated, it is preferable for them to be offered an alternative COVID-19 vaccine, if available. JCVI is currently f

[Herald Interview] Given choice, AstraZeneca vaccine ‘might not be preferable’ for young people
If vaccines other than AstraZeneca’s are available for young people, South Korean health authorities may want to consider an alternative, said Dr. Jean-Louis Excler, a vaccinologist at the International Vaccine Institute, as more countries limit the use of the vaccine to older people over blood clot concerns.

bbc34d7f,Which medicines help in preventing a blood clot?,"Blood thinners, there are variety. Some a constant same mg dose pill form.
Others like warfain often need constant blood work to ensure your inr is proper number they want you at. With that your mg dose changes constantly.
Then there needle form like lovenox. A fun needle taken in the hip, thigh, or stomach. For me, when I had to take it the stomach one burned.
You don't want have to take blood thinners, especially warfain. Food, what you drink can mess up you inr and are recommended not to take. There is also side effects that can happenen when your on them. For me warfain, made my hair fall out dramatically. Unfortunately with side effect like that sometimes doctors don't see it as a serious side effect and like blame others things for the reason like your diet. When was finally allowed end being on warfain a week later and no more hair falling out."
fa7b2540,What are some symptoms of blood clots?,"This question is too unspecific to be answered meaningfully.
Blood clots , where?
Clotting of blood can be a positive thing, such as in wound healing, when the blood clot forms to prevent loss of blood from an injured blood vessel, by sealing it. That process is called hemostasis.
It can also be positive in the case of the immune system physically trapping an invading microbe within small blood clots. You won’t feel anything if that happens.
It can be a negative thing when clotting happens in a heart vessel. If not resolved within a few minutes, the tissue downstream of the blood clot that occludes the vessel will die. That’s called a heart attack. If it resolves quick enough, again, you won’t notice anything.
When the same thing happens in the brain its called a stroke, or, if you are lucky, a TIA (transient ischemic attack).
Blood clots in the venous system are another problem to which Jennifer Larson has provided an answer."
f6991737,What does it mean when you have blood clots in your urine?,"Firstly, peeing blood can be a symptom of some serious diseases. Go to the doctor and report it. They should follow it up with a urine test, and probable blood tests. They will probably feel around for abdominal tenderness too.
If you are lucky, the cause will be less serious, such as infection in your urinary tract, kidneys, or perhaps stones in the bladder or kidney. You may have other symptoms, such as pain and urinary frequency/urgency that will help the doctor decide. Kidney stones are excruciatingly painful, so this problem may not seem so lucky!
It could be from kidney injury - sports, accident, falls - or even from a very stressful workout or intense running. This needs checking out.
Some medications, such as anticoagulants, may cause blood to appear in the urine - again, very important for a doctor to check this.
Probably the worst case scenario is what happened to me (though I didn't realise it immediately) - it's advanced kidney cancer. In my case, the few days where I had blood in my urine just happened to coincide with a bloody boil on my labia and I thought that's where the blood had come from. It wasn't till 3 months later when the doctor picked up high blood calcium levels in a routine blood test that the stage 4 cancer was detected. This can easily be fatal, I was given weeks not months until they decided the operation was feasible.
So, please get to a doctor tomorrow!"
8fa91e1d,What foods help with blood clotting?,"Blood clotting is a normal yet complex process which is known to prevent bleeding when there is an injury or a cut in our body. However, there are times when blood clots form in some critical parts of our body like heart, lung or brain, which if not treated in time, can cause serious complications. These clots may occur in the arterial or venous blood vessels. It is when this clot breaks and travels through the blood, it disrupts the flow of blood to important organs such as heart, lungs or brain, and can result in stroke.
Here are 5 natural
blood thinners to reduce blood clots and the risk of stroke:
1. Ginger
One of the best ways to add ginger to your diet is to begin your morning with tasty ginger tea. Research says that sipping ginger tea is quite beneficial and may cure many health problems. And, when it comes to blood thinning, ginger is known to reduce inflammation and further relaxes the muscles. Who knew that a single cup of ginger tea can do wonders for your health.
2. Cayenne Peppers
Cayenne peppers are power-packed with properties that help in thinning our blood. And, the credit goes to salicylates, which are found in high amount in cayenne peppers. Adding cayenne peppers to our daily diet, in the form of capsules or in the food, could lower your blood pressure and increase circulation.
3. Salmon
It is said that foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon, tuna and trout are one of the best blood thinning foods. It is mainly because omega-3 fatty acids help lower the cholesterol levels in our body. Moreover, they are known to reduce the chances of clotting in the blood.
4. Red Wine
Many experts and nutritionists believe that drinking a glass of red wine every day may help prevent heart diseases, as red wine is known to have properties that help in thinning the blood and further preventing clogged arteries. And, we know how much you fancy drinking red wine, so don't just get carried away and stick to only one glass a day!
5. Cinnamon
We add cinnamon to enhance the taste and fragrance of our dish or drink, especially when added to tea, it tastes bliss. But, did you know that it is a powerful anti-coagulant? Cinnamon is capable of lowering blood pressure and relieving inflammatory conditions. This may reduce the chances of having a stroke. However, long-term consumption of cinnamon may cause liver damage, therefore, make sure you use this spice sparingly.
Other than the natural foods and drinks mentioned above, there are other natural foods like pineapple, ginseng, kelp, olive oil, almonds and more that are known to reduce blood clotting. However, it's important to note that these foods need be taken in moderation. Always speak to your doctor before trying anything that could have an impact on your health"
8af3709a,Can you describe the process of blood clotting?,"Coagulation, in physiology, the process by which a blood
clot is formed. The first stage is primary homeostasis. It is characterized by blood
vessel
constriction and platelet
aggregation at the site of vessel injury.
Clotting is a sequential process that involves the interaction of numerous blood components called coagulation factors. There are 13 principal coagulation factors in all.
There are two processes that can initiate clotting:
A very rapid process the so-called extrinsic pathway .
Slower but larger intrinsic pathway .
Both pathways result in the production of factor X.
The Extrinsic Pathway -
Cells
that are normally found external to blood vessels secret a protein called Tissue factor, which starts the Extrinsic pathway.
Tissue factor binds to activated Factor 7.The TF-7 heterodimer
is a protease with two substrates: Factor 9 and Factor 10.
The Intrinsic Pathway-
The intrinsic
pathway is activated by injury that occurs within a blood vessel.
This pathway begins with the activation of factor XII (Hageman factor), which occurs when blood circulates over injured internal surfaces of vessels.
If blood escapes into tissue spaces
(e.g., as a result of an injury), contact with collagen in the tissue space activates Factor 12.
Activated Factor 12 is a serine protease
that activates Factor 11 which, in turn, activates Factor 9 which, in turn, activates Factor 10.
The Two Pathways Converge -
The activation of this factor marks the beginning of the so-called common pathway of coagulation Factor 10 — produced by either or, more likely, both pathways — binds and activates Factor 5.
This heterodimer is called prothrombinase because it is a protease that converts prothrombin (also known as Factor II) to thrombin.
Thrombin has several different activities.
Two of them are:proteolytic cleavage of fibrinogen (aka ""Factor I"") a soluble plasma
protein form long, sticky threads of insoluble fibrin
.
It activates Factor 13 which forms covalent bonds between the soluble fibrin molecules converting them into an insoluble mesh work that traps platelets, blood cells, and plasma Within minutes, the fibrin meshwork begins to contract, squeezing out its fluid contents.
This process, called clot retraction, is the final step in coagulation. It yields a resilient
, insoluble clot that can withstand the friction of blood flow."
3f7afe38,"When I'm on my period, I urinate blood clots. Why?","You’re probably not urinating the blood clots - they’re coming out of your vagina when you relax your muscles to pee. I strongly suggest you go to a gynecologist soon for an exam and a Pap smear, to rule out endometriosis or something else.
As with all body issues having to do with reproduction, it’s important to see a doctor right away, because these issues don’t usually get better by themselves. If you will ever want children, now is the time to make sure all your organs, particularly your ovaries, uterus, vagina, and endocrine system, are healthy and functioning correctly.
You’ll also save yourself anxiety and ‘what-if’ worries draining your peace of mind. You’ll be very glad you did."
09a6912d,What are the simple steps of blood clotting?,"The blood clotting process is very complex with many cascading steps. Some have broadly identified 3 processes. Vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and fibrin clot formation.
This must be what y0u are referring to."
23bfe49b,How do doctors diagnose blood clots?,"Doctors suspect clots by weighing risk factors like age, cancer, recent illness, and immobility as well as symptoms like swollen limbs or the sudden onset of trouble breathing or chest pain. Physical exam findings like one sided leg swelling or the LACK of other findings to explain trouble breathing raise the suspicion. Then tests are ordered: a d dimer blood test looks for evidence of recent clotting, and can exclude clots if the patient is low probability for having one. But often the test is an ultrasound of a limb or a CT scan of the chest looking for clots in the lung. Clots can also show up on nuclear medicine scans like a V/Q scan which shows patchy blood flow in lungs with clots in them (these tests are less precise than CT scans so they're rarely used, unless a person can't receive iodine based contrast for a CT or sometimes to plan certain lung surgeries). An MRI or clots can appear on a heart echo too. The odder the clot the more non standard the test to find it: Sagittarius sinus thrombosis of the brain is rare and would be detected mostly on MRI. Clots are also rare in the vena cava but a CT could see one.
The test of choice for blood clots, particularly of the lung, USED to be an angiogram, in which dye was injected directly into blood vessels near the suspected clot and x-rays taken. Because this is invasive and has been made unnecessary by CT scans, it's almost never done now.
Occasionally clots are not suspected but are found ""incidentally"" on scans done for other reasons. A common example is a cancer follow up scan which shows an asymptomatic clot; cancer patients are prone to clots and get a lot of scans."
51cbbd27,How do I resolve a blood clot?,"There are several types of drugs that will dissolve clots. The one that is used most urgently is heparin. It comes in a number od different molecular weights and can either prevent the fibrinogens from forming clots in the first place, or actually separate the molecules of the blood cells from each other. It is given as an injection or IV. There are other drugs that can do the same that can be given orally. I am currently receiving treatment for a DVT in my leg and am taking one or the oral drugs. I was hospitalized for two days with IV heparin when it was discovered, then released to home with the oral drug. It will take a total of 6 to 7 months to safely dissolve the clot without breaking it into small clots that could travel to my lungs or brain( a really, really bad idea)."
e8c03c80,What does blood contain that is necessary for blood clotting?,"Here’s a helpful diagram from Merck Manuals:
When an injury causes a blood vessel wall to break, platelets (in the blood) are activated. They start out as spherical-shaped, but change to spiny-shaped when activated so they can stick to the broken blood vessel wall and each other, starting to plug the wound. The platelets also interact with other proteins in the blood to form what is known as fibrin (made from thrombin), which functions almost as a net to entrap more platelets and blood cells to create the clot itself. As the blood vessel heals, the clot is slowly dissolved. Hope this helps!"
24c7deba,What are the risk factors for forming blood clots?,"‘Internal factors (those related to the person’s physical make-up) have 2 conditions that come to mind. The first is important: Leiden factor 5. This genetic condition makes the blood easier to form clots (thrombophilia). It’s presence is not readily apparent, but can be found on a blood test. It is a larger problem for females, as it is aggravated by estrogen. It often is first apparent after stating blood control pills. A rare condition is thrombocytosis; too many platelets in the blood.
External factors are mostly mechanical. Blood tends to clot when it is moving slowly. So sitting for long periods and especially if your legs are bent. Also after injury when leg is in cast, etc.
Arms aren’t prone to clotting. Blood clot in the lungs almost always start in upper leg or pelvic veins, and migrate."
88d151a1,Do blood clots have different names?,"Yes they do! A simple clot happens somewhere on or in the body. If the affect important areas, for instance a clot in one of the coronary arteries, it can, if large enough cause death because it causes the heart muscle to die. It the clot is large enough it will cause death. But a smaller clot would cause a coronary thrombosis (what caused it or the more modern term ‘myocardial infarction - meaning death of myocardial tissue.
An embolism is also a clot but this one can be moved so can affect different places in the body. The bigger the clot the moredamage occurs in the area where the embolism gets stuck, because it it too big to pass down narrowing arteries. This means the damage can occurs anywhere in the body. Common sites are limbs, for example in the leg, the area of the limb affected will depend on the size of the clot. This outcome would lead to to gangrene and may require ampution. If a clot moves to the brain then the result would be a cebro-vascular accident or more commonly called a stroke. The clot has caused the area supplied by the blocked artery to die. The affects of such an eccentric could be mild or fatal. But often the person suffers loss of mobility on one side, partial blindness, loss of speech, loss of understanding, - the result depends on what part of the brain is affected.
An embolism, depending on it size, could cause a minor problem, or severe disability, or losing the ability to speak and be understood. But it can also be immediately fatal.
The affects of the disability a thrombosis can cause can, and often are life changing. For the individual affected but also partners, extended family and friends."

0bb4fa82,Which conditions increase the likelihood of blood clots?,"There are both conditions and situations that increase a person’s liklihood of developing a blood clot.
Conditions
Thick blood. Blood that is thicker than normal due to conditions like polycythemia Vera, or dehydration.
Injury
Some injuries are known for blood clot formation, such as a broken femur (upper thigh bone). This makes sense, because when a blood vessel is damaged, it tries to stop the bleeding by clotting and sometimes that clot breaks loose and travels.
Medications
Certain medications are known for blood clot problems. If the patient is on birth control pills, they are stopped immediately. Testosterone supplements can also thicken blood.
Conditions
Inactivity
Good circulation depends on good movement. Every year, people who never had a blood clot before wind up with one from riding in an airplane with their legs down and moving very little. Patients hospitalized and suddenly inactive, even patients who go to surgery are at risk of blood clots.
High levels of cholesterol and tricylerides (fats) can build up plaque inside blood vessels, making them more narrow inside, less slippery and less elastic and therefore more prone to the development of a blood clot.
This time of year, we see the snow shovelers’ heart attack. This is generally a person with high cholesterol and high tricycle levels, often out of shape who goes out in the cold to shovel which causes the body to use a lot of energy both to stay warm AND to move all that snow. A blood clot breaks loose from inside one of those not-so-smooth-inside blood vessels, travels to the tiny coronary vessels feeding the ever active heart muscle and WHAM, they have a heart attack."
f869c170,Why would a vaccine cause blood clots?,"Your question suggests that ALL vaccines cause blood clotting. That is definitely not true. You might MEAN to ask why one vaccine, the Astra Zeneca Covid vaccine causes blood clots. Currently, it is still an open question whether it does, or if the clots are a result of ascertainment bias and correlation.
But let’s say there is a relationship between this ONE vaccine and an extremely rare side effect of an unusual clotting disorder coupled with thrombocytopenia. What might be the explanation? During normal infections, Adenoviruses associate with coagulation factor X, and this helps them to hide from the immune system. Now we know that people who get colds aren’t dying from systemic clotting every winter, so it seems that the human adenoviruses that most vaccines are based on have figured out how to coexist peacefully with humans.
Problem: The adenovirus that the Astra Zeneca vaccine is based on is a chimp virus that humans in Africa do not seem to have ever seen, based on what antibodies they have in their blood. Is it possible that the chimp virus proteins when administered in large amounts trigger an immune induced clotting reaction in a small number of people? I have to say its plausible. But we don’t know."

e97bd323,What do blood clots feel like?,"They sometimes feel like getting stuck in a blood vessel!
If you mean, what does a person feel when they have a blood clot, which is not preventing bleeding (the reason that blood is supposed to clot)?
The answer is that most blood clots are tiny and cause no symptoms. A larger blood clot in a critically important blood vessel causes symptoms that depend upon whether the clot is in an artery or a vein, and in which part of the body. Symptoms could include swollen leg, chest pain, breathlessness, weakness, blindness, unconsciousness, death. If you’re lucky the blood clot disperses before any permanent damage is done."

6b6299b6,Why doesn’t menstrual blood clot?,"There are some differences between normal and menstrual blood. The major one is the presence of anticoagulants in the menstrual blood.
The body produces and releases anticoagulants during menstruation to stop the blood from clotting. However if the rate of flow is above the normal limits, then there is a chance that the anticoagulants may not have enough time to work properly and there may be bright red or dark blood clots.
Blood clots are most of the times physiological or normal but it may also be a warning sign of problamatic pregnancy. It can happen after a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or other pregnancy related problems."

From the Mayo Clinic website Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
Many factors can increase your risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and the more you have, the greater your risk. Risk factors for DVT include:
Inheriting a blood-clotting disorder. Some people inherit a disorder that makes their blood clot more easily. This inherited condition may not cause problems unless combined with one or more other risk factors.
Prolonged bed rest, such as during a long hospital stay, or paralysis. When your legs remain still for long periods, your calf muscles don't contract to help blood circulate, which can increase the risk of blood clots.
Injury or surgery. Injury to your veins or surgery can increase the risk of blood clots.
Pregnancy. Pregnancy increases the pressure in the veins in your pelvis and legs. Women with an inherited clotting disorder are especially at risk. The risk of blood clots from pregnancy can continue for up to six weeks after you have your baby.
Birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy. Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) and hormone replacement therapy both can increase your blood's ability to clot.
Being overweight or obese. Being overweight increases the pressure in the veins in your pelvis and legs.
Smoking. Smoking affects blood clotting and circulation, which can increase your risk of DVT.
Cancer. Some forms of cancer increase the amount of substances in your blood that cause your blood to clot. Some forms of cancer treatment also increase the risk of blood clots.
Heart failure. People with heart failure have a greater risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism. Because people with heart failure already have limited heart and lung function, the symptoms caused by even a small pulmonary embolism are more noticeable.
Inflammatory bowel disease. Bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, increase the risk of DVT.
A personal or family history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (PE). If you or someone in your family has had DVT or PE before, you're more likely to develop DVT.
Age. Being over age 60 increases your risk of DVT, though it can occur at any age.
Sitting for long periods of time, such as when driving or flying. When your legs remain still for many hours, your calf muscles don't contract, which normally helps blood circulate. Blood clots can form in the calves of your legs if your calf muscles aren't moving for long periods"
eae519bf,Why are white blood clots passed through menstruation?,"Causes of menstrual clots
During menstruation, the endometrial cells that line the uterus strip away and leave the body.
As this happens, the body releases proteins that cause the blood in the uterus to coagulate. This coagulation prevents the blood vessels in the uterine lining from continuing to bleed.
The blood that the body has already shed also contains these coagulation proteins.
When the flow is most substantial, the coagulation proteins within the blood may start to clump together, resulting in menstrual clots.
This generally occurs when menstrual blood pools in the uterus or vagina before leaving the body.
Possible health conditions
Although it is normal to have clots in the blood during menstruation, this symptom can sometimes signal a medical issue. It is advisable to seek medical advice if the clots:
are larger than a quarter in size
are very frequent
occur with an abnormally heavy flow that requires a person to change their pad or tampon at least every 1–2 hours
occur with significant pain
The following conditions may cause abnormal menstrual clots:
Uterine polyps or fibroids
A blockage in the uterus may stop it from contracting as it should, meaning that it cannot force the blood out as quickly as usual. The blood will leave the body more slowly so it will have more time to pool and form clumps.
The blockage can also cause a heavier flow, which results in more blood pooling.
Blockages may occur as a result of growths in the uterus. These include uterine polyps and fibriods, which are not cancerous but can cause other health issues without proper management.
Uterine polyps and fibroids consist of either endometrial or muscular tissue that grows in the uterine wall. They can cause symptoms such as:
persistent lower backpain
pain during sex,
feeling bloated
fertility issues
irregular spotting
Endometriosis
Endometriosis can cause painful and heavy periods.
Endometriosis is a condition that causes the tissues of the uterine lining to grow outside of the uterus.
This abnormality can lead to several symptoms, which may be worse around the time of menstruation.
Symptoms of endometriosis often include:
pain and cramping in the pelvis or lower back
very heavy periods, or menorrhagia
painful periods, or dysmenorrhea
discomfort or pain during sex
fertility issues
Adenomyosis
In people with adenomyosis, the uterine lining grows into the muscular wall of the uterus.
This can make the endometrial lining and uterine wall much thicker, which can lead to a much heavier flow during a period.
As a result, it is more likely that blood clots will appear in the menstrual blood.
Hormonal imbalances
The balance of hormones in the body is essential for maintaining a healthy uterus.
If the levels of specific hormones become unbalanced, many issues can occur, including heavy menstruation or clotting.
Pregnancy loss
During a miscarriage, or pregnancy loss, a person will usually pass a number of large clots, depending on the stage of the pregnancy.
Pregnancy loss can sometimes occur before a person knows that they are pregnant, so they may mistake an early miscarriage for a regular menstrual cycle.
Enlarged uterus
After pregnancy, a person’s uterus often remains somewhat larger than it was before. An enlarged uterus can also be due to structural issues, such as fibroids.
There will be additional space for the blood to pool in, which could lead to further clotting before it exits the body.
Bleeding disorders
Some bleeding disorders may be responsible for heavy menstrual flow, as they can affect the coagulation proteins that the uterine lining needs to stop menstrual bleeding.
Disorders such as platelet function disorder or von Willebrand’s disease (VWD) may cause abnormally heavy menstruation."
820c6acb,Can dehydration cause your blood to clot?,"Clotting is a complicted event. There certainly are things that will cuase you blood to clot full stop, right now. Put it in a glass tube with diatomaceous earth. And there are tings like heparin, or some snake venoms that will nearly completely prevent clotting.
But is the question of causing unwanted clots in the blood stream there are things that push a little bit one way or the other.
As you well know most people who get dehydrated, even severely, have no trouble with thrombi.
But you may have heard that anything the falls in the general category of ‘stress’ will at least slightly activate the clotting cascade. Rarely will this result in clots; but it could.
Dehydration will do that."
80b06884,Do some covid vaccines cause blood clots?,"No. There is absolutely no evidence of ant vaccine causing clots. There is no ingredient in the vaccine that has been implicated in causing clots. The hype in parts of Europe was a type of hysteria and was contrary to all the evidence of experts on the ground at all stages.
When giving mass vaccinations it is to be expected that people will fall ill and die from other things as happens in normal life. It is unfortunate but people get blood clots normally. Those reported under the vaccination reporting systems, are fewer than one would normally expect. Note that the reporting system is not there to establish a causal link just to note that the person had a jab and then has a medical event shortly afterwards.
The events have all been incidental with other ‘normal’ causations rather than the vaccine."

40ebff5d,"What does it mean if every time you shoot meth, your blood clots in the syringe?","One of the four answers below is probably a lot closer to the truth than the other three, can you guess which one? Blood clots in the syringe can mean
you are leaving it in the syringe too long, and allowing air to get to it. (you pull the hype back from the needle, then set it down.) Air will cause blood to clot if left to sit too long.
You’re ‘jacking’ it too many times. ‘Jacking’ will cause the same effect as #1.
When I was shooting a lot of coke I had the same problem, it was that the coke was cut with an ingredient that made blood clot. I wasn’t much interested in the science or medicine side of the drugs so I don’t know what the ingredient was, I only know that I asked a doctor why my blood clotted so quickly, and that’s what he told me.
I’m not saying that the other 3 responses are wrong exactly, however IMO they don’t really answer the question that I’m sure (as another user) you’re asking. If it does burn, answer #4 may also be a contributing factor.
My suggestions would be
A. If you’re hard to ‘hit’, get someone who is good at it to do it.
B. Don’t jack more than once, maybe twice; best scenario is put it in and take it out. Fullness of the high without any of the hassle.
C. Don’t try to save any after you’ve tried to hit yourself and gotten blood in it. Better thing would be to split the liquid, do all of one, then later on do all of the other.
Of course the best thing to do would be to quit, but you will when you’re ready. Nothing I can say will change that, so until you do, I want you to do it safely. DO change needles as often as possible. If you can’t change them every time, at least squirt bleach through them 3 or 4 times. DON’T use the needles after they’re dull. This can lead to tearing the skin which makes you more susceptible to infection. DO rinse your cooker when you’re done. Reusing a dirty cooker doesn’t add anything to the shot, and you may be injecting contaminants that can hurt you. (Dirt, lint, etc.) DON’T share needles with anyone; you don’t know what they have, or who they’ve shared with.
Good luck, and be safe."
3b136490,What causes blood clots in the heart?,"There are two main types of blood clots in the heart. clots that form in the heart itself, or clots that travel via the veins from other locations in the body (eg Deep Vein Thrombosis). In addition to this some conditions thicken or change the consistency of the blood making clotting more likely (cancer, leukemia, diabetes, atherosclerosis, inflammation, dehydration, infection), and some people are born with genetic predisposition to clotting problems or problems that affect the smoothness of the inner lining of the circulatory system making clotting more likely for them even when they are healthy (eg clotting disorders like Factor V Leiden, Connective Tissue disorders).
Clots that form in the Heart
To oversimplify, the situation, clots that form in the heart itself usually do so because the blood in not flowing ideally, or there is lose of smoothness of the lining of the heart or major blood vessels, or foreign matter there that acts as a catalyst for blood clot formation.
Foreign Material, or rough surfaces providing focus for clot formation
Things like faulty heart valves, scar tissue or artificial heart valves, or vegetations (sticky clot bits) on valves from infection (from dental problems or IV drug use for example), can encourage clots to form within the chambers of the heart itself. Foreign materials from medical interventions, like central venous lines, PICC lines and other cardiac catheters can also provoke a blood clot within the heart itself.
Blood flow problems or abnormalites leading to clot formation
If there is an electrical or conduction problem with the heart, and it does not beat in a well coordinated way, there can be areas within the heart where blood can be relatively stagnant, and clots form, (atrial fibrillation is an example of a heart rhythm problem that affects blood flow, and can lead to blood pooling and not flowing well in parts of the atria), in the heart. likewise clot formation in the heart is likely after/during a heart attack, when blood flow is abnormal or may stop altogether for a while.
Clots that form in the heart can effect the efficiency of the heart, or dislodge, and travel to block circulation in any part of the body, causing problems like strokes (clot material travelled to brain)
Clots that form outside the Heart
Many factors can contribute to clots forming outside of the heart, particularly related to blood flow, foreign matter, genetic susceptibility, injury or provokation by an illness or condition. Deep vein thrombosis is one common example. Things like airplane flights or bedrest when recovering from surgery , can mean there is little movement, blood pools and clots are more likely to form. Medical interventions, the insertion and use of cannulas, and central lines add foreign material to the bloodsteam and can be the focus for clot formation. Many illnesses and conditions can contribute to cardiovascular disease.
DVT and Embolisms
Pieces of blood clots in large deep veins can break off, and travel through the great veins back to the heart. A broken piece of a clot that travels is called an embolus (or multiple is emboli). A pulmonary embolism is a life threatening complication that can occur after a deep vein thrombus… this is a piece of clot from a DVT that travels to the heart, and is pumped by the heart into the circulatory system of the lungs, blocking circulation and oxygenation downstream from the clot.
Clots that form in blood vessels that supply the heart.
Another major category of blood clot problems related to the heart, but not strictly in the heart chambers, is the blockages of arteries that supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart. This is referred to as coronary artery disease, where the walls of the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply the heart), are thickened or scarred with things like cholesterol deposits in plaque. The thickened irregular walls of the blood vessels can restrict or affect blood flow to the heart, and even provoke the formation of a blood clot. Medical interventions like stents and Coronary Artery Bypass surgery can be used to get through or around blockages, to restore blood flow to the muscles of the heart."
33727fbf,Can a blood clot form under the skin?,"YES!
This condition of veins when a blood clot forms just below the surface of skin is called Superficial thrombophlebitis.
It usually occurs in the legs, but it can occasionally occur in the arms and neck. Anyone can develop superficial thrombophlebitis, but females are affected more than males.
As clots/bruises heal, usually within 2 to 4 weeks, they often turn colors, including purplish black, reddish blue, or yellowish green. Sometimes the area of the bruise spreads down the body in the direction of gravity. A bruise on a leg usually will take longer to heal than a bruise on the face or arms.

dbc4390a,Does the AstraZeneca vaccine for COVID-19 cause blood clots?,"It’s really, really helpful to look at the actual numbers.
How many people have been given AZ’s vaccine thus far in Europe and the Uk?
About 17 million.
How many DVTs have been reported post-vaccination thus far?
15.
How many Pulmonary Emboli?
22.
So, 37 cases of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) in total.
What are the major risk factors for DVTs and PEs?
Amongst many others, advanced age, prolonged immobility and cancers. Could these risk factors be present in prioritised populations for vaccination during this pandemic?
Now, to compare:
What is the population of Australia?
A bit over 25 million.
How many cases of DVT/PE do we see in Australia, on average, every day?
About 50.
So, really, all of this reaction is about a better-than-average day’s worth of cases for Australian emergency departments and haematology clinics, in populations that had a lot of reasons to have clots regardless of whether they were vaccinated or not.

6655e963,Can a blood clot in my leg kill me?,"Possibly. The biggest risk is a chunk of it breaking off and travelling to your heart or lung and killing you. Small pieces likely wouldn't but a chunk could prevent the heart from contracting or kill you if it's in the lung (not sure how). I have also heard of rare cases where a clot in the leg blocked circulation enough to lose the leg. What you need to do is see a doctor and have him/her give you medication to break down the clot slowly enough that there is little risk if death. Not sure if surgery is needed in severe cases or not, but I wouldn't rule it out."

d76c899c,What treatment is to be taken for a blood clot in the brain?,"Thrombolysis = Clot busting after a brain hemorrhage is ruled out by doing a brain CT (which will only show you a non bleeding stroke after 3 days).
It means infusing the alteplase (r-tPA) see Page on wikipedia.org
and by doing so making the clot dissolve and open the blocked blood vessel again, so trying to revive the brain tissue from wholly dying off because receiving no blood=oxygen.
It has been shown that this has to be done within 3 hours after the start of the symptoms, or there would be no viable brain tissue left to recover after the clot was dissolved.
Scoring the disabilities after the treatment, there was a 11% to 17% difference (depending on the scoring method) between patients in the placebo treated and actively treated group with minimal to no neurologic disability at 3 month, very imposing results, just consider what being severely paralysed means for the patient's possibility to live an independent life. The price to pay seemed to be a higher risk of brain hemorrhage in the actively treated patients 19,8%, later studies showed that there was no difference in brain hemorrhage between the treated (17%) and placebo (21%)patients.
See Thrombolysis for Stroke
See also

and

So the main effect of thrombolysis is a better quality of survival, with 10 to 17% of people having minimal to no neurologic defects after three month, not a lot less deaths.
After this depending on what the underlying cause is, either oral anticoagulant or low dose aspirin, and rehab./physiotherapy.
For many it also means tackling a previously undiagnosed or neglected high blood pressure, which will lower the chance of having another stroke
Lowering serum cholesterol didn't lower the risk of having a stroke, though, but prevented other cardiovascular problems including peripheral arterial disease.
from Improving Stroke Prevention and Treatment Now

As you can see blood pressure controle even in the USA isn't as we would wish it to be: just 35% are adequately treated!

EDIT after the question was edited (essentially changed!):
the problem are the epileptic fits caused by brain ischemia (not getting enough blood) due to the clot he had had many years ago, so far too late to be dissolved (not possible at that time). So nothing can be done about the old brain infarct ion(that is brain tissue that died) due to the clot, and that was what was seen on the brain scan, since the clot can't be visualized (communication problems I would say).
The therapy as rightly asked is to find the right anti-epileptic meds against his seizures=fits, this is for a neurologist, there are neurologists who specialize in the treatment of epilepsy, maybe you can find one for him. Nothing can be done about the 28 year old blood clot in his brain."

259044de,How do you get rid of a blood clot in your leg?,"Hello,
How isit that you think you have a blood clot in your leg?
I have read all the previous answers. And there many treatment options in treating a DVT.
Your treatment is going to be biased on several factors.. Treatment for DVT usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines. These reduce the blood's ability to clot and stop existing clots getting bigger.
Heparin and warfarin
are 2 types of anticoagulant often used to treat DVT. Heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting. After initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming. Lovinox
A number of anticoagulants, known as directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), may also be used to treat conditions such as DVT. These medications include rivaroxaban and apixaban, and they've been shown to be as effective as heparin and warfarin with less serious side effects.
You'll also be prescribed compression stockings to wear every day, which will improve your symptoms and help prevent complications.
I hope this helps?"
c3cc80c1,Why doesn't blood clot in blood vessels normally?,"Blood coagulation starts when vessel wall is damaged! There is collagen layer beneath the endothelium which triggers coagulation cascade through a mechanism known as intrinsic mechanism. Plus, tissue factor (a clotting factor, a protein molecule which is required for clotting) enters circulation through damaged blood vessel. This factor triggers clotting mechanism through one more way known as extrinsic mechanism.
Normally, the collagen layer is not exposed to inside of the vessel. This fact together with smooth endothelial surface and flow of blood keeps blood from clotting. (that's very short summary of a long process of coagulation!)"
107c0fb2,Do they hospitalize you for blood clots?,"It depends on where the clot is and what it’s doing.
If the clot is in the heart causing a heart attack, or brain causing a stroke, then one would hope it is pretty evident that you would need a hospital stay for treatment!
Where it becomes more nuanced are with clots elsewhere - commonly in the deep veins of the legs (Deep Vein Thrombosis, or DVT), or in the lungs (Pulmonary Embolism, or PE).
With PE, clots can cause an entire spectrum of illness. This can range from a mildly increased shortness of breath on exercise, to cardiac arrest and death. This is of course dependent on the extent of the clot, and the availability of working lung. A small clot in someone with lungs riddled with emphysema will have more of an impact than a similar clot in a health set of lungs!
In patients at the milder end of the spectrum, with normal vital signs, good home social situation and a low risk of mortality (calculated using systems such as the PESI score), outpatient management is entirely appropriate - that is, anticoagulation at home (either oral or injectable). The evidence we have suggests that in low risk patients, hospital stay is unnecessary, and does not improve outcomes. If however, there are clinical signs suggesting a more serious illness, a hospital stay would be indicated - for treatment and observation.
With DVT, again it depends on illness - more often than not though, it would be managed at home. The only exceptions I can think of would be for patients who can’t take blood thinners due to high bleeding risk (and thus require filter insertion to prevent clots breaking off and travelling to the lung), or who can’t walk and have no support at home.
Hope that helps!"

3bbe4bb2,Are microchips the reason for death from blood clots in vaccines?,"Not really.
About 40 years ago, I was working for the CIA, conducting experiments on inserting microchips into flu vaccines for the Alien Overlord from the supernova Cygnus-X, who I will refer to from now on as AOC.
In those days, the microchips were so large that you could see them in the vaccine bottles, so we were not able to do what AOC wanted. So we asked Bill Gates to help, and in return for us supplying him with sex slaves, he was able to help us get the chips to be small enough so that they were not noticed.
Part of my job was on working on the method of programming the chips once they were inserted. As you may know from getting your pet microchipped, this is usually done before injection, but we had no instructions from AOC at the time what she wanted us to program the chips for.
I was able to come up with a clever way of programming the “flash memory” on the chip, using a compact high frequency microwave generator that would “burn” in the code, in much the same way as we program ROM (read only memory) with ultraviolet light.
But it took a while before AOC was confident enough in our ability to get the vast majority of Americans vaccinated for some “fake virus”. So for the most part, our initial experiments were just getting the chips in, unprogrammed, waiting to be “flashed” with the microwave imprinter.
Now as you may know with the microchips used for household pets, even though these chips are very large in comparison, and do not cause blood clotting. And that is because once they are in the body, there are no more blood clotting issues once the entry is healed up.
So I can assure you that there is no danger of blood clotting from the microchip itself. The danger is only when the candidate is selected for “programming” and someone is able to get close enough to the microchip to place the microwave “imprinter” on the skin, to program the chip below.
One of the things I worked on, for the Deep State Department, in the CIA, was a way of getting the imprinter to work without the candidate knowing about it at the time. I already knew that the easiest way to do this was as part of a mass operation at airports, forcing people to go through a “scanner” so that they could be imprinted, so that the imprinter could be remotely engaged, as part of the scanner “process”.
I had then left the CIA by the time they arranged to have the World Trade Center destroyed in “fake terrorist attacks” but someone I knew still at the CIA warned me about the attacks, so i was able to warn my sister, who would have been there on that day if I had not told her about it.
Since by then I had myself been programmed by AOC, I watched the events of 9–11 on a computer screen, with tears of laughter running down my cheeks. Or at least AOC thought I was laughing.
Since then, the technology has proved itself.
The Patriot Act resulting from 9–11 made it possible for the Deep State to automatically program anyone who had a flu vaccination, and every child who had an MMR vaccination, whenever they came through a US airport and went through the “scanners”.
This already made it possible to elect Hussein Obama as president, as by then enough Americans had been programmed.
Because of all the confusion caused by the evil Obamacare, the private health insurance companies who are responsible for the excellent medical care that Americans get, did not notice the increase in blood clotting caused by the “scanners” when they programmed the microchips.
But the United States still needed a way of getting more Americans to get a fake vaccination. The initial attempt by the Chinese, with their first fake virus (SARS) did not get any Americans vaccinating for it.
But the second time around, the Chinese were able to create a fake virus in a lab, that only killed American citizens. I believe they were personally rewarded by AOC with sex slaves, supplied by Bill and Melinda Gates from the third world, and pizza, supplied by Joe Biden’s sex slave operation in Washington.
This made is possible for enough Americans to get injected with the microchips, where in many of the places they were programmed at the same time, so that Joe Biden could be elected president, even though he still had to use dead people to vote.
And as I know from my own work on this, very often the “microwave based” programming would result in blood clotting, because it was done too fast and was still an experimental technology that altered DNA.
Another side effect was that some people who supported the REAL president were manipulated by AOC and their programming to attack Congress, and to say that they wanted to kill AOC, so that she could pretend that she was afraid of them being only a third of a mile away down a corridor from her office.
But the simple fact is that it is not the microchips themselves that cause the blood clotting, but the microwaves used to program them.
And if you believed any of this, you are even more stupid and ignorant than the person who asked the question."

Across the whole of the area served by the EMA, that's the EU plus Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein, there have been 30 people who have developed blood clots after taking the vaccine, that is out of nearly 5 million people who have been vaccinated¹.
So as a proportion that is 0.036 per 1000 person-years.

[Edit]
As the question has been altered, here's a quick answer to the new version …
Are the reports of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine causing fatal blood clots real?
The reports are real the correlation is very shaky in my opinion but some governments are taking the attitude of better safe than sorry.

What should people that have already taken the vaccine do now?
Erm, get on with their lives, what else can they do.
If they start getting symptoms indicative of an embolism then they need to get medical attention* that is no different to normal and from the figures is no more likely than normal.

9121fe9c,Can contraceptive pills cause strokes and aneurysms?,"Contraceptives containing estrogen CAN cause strokes because estrogen increases the clotting ability of your blood. They can’t cause aneurysms, which are congenital (you’re born with them).
As somebody already said, though, pregnancy ALSO increases your risk of stroke — you’re chock full of estrogen during pregnancy!
Because I had my first stroke while I was on the pill, I was instructed to stop taking it immediately. I was told under no circumstances should I get pregnant within a year, and that pregnancy could be very dangerous for me.
I went to the university hospital near me for my pregnancy, and was instructed to take Lovenox twice a day to prevent further blood clots. Later in my pregnancy (~ month 8), I switched to low-molecular-weight-heparin, which can be reversed with vitamin K in case you need an emergent C-section. Thankfully, dd was born without any complications =)

04b39743,Why is Covid-19 causing strokes in otherwise healthy people under 50?,"Covid-19 is a multi-organ disease.
First, the molecule, called ACE-2, which the virus uses to dock to the cells of the human body, is present on many different cell types. Hence it can enter the cells of different organs directly.
Second, one of the cell types the virus can enter, are the cells of the inner wall of blood vessels (endothelium). If a virus enters a cell and replicates there, the cell usually gets destroyed at the end (by the virus and/or the immune system). This means: wall-of-blood-vessel cells get destroyed. The destruction of blood vessels is a very strong trigger for blood clotting which in turn can cause congestion of the blood vessel. A closed blood vessel can cause an infarction in the tissue downstream (if there are no other blood vessels transporting blood there, too) as there is no glucose and oxygen anymore which any cell needs to function and survive. To cut this long story short: In addition to directly attacking many different organs, the virus causing Covid-19 can cause damage in all organs as it can damage blood vessels and this way cause a vasculitis.
“Briefly, necropsy and post-mortem biopsies of decedents with COVID-19 reveal macro and microvascular thrombosis involving arteries, veins, arterioles, capillaries and venules in all major organs” (from: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11239-020-02230-4
, you need to scroll down to “Vascular endothelial cell pathology in COVID-19”).
An infarction in the brain is called stroke (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke

In some cases, it’s obvious what caused a stroke: if somebody’s obese, has really high blood pressure, is really old, etc., it’s pretty clear-cut.
But I was 115 pounds, 90/60, and 24 years old when I had my stroke. My doctors looked at me, referred me to a cardiologist for another test, which was negative, and told me to go on my way. “The chance of you having a subsequent stroke is very small,” they assured me.
Six months later, I was back in the hospital with another one. =(
About six months after THAT, I was able to peer out from beneath my lead jacket of fatigue and pick my head up enough to wonder WHY I’d had a second one. It’d be nice to figure it out, I wagered, to prevent a third one. At that point, I’d already decided that if I had another one, JUST LET ME DIE.
My speech therapist referred me to a neurologist at the big city hospital nearby. In retrospect, he was nuts, but he did decide to perform a test just to check for certain that the cardiologist I’d originally seen hadn’t missed anything. (The first test, a TEE — trans esophageal echocardiogram — checked for a hole in my heart by sticking a camera down my throat look to look at my heart. The second test, a TCD — transcranial doppler — shot minuscule bubbles into my arm via an IV and listened to my brain to see if any of them made it up there.) Lo and behold, it dinged! I had a hole in my heart that allowed bubbles/clots/etc to pass through a ventricle and into my brain.
But, a week later, the neurologist called and said he wasn’t sure that the hole was the cause of my stroked. He explained that doctors usually require both a hole and a hypercoagulable disease — i.e. you need a hole in your heart and a reason to have a clot. “Why the h*ll did you have me do this test, then?” I wanted to shout.
To make a long story short, I decided to go ahead and have surgery to close the hole. It’s not terribly risky, but it is heart surgery. I haven’t had another stroke in 12 years, I’ve had a very good neurologist tell me that clots sometimes form in the area right around the hole *just because*, I’ve had doctors tell me to get my head screwed on straight — everybody knows a hole isnt enough without a hypercoagulable disease … I’ve pretty much just given up having any chance of ever knowing what caused my strokes.
So please, figure it out! LOL"

When surveying “problems” with getting high on drugs, you have to notice the percent of the population experiencing a particular effect. A lot of problems with drug use have to do with a genetic predisposition rather than the drug per se. For instance, a biggy is lung cancer and tobaccor. Only about 0.15% of smokers get lung cancer and only about 0.015% of non-smokers get lung cancer. This might be 10x higher, but if smoking caused cancer 95% of smokers would get lung cancer. With respects to this particular condition, the “risk” is 20% greater for a Cannabis user which is not substantial IMO nor was this data extracted from a “normal” population but from a population showing up to the hospital.

3f377d56,Why high blood pressure could leads to stroke?,"I am Denise Kelly. Let me share some high blood pressure tricks from Peggy Chavez’s website: Top 8 tips that can help to lower your high blood pressure in just 9 mins. Peggy Chavez is a famous blogger about blood pressure.
Peggy Chavez’s Tip 1: Lose weight. Being overweight means that your heart has to pump blood to a larger body mass, which makes the heart work harder. Losing weight reduces the workload. “Plus, your heart will be better able to respond to circumstances that do require more work, like exercise,” says Dr. Zusman.
Peggy Chavez’s Tip 2: Exercise. Any activity that gets your heart pumping faster and your lungs working harder is one of the best ways to lower high blood pressure. “It improves the blood vessels’ ability to open and close, which improves blood flow,” says Dr. Zusman. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.
Peggy Chavez’s Tip 3: Reduce your stress. Chronic stress may contribute to high blood pressure. More research is needed to determine the effects of chronic stress on blood pressure. Occasional stress also can contribute to high blood pressure if you react to stress by eating unhealthy food, drinking alcohol or smoking.
Peggy Chavez’s Tip 4: Reduce sodium in your diet
Peggy Chavez’s Tip 5: Control underlying conditions.
Peggy Chavez’s Tip 6: Stop caffeine.
Peggy Chavez’s Tip 7: Limit alcohol intake.

3e8c09b7,Why do people that suffer from migraines have a higher risk of stroke?,"Yes it can. There are several migraine types that can—one reporter on TV, in fact, about a year ago, had a migraine attack on screen and they thought she had a stroke. It is very common.
To test if it is a stroke or migraine is hard because if you have hemiplegic, one side of your body will go off-line and tests for stroke will show stroke even if that’s not what you have. It is best to get into the hospital for a doctor’s examination to see if it is a stroke or migraine.
Migraine is an electrolyte imbalance caused by the over-activity of the sensory neurons. In a migraineur’s brain, the sensory neurons have much more connections than the same neurons in a typical non-migraine brain. This is why migraineurs tend to be overstimulated by strong bright lights, strong odors, loud sounds, more sensitive to touch, and some (like me) also are super-tasters, so more sensitive to spices.
Because of the hyper-reaction of the brain to sensory stimulus, it generates more voltage—voltage is communication in the brain—and that extra voltage uses more sodium. Migraineurs need more salt in their diet to counter this effect. A study showed that migraineurs lose over 50% more sodium in their urine than non-migraineurs—eating the same thing.
Migraineurs are also glucose sensitive (carbs intolerant) because glucose removes sodium and water from cells—therefore, carbs reduce brain sodium even more for migraineurs, causing a migraine.

972991b4,Can a lot of stress cause a stroke?,"Yes, In “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers” author, Dr. Robert Sapolsky explains how chronic stress can cause hypertension and atherosclerosis, aka the accumulation of plaques in the blood vessel. Dr. Sapolsky writes about the incredible findings of physiologist Jay Kaplan from Bowman Grey Medical School.
According to Kaplan and his colleagues, primates will form atherosclerotic plaques after social stress. If you turn a monkeys stable dominance hierarchy on its head the end result is enough social stress that provokes a stress response and an overactive sympathetic nervous system.
Overall, the monkeys under the most social stress were most likely to form these dangerous plaques.
Last but not least, once these plaques are formed in the blood vessels, chronic stress may cause increase blood pressure. The increase of blood force is more likely to tear the plaque loose. The now mobile plaque can then make its way to a blood vessel in the brain and cause a stroke!"

This could drive a stroke or heart attack or a cardiac arrest it is recommended that after waking up take about 3–5 minutes before showering.

607d780a,What food is most likely to increase my risk of a stroke?,"Don’t believe anyone knows the answer to that.
Most folks will probably say anything with salt. However, I’d say table salt, which has had the good trace minerals removed, is a more legit answer and hopefully more folks are using a real salt with its health benefits.
What is not appreciated re: strokes is blood sugar issues. Diabetics have a significantly higher risk of stroke and more issues, so I’d say, as usual, sugars and carbs—which the body converts to sugar—need to be watched for good reason by everyone.
Again it’s balance because we want some carb foods—carbs in most anything including healthy vegetables and seeds—so would be insane to try to get rid of them all, but makes sense to eat nutrient dense foods and space the carbs out somewhat instead of piling into them in one meal.
Liked Mercola’s Fat for Fuel and Ketofast books and how he talks about NOT going full on keto 365 days a year but to have a couple of super stringent low carb days, a couple of “feast” carb days for 2 days, and for 3 more moderate between those extremes.
Keto is more than low carb, however; it is high HEALTHY fat and that offers some real cardiovascular pluses. Worth looking into and discussing with your doc."

Could the Nazi Party survive an economic collapse? What am I talking about?
The German government, under Nazi Party leadership and control, had perpetrated a huge fraud on the German people. When they took power in 1933, German government debt was about 10 billion Reichsmarks and unemployment was over 30%.
Some of their immediate actions in 1933 included privatization of several state-owned businesses and imposing tariffs on imports. These sound like normal actions in a bad economy, right? But, the German economy wasn’t that bad off. In fact, it was recovering from the initial shock of the Great Depression. But, that wasn’t good enough so…
They ‘helped’ reduce unemployment (a little) by forcing Jewish educators, workers, civil servants, and business owners out of the workforce. This left some room for non-Jewish Germans.
They banned political opposition to get their plans through and then banned all unions. Workers had to get permission to quit a job and employers had to get permission to reduce their workforce. The Nazis gave out public works project jobs to those companies that used manual labor over labor-saving machinery.
To finance the military rearmament, and keep it off government spending, they created a fictional company called MEtallurgische FOrschungsgesellschaft m.b.H. (or “MEFO” for short). The Nazis then ‘persuaded’ the top 4 armament manufacturers in Germany to front 1 billion Reichsmarks. MEFO issued promissory notes to get that money with a 4-year maturity. The Nazis then discounted the notes, basically turning them into a separate currency.
Over the next 4 years, MEFO issued 12 billion Reichsmarks in promissory notes. By the time they started coming due, the Nazi government didn’t have the money to pay the notes off. So, what did they do? They forced German banks to buy government bonds to pay off the promissory notes.
Where did the banks get that kind of money? Why, from depositors of course. They didn’t ask the German people if they wanted to buy 12 billion Reichsmarks in dubious government bonds. Oh, and the non-MEFO debt the government was carrying in 1938 was closer to $19 billion instead of the $10 billion they had inherited.
In 1939, the guy who originally came up with the idea at the Ministry of Finance was forced to resign. It was a massive scam that put the German economy deep in debt and bordering on collapse.
So, what saved it? In a word: plunder.
Confiscating the personal and business wealth of German Jews was a start but certainly not enough. So, off to war to plunder Poland. Then other nations of Europe.
If, as you ask Hitler dies before summer 1939, would the invasion of Poland go on without him? Well, all of the invasion elements were in place once the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed 23 August 1939. This pact allowed Germany to invade Poland without triggering an immediate response from the Red Army.
On the other hand, the Anglo-Polish Military Alliance - signed on 25 August 1939 - did force Germany to pause the planned invasion of Poland from the 26th to 1 September. Hitler ordered the invasion anyway but would that have happened if his successor was (a) not solidly in control and (b) confident enough to attack anyway. Any less confidence and it could be called off.
Earlier in the summer before the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement is in place? I doubt the invasion happens. Nazi plans probably lose steam at that point.
Nazis did believe ‘war’ was the “primary engine of human progress” [Wikipedia: Economy of Nazi Germany] but did all of the Nazi leadership believe it enough to risk war? Many in the German Army were not certain the invasion could work. Others were convinced. So, I suspect it depends upon who landed where in those top leadership posts. Which of the political types maneuvered their way into key positions?
And, back to the economy… I guess the Nazis could have kept patching the economy with debt for some years but it would eventually fail. Anyone who knew how it really worked would have pushed for war to ‘fix’ the debt problem.
So, it depends.
Economy of Nazi Germany - Wikipedia
National economy of Nazi Germany Like many other Western nations, Germany suffered the economic effects of the Great Depression with unemployment soaring around the Wall Street Crash of 1929 . [1] When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he introduced policies aimed at improving the economy. The changes included privatization of state industries, autarky (national economic self-sufficiency) and tariffs on imports. Weekly earnings increased by 19% in real terms from 1933 to 1939, [2] but this was largely due to employees working longer hours, while the hourly wage rates remained close to the lowest levels reached during the Great Depression. [3] In addition, reduced foreign trade meant rationing in consumer goods like poultry, fruit, and clothing for many Germans. [4] The Nazis believed in war as the primary engine of human progress, and argued that the purpose of a country's economy should be to enable that country to fight and win wars of expansion. As such, almost immediately after coming to power, they embarked on a vast program of military rearmament , which quickly dwarfed civilian investment. [6] During the 1930s, Nazi Germany increased its military spending faster than any other state in peacetime, [7] and the military eventually came to represent the majority of the German economy in the 1940s. [8] This was funded mainly through deficit financing before the war, and the Nazis expected to cover their debt by plundering the wealth of conquered nations during and after the war. [9] Such plunder did occur, but its results fell far short of Nazi expectations. [10] The Nazi government developed a partnership with leading German business interests, who supported the goals of the regime and its war effort in exchange for advantageous contracts, subsidies, and the suppression of the trade union movement. [11] Cartels and monopolies were encouraged at the expense of small businesses, even though the Nazis had received considerable electoral support from small business owners. [12] Nazi Germany maintained a supply of slave labor , composed of prisoners and concentration camp inmates, which was greatly expanded after the beginning of World War II . In Poland alone, some five million people (including Polish Jews) were used as slave labor throughout the war. [13] Among the slave laborers in the occupied territories, hundreds of thousands were used by leading German corporations including Thyssen , Krupp , IG Farben , Bosch , Blaupunkt , Daimler-Benz , Demag , Henschel , Junkers , Messerschmitt , Siemens , and Volkswagen , as well as Dutch corporation Philips . [14] By 1944, slave labor made up one quarter of Germany's entire work force, and the majority of German factories had a contingent of prisoners. [15] Pre-war economy: 1933–1939 [ edit ] Recovery and rearmament [ edit ] The Nazis came to power in the midst of the Great Depression . The unemployment rate at that point in time was close to 30%.

MEFO - Wikipedia
MEFO was the more common abbreviation for ( German : MEtallurgische FOrschungsgesellschaft m.b.H. , English: Society for Metallurgical Research LLC ), [1] a dummy company set up by the Nazi German government to finance the German re-armament effort in the years prior to World War II . Origins [ edit ] This dummy company was set up in May 1933, just after appointment of Hjalmar Schacht as Reichsbank President in March 1933, as a front for purchases from four German armament manufacturers, Krupp , Siemens , Gutehoffnungshütte , and Rheinmetall . The four were persuaded to put up the initial share capital of 250,000 Reichsmarks . [2] The German government was not openly involved in any way; on paper, MEFO was entirely a private company, in reality, the company had two directors, one appointed by the Reich Ministry of Defence and the other by the Reichsbank. The four companies pooled together over 1 billion Reichsmark (equivalent to 4 billion 2017 euros) where the National Socialist government agreed to repay the money with five-year promissory notes known as Mefo bills . [3] [4] Soon afterwards, the Nazis discounted these notes (known in German as Mefo-Wechsel), basically turning them into a type of currency. [5] Between 1934 and 1938, Mefo bills worth a total of 12 billion Reichsmark were issued to pay for rearmament. To put that into context, Germany's national debt in 1932, the year before Hitler took power, was only 10 billion Reichsmark. By 1938 the official admitted national debt was 19 billion Reichsmark -- but the Reichsmark 12 billion in Mefo bills has to be added on top of that. In other words, Hitler and the German Minister of Economics , Hjalmar Schacht, tripled Germany's national debt in just six years, but more than half of the increase was off the books. When the MEFO notes fell due in 1938, the government discovered a serious cash shortage. To resolve the problem, the Nazi regime employed “highly dubious methods” where “banks were forced to buy government bonds to be used to repay these bills, and the government took money from savings accounts and insurance companies. This made the ordinary German citizen the financier of the German rearmament.” [6] Eventually, the government had to resort to the printing press to help mitigate the cash shortage. It was one of the key components of Germany's rearmament program and was invented by Hjalmar Schacht, who then was head of the Ministry of Economics, and Plenipotentiary for the War Economy. After assuming power in 1933, the National Socialists realized that rearming Germany would require funds that were not likely to be generated from taxes or public loans. In addition, the need to keep the rearmament effort secret led to the creation of this dummy company. Transactions [ edit ] The transactions that led to the re-armament financing were conducted as follows [7] Armaments manufacturers were contracted to produce arms Mefo bills of exchange were drawn by these contractors as payment for th

Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact - Wikipedia
1939 neutrality pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union ""German–Soviet pact"" redirects here. For the Weimar-era German–Soviet non-aggression pact, see Treaty of Berlin (1926) . The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that enabled those two powers to partition Poland between them. The pact was signed in Moscow on 23 August 1939 by German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov [1] and was officially known as the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . [2] [3] Unofficially it has also been referred to as the Hitler–Stalin Pact , [4] [5] Nazi–Soviet Pact [6] or Nazi–Soviet Alliance [7] (although it was not a formal alliance ). [8] [9] Its clauses provided a written guarantee of peace by each party towards the other and a commitment that declared that neither government would ally itself to or aid an enemy of the other. In addition to the publicly-announced stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included the Secret Protocol, which defined the borders of Soviet and German spheres of influence across Poland , Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia and Finland . The secret protocol also recognised the interest of Lithuania in the Vilnius region , and Germany declared its complete disinterest in Bessarabia . The rumour of the existence of the Secret Protocol was proved only when it was made public during the Nuremberg Trials . [10] Soon after the pact, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin ordered the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September, one day after a Soviet–Japanese ceasefire came into effect after the Battles of Khalkhin Gol . After the invasions, the new border between the two countries was confirmed by the supplementary protocol of the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty . In March 1940, parts of the Karelia and Salla regions, in Finland, were annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War . That was followed by the Soviet annexation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and parts of Romania ( Bessarabia , Northern Bukovina and the Hertza region ). Concern for ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had been used as pretexts for the Soviets' invasion of Poland. Stalin's invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact since it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence that had been agreed with the Axis. [12] The territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union after the 1939 Soviet invasion east of the Curzon line remained in the Soviet Union after the war ended and are now in Ukraine and Belarus . Vilnius was given to Lithuania. Only Podlaskie and a small part of Galicia east of the San River , around Przemyśl , were returned to Poland . Of all the other territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939 to 1940, those detached from Finland (Western Karelia , Petsamo ), Estonia ( Estonian Ingria and Petseri County ) and Latvia ( Abrene ) remain part of Russia , the successor state

Anglo-Polish military alliance - Wikipedia
The military alliance between the United Kingdom and Poland was formalised by the Anglo-Polish Agreement in 1939, with subsequent addenda of 1940 and 1944, [1] for mutual assistance in case of a military invasion from Germany, as specified in a secret protocol. [2] [3] [4] British assurance to Poland [ edit ] On 31 March 1939, in response to Nazi Germany 's defiance of the Munich Agreement and its occupation of Czechoslovakia , [5] in Parliament, the United Kingdom pledged the support of itself and France to assure Polish independence: ...in the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence, and which the Polish Government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty's Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Polish Government all support in their power. They have given the Polish Government an assurance to this effect. I may add that the French Government have authorised me to make it plain that they stand in the same position in this matter as do His Majesty's Government. [6] The British Chiefs of Staff at the time however noted that ""we could give no direct help by land, sea or air."" [7] On 6 April, during a visit to London by the Polish foreign minister , it was agreed to formalise the assurance as an Anglo-Polish military alliance, pending negotiations. [8] [9] The text of the ""Anglo-Polish Communiqué"" stated that the two governments were ""in complete agreement on certain general principles"" and that it was ""agreed that the two countries were prepared to enter into an agreement of permanent and reciprocal character..."". The British Blue Book for 1939 indicates that formal agreement was not signed until 25 August. [10] That assurance was extended on 13 April to Greece and Romania , after Italy 's invasion of Albania . [11] Agreement of Mutual Assistance [ edit ] On 25 August, two days after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact , the Agreement of Mutual Assistance between the United Kingdom and Poland was signed. The agreement contained promises of mutual military assistance between the nations if either was attacked by some ""European country"". The United Kingdom, sensing a trend of German expansionism , sought to discourage German aggression by this show of solidarity. In a secret protocol of the pact, the United Kingdom offered assistance in the case of an attack on Poland specifically by Germany, [3] but in the case of attack by other countries, the parties were required only to ""consult together on measures to be taken in common"". [12] Both the United Kingdom and Poland were bound not to enter agreements with any other third countries that were a threat to the other. [13] Because of the pact's signing, Hitler postponed his planned invasion of Poland from 26 August until 1 September. [14] Failed Soviet-Franco-British alliance [ edit ] After the German occupation of Prague in March 1939 in violation of the Munich agreement, the Chamberlain government in Britain sought Soviet an

My suspicion is that it's not so much that younger patients are more susceptible, more that they probably aren't going to get treated as early as they should. Younger, healthier patients, especially men, will often delay care if they aren't suffering from severe symptoms.

Toss in the fact that many people have died from it or an associated cause, but have not been tested (especially early in the pandemic) and the current figure of 90,000+ deaths is likely much lower than actual, but who knows by how much?

Culpability remains. If the stroke is so severe that the patient has a ""locked-in syndrome"" in which communication is virtually or literally impossible, the court may choose to conditionally release the individual to a care facility or home care, on compassionate grounds, as a prison setting is wholly inadequate for managing the stroke sequelae.
If, on the other hand, the stroke occurred after the alleged crime, but before the trial, the defendant should, most likely, not be prosecuted unless or until he or she is cognitively and physically capable of assisting in his or her own defense. With such a severe stroke, recovery would be unlikely. This situation would be very rare, but certainly conceivable.
A stroke that causes complete global amnesia for a long period of time (more than a few hours before or after the stroke), but spares even limited speech or cognition is exceedingly rare. Vanishingly so. There are case reports scattered through the literature, but most doctors will never see such a devastating stroke during their careers.

d6657db0,Could having a terrible argument with someone cause a stroke?,"The simple answer is “Yes.” A stroke is damage to a portion of the brain due to a rupture of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke), a localized clot in a vessel (thrombotic stroke), or a clot that travels from another part of the body, usually the heart or an artery (embolic stroke).
Arguing can sometimes get very heated. This can cause a release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are some of the chemicals the body activates as part of its “fight or flight” response to a danger or acute stress. These chemicals raise blood pressure, speed up the heart rate, and can trigger cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beats). In a patient who already has high blood pressure, their sudden release can worsen that condition to the point that it causes a stroke through a brain hemorrhage or the spasm of a cerebral artery. Even in patients without known high blood pressure, a very sudden increase in blood pressure could cause the rupture or spasm of a cerebral blood vessel, especially if that vessel is already weakened by an aneurysm (weakening in the muscular wall of an artery), or plaque (the deposition of cholesterol and calcium in the wall of an artery which can weaken it, or cause it to close off). If blood doesn’t flow through an artery, or if the artery ruptures, it will likely result in permanent damage to the portion of the brain that vessel supplies with blood, which is what a stroke is.
A cardiac arrhythmia can also result in a stroke due to the temporary interruption of blood flow to a cerebral artery. These stress chemicals may also cause a sudden heart attack, which could reduce blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
Incidentally, stress can also cause the body to produce another adrenal hormone from the adrenal cortex known as cortisol. The effects of cortisol are generally not as acute, but tend to me more prolonged. It is certainly conceivable that chronic arguments could also lead the body to make more cortisol which can raise blood pressure.
There is also a phenomenon known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) which is caused by a temporary interruption of blood supply without permanent damage to the portion of the brain whose blood supply comes from that artery. This is commonly known as a “mini-stroke,” which could also be caused by a heated argument for the same reasons as stated above, and resolves without a permanent deficit.
There are countless stories of individuals who had strokes, or heart attacks after a sudden stress, which could include a heated argument."
51bd9145,Can a massage cause a stroke?,"To give an honest well informed answer to this question is hard because lot of post massage incidents go unreported .
There are random sporadic incidents of adverse events caused by Massages ( given by non professionals ) . The possibility of Stroke can not be ruled out if neck is the site of massage in a person who has Carotid artery Stenosis or someone with hyper coagulable blood with a clot sitting somewhere in the neck .
Inadvertent pressure on the Neuro vascular bundle in the neck can have its own complications since they are very superficial and Can have direct impact like shearing and tearing of the blood vessels in case of excess or inappropriate pressure application . Not forget the Pressure of carotid sinus can have its on effects . So having said even though this all is a possibility in theory some side effects are well documents but with low incidence . On the other hand benefits of massage therapy are also well documented .
In a nutshell - side effects are rare but possible .
Careful selection of trained massage professional is a must .
Full medical history , any medication intake and any medical or surgical concerns must be shared and risks disclosed between both giver and receiver of the massage .
For academic purpose here is an article of interest. A must read .
Sixteen case reports and four case series of adverse events after massage therapy were found. Massage was frequently used for rheumatological conditions. In the majority of these cases causality is established con- vincingly, for instance, through the sequence or nature of events. Some of the adverse effects relate to serious complications.
Considering the popularity of massage therapy, the number of reported adverse events seems minute. How- ever, this could be due to under-reporting. In a related area (spinal manipulation) we have, for instance, shown that under-reporting of serious adverse events is close to 100%
Clearly, one should differentiate between various approaches. The above findings suggest that massage by non-professional and forceful techniques like shiatsu, urut and Rolfing are relatively often associated with adverse events. The reports reviewed above are often incomplete. For instance, the background of the therapist and the type of massage therapy are not always described. This further limits the conclusiveness of the evidence.
Several systematic reviews of controlled clinical trials testing the effectiveness of massage therapies have been published and have arrived at cautiously positive conclusions . However, too few clinical trials of massage therapy exist and many of its claims are not backed up by evidence. Thus adequate risk–benefit evaluations are not feasible.
In conclusion, massage therapies are not totally devoid of risks. The incidence of adverse events is unknown, but probably low.

79cbeba7,Does a stroke cause permanent brain damage?,"I had a major stroke at age 52 which changed my life forever. My right side was paralyzed from head to foot, and I lost my speech. I had daily physical, occupational and speech therapy for a long time and off and on again for years after that first year and still to this date to keep me functioning. I still cannot walk well after 26 years because my ankle never recovered. My car still has to have a left-fooot accelerator so I can't rent a car which limits traveling. I won't go in to all the details.
Yes a stroke does cause permanent brain damage because the stroke continues for around 48 hours destroying more of your brain by either depriving it of oxygen or flooding it with blood.
Another result which I happened to suffer is RSD, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. now known as Complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS. That is horrible. Intractable pain more severe than anything anyone can believe. It is the result of trauma, in this case brain trauma.
This may be more than you were looking for but if you were wondering if your brain gets all better by a certain time and things go back to normal, NO. Maybe you're wondering if someone you know will ever be the same. I have lots of residual issues which people can't see but I have to deal with. People having a major stroke like mine can kiss their paychecks good bye. You can no longer do the work you did before. And likely never will. But I'd say I'm doing pretty good for having half a brain!"
61a2197d,"After a stroke caused by a clot, how long does the blood clot remain in the brain?","There is an adage that when something involves the brain, it's like real estate - it's all location, location and location. Even with the evolution of intracranial bleeds, location (what space they occur in) is important. The Question suggests it is about intracerebral bleeds (blood within the brain itself, instead of around it), so I will answer accordingly.
All clot within the brain eventually reabsorbs, if the patient lives long enough. There is much variability in how long this takes, but in general, the larger the clot, the longer it takes.
A small ""bruise"" may disappear in a week or two on CT or MRI. A larger clot may take 3 - 6 weeks to clear. The really big ones may clear in terms of their density on CT, but will show permanent MRI changes and leave a cavity and distorted residual brain behind.
Please keep in mind that if you look hard enough (for example, using PET scanning, or post-mortem fine histology) you can find identifiable residua more often and for a longer time.
Also keep in mind that such structural evaluations have only a weak relation to how well the brain functions around the clot, and how quickly recovery of that function takes place.
Anyone who has been in this business long enough will remember a patient with normal CT and MRI who nevertheless exhibits a deep and prolonged coma. On the other hand, we occasionally see surprisingly good function in patients with impressive clots in so-called ""non-silent"" parts of the brain.
It's amazing I think to see how the body has a sense of what tissue belongs where and in what quantities - even in the brain, which is more isolated from healing and immunological cells than other organs.
Hope this helps!"

5cf4b8a0,Can chiropractic adjustments induce stroke?,"I don’t know where the other two answers got their information, other than perhaps anecdotally. The FACTS are that the likelihood of a person having a stroke in a chiropractor’s office are no greater than having one in a medical doctor’s office. A Review of the Literature Regarding
Stroke
and Chiropractic
The myth that chiropractors cause strokes is (1) based upon a misunderstanding of the difference between correlation and causation, and (2) by the American Medical Association’s organized effort to destroy an honorable profession whose philosophy is to avoid drugs and surgery by finding and correcting the underlying cause of a health issue. (The latter was validated by a Federal Court finding the AMA guilty of those charges.)
Look, the malpractice insurance premiums paid by chiropractors to insurance companies is orders of magnitude less expensive than premiums paid by medical doctors. Do you think those companies are just being nice, or is it more likely that more people are hurt and/or die in the hands of medical doctors? How do the critics explain that???
The elephant in the room is a recent study by John Hopkins University which concluded that on average 250,000 people die EVERY YEAR IN THE USA due to “iatrogenic causes,” meaning incorrect medical diagnosis or treatment. QUOTE: “ Analyzing medical death rate data over an eight-year period, Johns Hopkins patient safety experts have calculated that more than 250,000 deaths per year are due to medical error in the U.S. Their figure, published May 3 in The BMJ, surpasses the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's third leading cause of death—respiratory disease, which kills close to 150,000 people per year.” Johns Hopkins study suggests medical errors are third-leading
cause
of death in U.S.
And yet, if even one person dies while receiving chiropractic treatment (which is not the same as being CAUSED by chiropractic treatment) it’s front page news.
Open your eyes people. Health, in many cases, comes from identifying and correcting the underlying cause of disease not from a bottle of pills or removal of organs."

99e7baf6,How can migraines cause a stroke?,"So sorry to hear of this, OP!
For various reasons, I track migraine and stroke related research. A lot of that research seems to have been conducted on women. The summary of all I know so far is as follows:
1. There is a known correlation between migraine with aura and the risk of stroke.
2. A stroke can induce a migraine or occur in the course of a migraine, and in the latter case can lead to a full stroke.
3. A migraine can induce a stroke if other underlying conditions for a stroke exist and interact with the pathologies caused or precipitated by a migraine.
4. Stroke due to cardiovascular disease may look like a migraine.
5. Both stroke and migraine can share a pathology or underlying brain or neurological disfunction (which are still less than well understood).
6. Many migraine related strokes cannot be classified clearly. For instance: tryptans, which are often prescribed to migraine sufferers and whose action is vasoconstrictive, may interact with the migraine pathology and precipitate a stroke.
Any or some of these may explain your experience but it appears what we know is less than adequate. One of my pet peeves is how underfunded migraine research is although an estimated 7-10% of the UK population suffers from it. Pathology being poorly understood means hardly any material on prevention (except hit and miss food triggers), little understanding from health care providers, awful management of pain and other side effects. I have so far heard of one specialist who works on the cusp of neurology, pain pathology and specialisation in migraine (and no, the person who told me couldn't remember his name either!).
Wishing you good health. I shall keep an eye on the question to see what we can all learn. Thanks."
2b92226d,What causes repeated TIA strokes? Are there any symptoms that occur ahead of a TIA?,"TIA = transient ischaemic attack, brief neurological symptoms that resolve fully (Scan shows no recent abnormality)
Stroke = symptoms don’t fully resolve within 24 hours (Scan shows recentabnormality)
Strokes can be split into MINOR STROKE = can function independently despite deficits & MAJOR STROKE = needing help because of deficits.
NOTE: TIAs are often called MINI-STROKES, causing some confusion with ‘minor’ stroke.
Also TIAs are often misdiagnosed (diagnosis is based on description of fleeting symptoms), so recurrent symptoms may be due to another cause (like hypoglycaemia in diabetics).
TIA & stroke are caused by a blockage of blood flow to a part of the brain.
Roughly speaking, duration of blockage predicts type of presentation. (Brief seconds > TIA; minutes > minor; permanent > major)
All indicate that something is wrong in the body causing a tendency to clot (prothrombotic), and thus risk of recurrence.
TIA is the initial ‘warning’ symptom, and some (about 1 in 4) people have one or more TIA(s) before a stroke.
Repeated TIAs indicate the need to consider…, if not already done (not an exhaustive list, but covers main issues):
Is there disease in the carotid artery? “Carotid atheroma” - detectable by an ultrasound Doppler usually.
Is there a cardiac arrhythmia? If not seen on an ECG, consider longer term cardiac monitoring to seek intermittent or paroxysmal irregularity.
Are there risk factors that are poorly controlled? - e.g. current smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes are the most prominent.
Are the appropriate medications being prescribed and taken as prescribed?
I would suggest a medical review to consider the above. Hope this helps.
Have a look at the UK National Health Service webpage on TIA: Transient ischaemic attack (TIA)"

Yes and no.
When the arterial blood supply to a tissue is compromised, the tissue dies. This is called an Infarction
.
Peripheral nerves have arteries that provide their needed blood supply, the Vasa nervorum
. If the vasa nervorum are compromised, the nerve will infarct. This can happen with compression, diabetes, vasculitis, atherosclerosis, etc. The result can be a mononeuropathy, a mononeuritis multiplex or a generalized polyneuropathy (Peripheral neuropathy
).
In the brain, if an artery is compromised, an infarct will likewise occur. In the brain, and in the brain only, tissue infarction is also called a Stroke
. It's the same process as infarction anywhere else, but, for historical reasons, it's given it's own unique designation."

In some states, it depends.
People v. Spragney
in California was one:
The facts concerning the accident, which resulted in the death of a 10-year-old girl, are tragic but brief. At about 8:45 a.m. on July 7, 1970, defendant speeded through a red light at the corner of Santa Barbara and Broadway in Los Angeles. He collided with a Volkswagen in which the victim was a passenger.
Court papers say that Isaiah Spragney crawled out of overturned car. He ""staggered and appeared unable to maintain his balance"":
His coordination was wild. There was no pattern to the way he used his hands. His movements were both rapid and slow. His eyes were wide open, and his pupils constricted. He had a fixed stare. His speech was slow, slurred and not understandable. He was smiling, laughing, and muttering. His responses were rambling and unintelligent.
Because Spragney had a seizure.
Prosecutors charged him with vehicular manslaughter.
A jury found him guilty. He got a year in jail.
Spragney asked for a new trial. His motion was denied. So his lawyer, future Superior Court Judge G. Thomas Thompson
, appealed…
…And won.
Said the Court:
The prosecution's initial theory that defendant was driving under the influence of a drug was pretty well destroyed by the medical evidence.
The Court agreed that ""unquestionably unconsciousness was a defense to the charge"" under California law, Pen. Code, § 26, subd. 5:
The only legal basis for a finding of fault on the part of defendant was the weak inference that he was, or should have been aware of medical reasons why he ought not to drive an automobile.
California Jury Instructions include No. 4.30:
a ""person who ""unconscious commits what would otherwise be a criminal act, is not guilty of a crime
and No. 4.31
""If the evidence raises a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in fact conscious, you must find that he was then unconscious"".
In this case, the Court applied the defense of unconsciousness based on a seizure caused by psychomotor epilepsy.
Alas, things went less smoothly for Ashlie M., a teenage girl who killed pedestrian Pedro Beliz as she drove home from work in 2007.
Ashlie had a California learner's permit. She wasn't supposed to be driving.
She claimed she had a blackout at some point and could not remember much of the accident she caused. Her lawyer said she was entitled to the “unconscious” defense because she was unconscious.
The People were merciful. Amazingly,
Appellant was cited for vehicular manslaughter, unlicensed driver, and failure to provide proof of insurance, but the District Attorney's office chose to file only one count of driving without a license.
As punishment, The People ordered Ashlie to pay for Pedro Beliz's funeral.
More amazingly…
Ashlie's lawyer objected.
He said Pedro Beliz was dead because he was walking on a dark street at night wearing dark clothing. This was his fault. Why should she pay for his burial?
The Court disagreed:
The trial court found as a matter of fact that “the minor's lack of skill, her inexperience, ․ played a role in this.” The evidence supports the juvenile court's finding.  Appellant was unprepared for the common traffic encounter with a bicyclist, was unable to control the car despite traveling at only 37 miles per hour, and never even knew she hit the pedestrian. Her actions and omissions cannot be explained away by blaming the pedestrian (as she does) for being there wearing dark clothing and the city for the absence of streetlights.
It's all in here: In re: Ashlie M.
That's the rule in California. But every state is different.
When it comes to paying damages, I have seen guilty drivers escape judgments by filing for personal bankruptcy. An injury caused by willful or malicious conduct is not dischargeable. An innocent mistake? Perhaps."

On 3 May 1996, Ahmed Deedat suffered a stroke which left him paralysed from the neck down because of a cerebral vascular accident affecting the brain stem, leaving him unable to speak or swallow.[16] He was flown to King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, where he was reported to be fully alert. He learned to communicate through a series of eye-movements via a chart whereby he would form words and sentences by acknowledging letters read to him.[16]
He spent the last nine years of his life in a bed in his home in South Africa, looked after by his wife, Hawa Deedat, encouraging people to engage in Da'wah (proselytizing Islam).[16] He received hundreds of letters of support from around the world, and local and international visitors continued to visit him and thank him for his work.[1]
On 8 August 2005, Ahmed Deedat died at his home on Trevennen Road in Verulam in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. He is buried at the Verulam cemetery.[17] Hawa Deedat died on Monday 28 August 2006 at the age of 85 at their home.[18]"
3727cb6f,How do babies get stroke?,"That's a great question because as you may be aware, neonates (babies within the first month of life) have a much higher rate of suffering a stroke than older babies/children.
The reason they suffer from stroke during this period is largely unknown but there are a few causes we know of for sure (note: although there are known causes, often when it happens you don't know which of the causes it may be). Regarding causes, I'll break it down to causes of the types of stroke. There are two types: the one where the artery gets clogged (thrombotic stroke) and the one where the artery bleeds out (hemorrhagic stroke). Thrombotic stroke is more common in neonates and adults alike.
Thrombotic stroke: Firstly, clots can form in the placenta and be transported to the baby's blood vessels both in utero and during childbirth. Other causes during pregnancy are poorly controlled diabetes, high blood pressure (preeclampsia), certain infections (especially with high fever), illicit drug use, PROM (premature rupture of the membranes - when the water breaks too soon), and when the placenta separates from the uterine wall (abrupt placentae). Childbirth itself poses a risk. The birthing process is traumatic and much pressure is exerted on the baby's head, this can cause clots to form. This is worse with vacuum extractions and forceps deliveries. Deliveries with complications where the baby is deprived of oxygen are also a potential cause. At birth, they are born with a high percentage of red blood cells and this can clog the arteries as well. In addition, breastfed babies tend to get mildly dehydrated after childbirth because mom's milk hasn't come in yet, just a bit of colostrum - so the blood thickens further, increasing the risk of clotting. Causes that have nothing to do with pregnancy or childbirth may include clotting disorders that don't prevent/stop blood clotting, sickle cell anemia, heart defects, certain genetic disorders heart disease, and certain infections like chickenpox or meningitis.
Hemorrhagic stroke: Preemies are particularly susceptible to this type of stroke because their arteries and veins are not fully developed so they are extremely fragile. They can easily break or tear, causing the blood to leak out. And the aforementioned birthing trauma can lead to damage to the vascular system also, causing hemorrhagic stroke as well, particularly relating to head injuries sustained as a result. Blood vessel defects (including aneurysms) and blood clotting disorders that prevent the blood from clotting (eg. Von Willibrand's disease, haemophilia, Factor XIII deficiency) are also potential causes.
But as I said the vast majority of the time the cause is unknown. So I guess the answer to your question is nobody knows but it could be a million things..."

aae88a79,What causes cylinder pressure to be below the atmosphere during the intake stroke?,"The piston is drawing a vacuum to pull in the intake charge (air and fuel mixture).
As the piston lowers, the cylinder volume increases. Air must flow into the cylinder to fill the larger space. The pressure drop below atmospheric is due to air moving by the intake and valves to fill the expanding cylinder volume.
If the cylinder were fully open on top, the pressure drop would be relatively low. This is one reason, with very wild camshafts that the intake vacuum is not adequate to operate accessories (vacuum distributor advance, vacuum power brakes, etc). The long duration of the camshaft allows the airflow to be far less restricted and thus lower pressure drop.
Original Question:
“What causes cylinder pressure to be below the atmosphere during the intake stroke?”"
f41367b4,Could a lack of sleep cause a stroke?,"Proper sleep is required for our cardio vascular system to work well. Sleep deprivation can indeed cause stroke.
During sleep your mind repairs the body, processes information to form memories and refreshes you . You can't function without it. So have a minimum 6–8 hrs of sleep daily."
0832e9d7,Can anxiety cause a heart attack or a stroke?,"Anxiety can definitely make worse already pre-existing heart diseases. Typical anxiety progress in the way that it triggers flight/fight response. This leads to flooding of the bloodstream by hormones activating a whole range of adaptations to such situations.
Basically, all unnecessary processes — like digestion & higher-level cognition are switched off — whereas muscles including the heart get most of the blood supply. It automatically leads to activation of the cardiovascular center that stimulates sympathetic innervation in the heart.
This is where things become interesting. Increased sympathetic heart activation leads to a much higher heart rate and stroke volume what dramatically increases the heart minute output. This sharply increased demand on the heart can trigger a whole range of pre-existing heart conditions and diseases.
Heart palpitations.
Atrial fibrillations.
Angina pectoris.
Heart infarction. It is a quite dangerous situation.
Deadly ventricular tachycardias: Torsades de Pointes arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Those are quite dangerous too.
There is good news. It is known that you can hit those two birds — heart infarction & anxiety — by one stone. It can be accomplished by the proper diet of our great grandmothers, which heals large intestine, stop inflammation there and subsequently in the body including arteries, and which substantially elevates the level of the precursor of serotonin (produced by healthy bacteria).
As simple as this it can become :-)"
853fb289,Can single strokes cause progressive dementia?,"Short answer: No. Vascular lesions of the brain may result in dementia, but usually only in the presence of multiple strokes.
Long answer:
A single stroke generally doesn't cause progressive cognitive decline[1]. However, multiple insults over a period of time (usually spanning years) will result in diffuse damage to the brain, and patients can lose function in stepwise fashion, which mimics the progressive decline of what is popularly considered ""dementia"". Treatment is oriented towards prevention of future vascular events, generally by controlling stroke risk factors. Examples of pathology include:
blood vessel diseases
hypertensive hemorrhages
amyloid angiopathy
cardiac emboli (clots)
post-ischemic diffuse brain damage
[1] It can, however, cause global disturbances in behavior or memory which can be misinterpreted as dementia by those not trained in neurology. For instance:
Anterior cerebral artery infarcts may result in abulia and generalized apathy usually associated with difficulty in planning future tasks.
Middle cerebral artery infarcts may cause aphasias or hemineglect.
Posterior cerebral artery infarcts may result in visual agnosias, cortical blindness, achromatopsia, prosopagnosia, or amnesia in bilateral disease.
Very unlucky infarcts that affect certain sensitive regions of the brain, such as the medial thalamic region, may also result in severe, non-progressive memory disturbances after one ischemic event."

I’m not sure about insulin and strokes. I checked the literature and didn’t find anything that corroborates what your nurse said. I do know, however, that uncontrolled diabetes raises your risk of having a stroke. So, if you have been prescribed insulin, you should take it as your doctor tells you to.
Anyone who has diabetes should be careful about their sugar/carbohydrate intake. Ideally, you should try to limit simple carbs like soda, white bread and rice, and sweets. Not all carbohydrates are bad for diabetics. Complex carbs like those you find in whole grain breads, unsweetened granola, and beans — those are good for you in moderate amounts. These kinds of carbohydrates digest more slowly, so they don’t cause your blood sugar to jump as high as things like soda or sugary foods (simple carbs).
Of course, as a diabetic and as someone who is taking insulin, you should always be sure to have some glucose tablets at your disposal. You can find them at the drug store and they look something like this:
Being on insulin raises your risk for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This can happen if you accidentally take too much insulin, or if your blood sugar is lower than usual and you take the prescribed amount of insulin. It’s not uncommon for people who are on insulin to have their blood sugar drop too low. If this happens, you may feel lightheaded, anxious, sweaty, and jittery. You could even faint. This is very dangerous. These tablets can help if that happens. You should carry them in your purse, in your car, and have some in your kitchen and/or bedroom. Orange juice or soda is also good for quickly raising your blood sugar if it drops too low. But I like these tablets because they are easy to carry and they work really quickly.
Hope this helps,

A Fib makes it more likely you will have a stroke, but the majority don’t have one.
Atrial fib predisposes to forming clots in the heart (in the lt. atrial appendage), and they can break loose, go through the blood (carotid artery) and stop in the brain, causing an embolic/ischemic stroke.
So arterial embolus is the correct answer—with atrial fib being the most common predisposing cause."
fea4ff45,How long does it take for a stroke to cause brain damage?,"4 minutes due to the lack of oxygen.
With ischemic strokes the blood clot or emboli that blocks the blood flow to the part or parts of the brain to oxygenate the brain. Small strokes are small because it affects a smaller part of the brain; where large strokes can involve multiple lobes of the brain, even.
With hemorrhagic strokes the blood that escapes the blood vessel is damaging to the brain tissue. Why hemorrhagic strokes have worse symptoms and outcomes, too. The inflammation blood can cause is dreadful, as the body attacks itself thinking it’s a contagion."
8cdf576c,Can sneezing cause a stroke?,"Yes, a violent sneeze or cough can burst a blood vessel in the brain and cause a hemorrhagic stroke.
It would be extremely rare in a healthy person but quite possible in someone with thinned or fragile blood vessels."

23770321,Is excess sugar consumption one of the factors in causing a brain stroke?,"…not necessarily. Brain strokes occur due to brain cell being deprived of oxygen caused by an irregularity of blood flow. This can arise from either a blockage in the form of a blood clot or a vesicular eruption in one of the brain layers.
Any prolonged excess of sugar or salt will cause an imbalance to the brain’s physiology and therefore exhibit itself by or with an ‘abnormal’ behavior."
d7570c5c,Do chiropractors ever cause vertebral artery dissection strokes by mistake?,"Yes, cervical vertebral artery dissections can occur with chiropractic neck manipulations. However, the incidence is very uncommon (rare) and within reasonable medical probability, a pre-existing condition causes this.
The research definitively shows that the chance of a catastrophic event/death by going to a chiropractor is actually less than going to your primary medical physician. Remember, any medical intervention, any pharmaceutical intervention, anything that doctors do to you has some risk. Goodness, even taking aspirin kills people!
BTW, tune out the naysayers that profess that chiropractic has no medical benefit. There is a plethora of research comparing chiropractic to medical interventions for musculoskeletal conditions which unequivocally show that chiropractic at least is as effective than medical treatment, and often more beneficial.
And, at least, going to your chiropractor reduces the iatrogenic possibilities of harm, greatly reduces the amount of opiates and other medications prescribed, and by reducing surgery, death."
16ea8cad,Is it possible for a stroke to just cause temporary hearing loss and deafness?,"Yes, it is possible for a stroke to affect hearing.
In more than one way too. I’ve can recall patients who’s hearing thresholds have dropped after a stroke, and then over the duration of months, even going on to years they have gradually recovered to pre-stroke levels. Whether this is down to blood flow, which there are drugs to increase blood flow to the inner ear or temporary atrophy around the auditory nerve or spiral ganglions, as they both carry electrical impulses from the hairs cells within the cochlea. I honestly do not know what the reasons are
There is also as Matt Ramsey mentioned, we hear sounds with our ears, but its the brain that makes sense of those sounds. This one I’d say is more common, the brains cognitive function is often affected after a stroke and understanding speech can be more difficult due to this, especially in noise. Given time the brain often recovers and this recovery will often lead to increased cognitive processing, which will always help with understanding speech, whether that's through hearing, lip-reading or the brain filling in the blanks from all the areas of the brain that often gets used by people with hearing loss due to neural plasticity of the brain.
The brain is an amazing muscle responsible for many things, and like any other part of the body, when its damaged it can recover. If you are asking this question due to someone you know, their hearing has been affected and they didn’t need hearing aids before the stroke, I’d recommend Oticon OPN S, or the soon to be released Oticon More. The way these hearing aids process sound can, and does support the brain in many ways with their BrainHearing technology. I wear these and they are amazing compared to all the other hearing aids I’ve worn in the past.

34af49e1,"Is a thrombus and an embolus the same thing? If not, which causes a stroke & which causes a heart attack?","They are not the same thing but they can lead to the same thing—ischemia—which produces strokes and heart attacks. A thrombus is a clot in an artery which causes obstruction of the artery and ischemia(low oxygen levels)—-most common cause of heart attacks. An embolus develops when a fragment of a clot in a peripheral artery breaks off and travels in the circulation to another site and causes obstruction of the circulation in the distant site, thus producing ischemia and a possible infarct. This is one of the most common causes of strokes—-for example, a clot in the carotid artery in the neck becomes unstable and a fragment breaks off and travels to the circulation in the brains producing obstruction, ischemia, and subsequently a stroke."

If you or someone you're with may be having a stroke, pay particular attention to the time the symptoms began. Some treatment options are most effective when given soon after a stroke begins.
Signs and symptoms of stroke include:
1 Trouble speaking and understanding what others are saying. You may experience confusion, slur your words or have difficulty understanding speech.
2 Paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg. You may develop sudden numbness, weakness or paralysis in your face, arm or leg. This often affects just one side of your body. Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time. If one arm begins to fall, you may be having a stroke. Also, one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile.
3 Problems seeing in one or both eyes. You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double.
4 Headache. A sudden, severe headache, which may be accompanied by vomiting, dizziness or altered consciousness, may indicate that you're having a stroke.
5 Trouble walking. You may stumble or lose your balance. You may also have sudden dizziness or a loss of coordination.
Causes
There are two main causes of stroke: a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may have only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), that doesn't cause lasting symptoms.
1 Ischemic stroke
Ischemic strokeOpen pop-up dialog box
This is the most common type of stroke. It happens when the brain's blood vessels become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia). Blocked or narrowed blood vessels are caused by fatty deposits that build up in blood vessels or by blood clots or other debris that travel through your bloodstream and lodge in the blood vessels in your brain.
Some initial research shows that COVID-19 infection may be a possible cause of ischemic stroke, but more study is needed.
2 Hemorrhagic stroke:
Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures. Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect your blood vessels. Factors related to hemorrhagic stroke include:
Uncontrolled high blood pressure
Overtreatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants)
Bulges at weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms)
Trauma (such as a car accident)
Protein deposits in blood vessel walls that lead to weakness in the vessel wall (cerebral amyloid angiopathy)
Ischemic stroke leading to hemorrhage
A less common cause of bleeding in the brain is the rupture of an abnormal tangle of thin-walled blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation).
Transient Ischemic Stroke:
A transient ischemic attack (TIA) — sometimes known as a ministroke — is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those you'd have in a stroke. A TIA doesn't cause permanent damage. They're caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain, which may last as little as five minutes.Like an ischemic stroke, a TIA occurs when a clot or debris reduces or blocks blood flow to part of your nervous system.Seek emergency care even if you think you've had aTIA because your symptoms got better. It's not possible to tell if you're having a stroke or TIAbased only on your symptoms. If you've had a TIA, it means you may have a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to your brain. Having TIA increases your risk of having a full-blown stroke later."
60af72cc,"Why is it that female hormones are thought to protect against heart disease, but to be the cause of strokes?","Prior to the menopause women have a quarter of the incidence of coronary disease of men .Many studies of HRT show a reduced incidence of heart disease this is also true for the WHI study with regard to women under 60 for both combined and oestrogen only therapy .No attention was drawn in this study to the fact that due to the rules, 33% of the control group ended up on statins and aspirin ie this therapy doesn’t work on women.
The lead investigator received an honorarium from Pfizer. The study was stopped early on the grounds that there was an excess of breast cancer in the study group on combined therapy ,similarly there was a deficit in the oestrogen only group These differences were not statistically significant and the authors retracted the finding. The Drops study also showed a protective effect further studies are about to be published.
So double blind studies show a protective effect as does casual observation.
he excess stroke risk may be due to an increased propensity to thrombotic episodes on estrogen,the difference in the WHI trial may however be due to the aspirin treatment of the control group.
HRT lowers cholesterol the failure to protect women over 60 against heart disease has been postulated as being due to arterial damage from the post menopausal lack of oestrogen .It however protects against hip fracture which biphosonates do not ,this is because oestrogens promote bone remodelling,both will protect against osteoporosis"
006bd79c,"My 3.5 HP two stroke outboard engine will only run for a few seconds, then it dies. What are some possible causes for this?","I will tell you exactly what the problem is. As with any 2 cycle engine,outboard motor, chainsaw,weed whacker, etc., there is oil mixed with the fuel. When the owner puts it away for the season, it is imperative that you drain the fuel from the tank and start the motor till the carb is empty and the motor quits. Most folks can”t be bothered, so springtime comes, the gas has evaporated from the carb, leaving, congealed oil plugging the fuel jet. Happens all the time. You have to take the carb off, pull it apart, clean the jet and float valve, with acetone,gas, or carb cleaner. Reassemble it. put in fresh fuel and oil. Two tugs and away it goes. I also switch out those tiny fuel lines,they sometimes get hard and brittle, and put in a new spark plug. Simple maintenance my good friend.Hope this helps"
bdd5484a,Do strokes cause people to pass out?,"Not always. The classic signs of a stroke are confusion with a sudden onset. Weakness on one side of the body, facial droop on one side of the body. Vision deficits on one side of the body. Inability to either express or understand words (expressive aphasia or receptive aphasia.) Difficulty swallowing (dysphasia). The person may or may not lose consciousness. To check if a person is having a stroke ask them to smile, if one side of the mouth droops it is a sign. Ask them to squeeze your hands. If one side is weaker or unable to squeeze, that is also a sign. Ask them to tell you their name, what day or season is it, and where they are. If they have trouble with any of those questions and it is new, it is a sign of cognitive decline. If you notice the symptoms right away they need to get to the hospital immediately because there is a short window of time when a clot busting drug can reduce the damage from a stroke.
When a stroke occurs on the left side of the brain it affects the right side of the body. When it happens on the right side of the brain the left side of the body is affected. Damage to the brain can be small to catastrophic. Typically, the person may regain some of the functions over a period of months to a year. Probably after a year they will not regain that function."
6f3c35db,What should I do about an alarming event of vaccination that caused my husband to have a stroke? It's been documented recently that shingles vaccine will cause this. Should I tell him?,"You got your research confused. It is shingles itself that increases the odds of a stroke. The shingles vaccine DIMINSHES the chance of a stroke.
What’s the link between shingles and stroke?
In two recent large studies, people who developed shingles were up to 4.5 times more likely to suffer a subsequent stroke, highlighting the value of immunization against the virus that causes this disease. That’s because any viral or bacterial infection sparks inflammation, and for people with cardiovascular disease (CVD), that could cause plaque in the arteries to become inflamed and rupture, much like a volcano spewing molten lava. The body’s defense to this injury is to form a clot, which can trigger a stroke if it blocks the flow of blood to the brain.
Here’s a sample search on “Does Shingrex cause stroke?” One source says it is a possible rare complication. However, look at the risk of getting a stroke if you get Shingles (which 30% of all adults do.) Here are some articles on the subject:

cabfe8ed,Which area of the brain is affected to cause impaired movement after a stroke?,"Motor control resides in the frontal lobe of the brain, in the regions I’ve labeled here. (The blue line marks the boundary between the frontal lobe and parietal lobe.)
Commands to the muscles below the head originate in the primary motor cortex, the long fold (gyrus) of tissue winding its way down from the top of the brain. Nerve pathways going from here to the muscles cross over to the opposite side of the body along the way, so a stroke on the left side of the brain can cause weakness or paralysis of the limbs on the right side of the body and vice versa.
The tissue immediately anterior to the primary motor cortex is called premotor cortex. This is where we think about how we’re going to move (like “walk quickly over to the door”) and the brain compiles a subconscious “plan” of muscular action. That plan, or program, is conveyed to the primary motor cortex, the executive center which then commands the muscles to perform that action. A stroke damaging the premotor cortex therefore can also result in impaired movement because one can’t decide what to tell the muscles to do, such as contracting the muscles needed to get up from a chair.
The control of facial, tongue, and pharyngeal muscles and some neck and shoulder muscles comes not from these centers but from the brainstem, via certain cranial nerves. These effects are usually seen on the same side of the body as where the stroke occurred. They can include signs such as sagging of part of the face, asymmetric tongue movement or strength, or difficulty swallowing.
As I’m sure you know, a stroke can also cause various speech impairments called aphasia, ranging from muteness or slurring to babbling incoherent speech.
The lower end of the primary motor cortex, on the left side of the brain in most people, is a major speech center called Broca’s area. A stroke here can cause Broca’s aphasia, characterized by slow speech, difficulty choosing one’s words, or speaking sounds that only approximate the sound of the intended word, like “tssair” for “chair.” In extreme cases, the stroke victim’s entire vocabulary may consist of only two or three words, sometimes the last words he or she was speaking when the stroke occurred. Such patients feel very frustrated with themselves, often maintain a tight-lipped reluctance to talk, and cut themselves off from social interaction.
Wernicke’s area at the rear of the parietal lobe is responsible for our ability to recognize spoken or written language (it lies at the intersection of our centers for hearing and vision), and just behind it (a triangular area of tissue that my red line to Wernicke’s area passes through) is an area, the angular gyrus, important to our ability to read and write. Wernicke’s area stores our memory of the vocabulary and grammar of languages we’ve learned. It’s here that we decide what we’re going to say, and signals are passed along tracts from here to Broca’s area directing it to execute the necessary muscular actions to say it (ranging from the diaphragm to tongue and lips). A stroke that damages the Wernicke area can cause Wernicke’s aphasia, in which a victim may babble on and on in a nonsensical “word salad,” make up nonexistent words, or may be unable to understand spoken or written words. Some people with lesions here have anomic aphasia (a- = without; nom- = names) in which they can’t think of the names of familiar things they once knew. Shown a picture of a chair, such a person might say, “Oh, I know what it is. I have a lot of them at home. I just can’t think what they’re called.” (My examples come from Ganong’s Review of Medical Physiology.)
These aphasias are fascinating and remind us of how much we take for granted about our speech. Here are some videos of speech therapists working with patients who have various kinds of aphasia. I find the third one especially heartbreaking."

In a single-cylinder engine, it is only the stored energy in the inertia of the flywheel (and the crankshaft itself) that keeps it going, and also through the intake and compression strokes of the next cycle. On large and slow-turning single-cylinder engines (historical ones, or still in use in some agricultural applications), you can directly observe the dramatic changes in angular velocity of the crankshaft as it progresses through the cycle.
In a multi-cylinder engine, the power strokes of the other cylinders are also applying force to input energy into the crankshaft, which can make for a much smoother operation of the engine."
50f7025a,We have a window over our bed. My wife claims that the cool night air on her head will cause her to have a stroke. Is there any logical explanation to verify that?,"I'm not a doctor, and my opinion / beliefs are my own, and not intended to diagnose or treat any ailments. Please talk to a medical professional to discuss.
That being said…
No, it has no relevance. Cool air actually helps improve sleep. When the body temp lowers, it knows it's time to rest / recharge. In fact, there are sleep aids that help lower the body temperature to help induce and maintain sleep as well as improve quality. Fresh air (from a window) also improves air quality. Newer houses are so efficient (no leaky windows, loose door, etc) that air quality has significantly decreased as well as proven increase of flu / cold, etc unless an air to air heat exchanger (heat recovery unit) has been installed to maintain efficiency and improve air quality. So the cool / cold air aids in quality sleep and improves air quality and respiratory health.
There has also been rumor that cold air has caused Bell's Pausy as well. To the best of my knowledge, that is an old wive's tail as well. Also considering that a proper Bell's Pausy diagnosis can be questionable and can take time, as it is only diagnosed by exclusion (no definative diagnostic test to prove it.
I think your wife may be listening to old family beliefs, old wives tails, etc. I bet you, if you got some cool fresh air, you'd both sleep better and feel better as well. Open the window after she falls asleep and close before she wakes. Do that for a few days and see if she feels better, then tell her :)

Would Brian Sicknick have died at that time but for being beaten round the head? Almost certainly not. Therefore being beaten round the head caused him to die. It doesn’t matter if he would have had a stroke the next day or if he would have lived for another fifty years with the risk of stroke. He died because he was beaten. So the people who beat him caused his death illegally. The only question is what version of homicide/manslaughter they should be charged with.
And, just in case you’re think that that sounds unfair, consider this. If someone is shot, the cause of death is often going to be blood loss. Would you say the shooter shouldn’t be accused of murder in that case?

Common High Blood Pressure Myths
The first part of your question, regarding the historically well-established link between salt and high blood pressure, is now in question. It’s not at all clear that salt intake will affect blood pressure in otherwise healthy people. That’s because the kidneys are designed to keep the sodium level (table salt contains sodium and chloride) in the blood stable. You will just pee off any extra salt you take in.
The other part of your question about treating blood pressure by drinking enough tap water is now moot because the base assumption is not accurate. If one had high blood pressure, drinking a lot of water would not affect your blood pressure unless your kidneys were not working correctly. As with salt, your body will pee off extra water (unless it’s an excessively large amount of water).
It is true, however, that long-standing untreated high blood pressure can damage the kidneys (along with other organs); in which case salt and water intake may need to be monitored closely because the kidney is now not as efficient at maintaining proper amounts of water and elements like sodium in the body.
Edit 2/26/2018: Liang-Hai Sie's answer to Should healthy people restrict their salt intake? is another point of view. I link to his answer because I find his answers to be well-researched and precise."
89274ba9,"If the cause of death of an individual has been determined to be a stroke, is it possible that this person has actually been murdered?","I’m an anime fan, so I’m going to show you an anime scenario where I guy is actually able to murder people using human problems that do, in fact, kill humans of natural causes.
It’s called Death Note.
The story follows the life of Light Yagami, a Japanese honor student who one day ran across a mysterious notebook called the Death Note. Figuring it was simple chainmail, like the ones you forward to the next person or something bad will happen to you, he tried to disregard it, but picked it up and took it home with him anyway. When he opened it, there was a set of instructions on the inside, the first being “The person whose name is written in this note shall die.” He figured it wouldn’t work, but something about the notebook compelled him to try it anyhow. On the television at the time was a crime in progress, and, to test the notebook, he wrote down the name of the criminal on television. As fate would have it, exactly forty seconds later, the criminal fell over dead from a heart attack. So he goes along executing criminals, making them out to look like natural causes for death, until they are eventually linked to murders, and he is caught and killed himself.
But that’s probably not what you’re looking for in an answer.
Moral of the story: If you figure out how to kill people through natural causes, like a stroke or heart attack, watch yourself and don’t abuse the power. Someone will find out they’re related eventually."

If the valve is still closing when the compression stroke begins, then some of the AF mix will make it’s way past the valve, so there will be less in the cylinder to be compressed when the valve finishes closing, and the actual compression begins."

3dc5ebd6,What weapons can cause someone to have a stroke?,
c44b710f,Can drinking too much beer cause somebody to have a stroke?,"I couldn’t figure out why you included that link, so I’m answering the general question.
Chronic alcohol consumption can be a risk factor for stroke. Beer is a form of alcohol. Many beer drinkers also smoke, which is another risk factor for a stroke. Heavy beer drinkers often develop a “beer gut”, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes all of which may contribute to the risk of stroke.
That said, there are other potential causes. The neurologist who did the workup on the stroke victim/survivor is likely to know more. The type of stroke, the location of the stroke and other “artifacts” seen in the CT and MRI images all tell a story.
As I rode in the ambulance from the ICU to the acute care rehab hospital, the EMT asked me how many strokes I’d had. I looked at him in surprise and asked “Do people do this more than once?” The notion of having another stroke was shocking to me. He said that people can have several strokes. The greatest risk factor for stroke is having had a stroke. That was sobering news.
If you/he/she has already survived a stroke, address the underlying issues with great commitment. It is not necessary to have multiple strokes.
Take blood pressure medication(s), if they are prescribed.
Stop smoking anything.
Exercise religiously, even if physical function is limited. There are always ways to get the heart rate up and keep it up for 30 minutes per day.
Reduce beer consumption to one 12 ounce 5% beer per day. Better yet, replace it with red wine. If you/he/she cannot stop after one drink, don’t drink at all, ever.
Learn about the DASH diet
and how to prepare and enjoy whole foods.
The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet eating plan has been proven to lower blood pressure in studies sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. In addition to being a low salt (or low sodium) plan, the DASH diet reduces blood pressure. It is based on an eating plan rich in fruits and vegetables, and low-fat or nonfat dairy, with whole grains. It is a high fiber, low to moderate fat diet, rich in potassium, calcium, and magnesium — all of which help manage hypertension.
See your doctor regularly for follow-up appointments.
If he or she did not survive the stroke, you have my sympathy. But for Grace, that would have been me. After I GOT out of the hospital I was shocked to read that 30–50% of those who have a hemorrhagic stroke do not survive. My daughter told me later that the neurologist told my husband that “if she survives the night, she should be ok.” I had no clue.
Quorans — please do all you can to avoid having a stroke yourself and encourage loved ones to do the same. Learn to recognize the symptoms of
stroke
. Thankfully, the receptionist at my office called 911 even though I insisted I was fine and to just let me sit quietly for a bit. The neurologist said she may have saved my life."
392d6fe2,What else can cause your arm to go completely numb besides a stroke?,"Pressure on a nerve in the arm or shoulder is the most common reason.
eople lying on the arm for an extended period of time will frequently have the sensation of the arm going numb. Common pressure points are the elbow where everyone knows what the ‘funny bone’ is and I am sure there are expressions in every language for the point where the ulnar nerve bends aroung the elbow and gets hit or pressed on. It is of course anything be funny!
Still the arm get wierd and the person gets up relieves the pressure and it is all OK.
Nerves simply cannot take a joke; they may be injured by significantly less pressure than muscles so it is a self protection mechanism that they have direct way to express “Get me out of here” to the brain.
IOf it resolves quickly its just life.
Pressure on nerves inside the spinal column is much harder to relieve and therefor more serious. This occurs much more often to the legs but it can as well affect arm whose nerve roots arise in the cervical spine.
In adequate blood flow could also do this but it is rare, even in patients with vascular surgery for dialysis in the arms."

a35311b7,What are all the causes for a 49cc 4-stroke pull start engine to not start?,"Most small engines have a pump to prime the system, make sure you prime the system before attempting to start the engine. Also small engines usually have a manual choke. Make sure to follow the choke instructions as per the manufacture for starting the engine when it is cold. Small engines when cold can be difficult to start if the choke procedures are not followed to the letter.
If the engine still doesn’t start, then it is almost always lack of spark or a fuel system problem. You can check the spark by pulling the plug wire and holding it 3/8″ from any metal surface on the engine. When the engine is turned, the spark should jump the gap if the ignition is working. If the engine has spark, then it is probably due to not getting enough or getting too much fuel. If your not a mechanic it is probably time to take it in for service.
Many areas have ethanol added to the gasoline at least part of the year. Many small engines are NOT designed to run with ethanol. Ethanol can dissolve some parts in particular rubber and some gaskets. This can create problems since leak can spring in the fuel system. Also, if ethanol sits for long periods of time, it will separate and sit on the bottom of the fuel tank and carburator. There is a bacteria that loves ethanol and in the process of digesting the ethanol, it produces a powerful acid that will damage most fuel systems. That acid is can literally eat through metal parts. It is advisable to drain the gas from the engine if your not planning to use it in the next couple of weeks."

2fe7ecad,Does having a thicker blood cause a stroke?,"Thickness in terms of viscosity, yes. Viscosity is defined as the state of being thick, sticky, and semifluid in consistency, due to internal friction. Proteins and blood cells increase blood viscosity, and the amount of viscosity in blood is usually a good indication of high levels of plasma proteins, often a sign of inflammation present in the body or a reflection of the amount of paraproteins (monoclonal immunoglobulins or antibodies) in blood. At blood glucose level of > 90 mg/dL blood becomes highly viscous whether in diabetic patients or in normal subjects.
Thickness due to viscosity is unlike thickness due to density in that with density significant bonding is between the constituent molecules of a substance but with viscosity there is a much stronger interaction between the molecules in a substance and those of the container itself at their common interface. Density is defined as the degree of compactness of a substance.
It is important to differentiate the two types of thickness because they influence flow dynamics very differently. Viscosity increases resistance to blood flow, raises blood pressure and provokes turbulent flow of blood that can disrupt plaques and lead to strokes and heart attacks. But dense liquids like mercury flow with less resistance and less turbulence.
Dehydration decreases the amount of water that shields the free reactive groups in biomolecules including proteins and glucose that make them viscous and so low concentrations of these biochemical substances do not pose any significant viscosity threat as higher concentrations will do. Body cells are just a cluster of ‘sticky’ biomolecules, and an increase in the red blood or white blood cell count will raise the viscosity of blood, increase drag and blood pressure and may provoke a stroke or heart attack.

8db14110,How can a stroke cause anger?,"How can a stroke cause anger? It doesn’t directly but indirectly does due to “cause and effect”. Different parts of the brain control different functions within the body, including how we feel. If the brain that controls emotions becomes damaged by a stroke, the result can be anything to how you think, feel, or behave. No stroke is the same in all. It has to do with the part of brain affected and how much damaged has occurred. And it is different from person to person. Strokes are a traumatic life experience to anyone. Strokes may represent a “change of life” experience as well. Some stroke “victims” can never come to terms with the change of life that a stroke can bring to a person. As no two strokes are the same, the emotions effected also aren’t the same, that is with one exception. “Depression!” Depression is the most common emotion for any stroke victim. And what is the most commond response to depression? Anger!"
fea00104,Is it common for people to have strokes or heart attacks while using the toilet or taking a shower? What activities are people most commonly doing when they have strokes? I'd think exertion of defecating or standing in a hot shower could cause it.,"I’m not sure abut the hot shower thing, but I did once read that you shouldn’t let the water stream hit your neck. The danger of stroke or heart attack while defecating is real. When constipated, people often “push”, just the same as a mother does during labor. This causes a tensing of the diaphragm, known as the Valsalva maneuver. It raises blood pressure, sometimes to a dangerous level that can cause strokes or heart attacks, usually in people with conditions that weaken the heart or blood vessels.
The Valsalva maneuver is often used to unplug ears while flying or diving, during weightlifting and even to counteract certain conditions like tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), though it can actually cause atrial fibrillation (Afib).
Instead of “pushing” by using the Valsalva, try exhaling slowly or panting, the way women are told to do during childbirth when it isn’t advisable to push. This keeps blood pressure at a normal level.
Here is some more information:

Heart attacks(MI), and strokes(CVA) have the same common denominator-clots. Obviously it takes a much larger clot to stop your heart , but the blood vessels in the brain are in some cases microscopic, so the clot itself can be microscopic. Every single one of us, male or female, young or old, have millions/billions of clots circulating through our bloodstream daily. It's the presence of blood vessel clogging culprits like plaque, fibrosis,traumatic injury, that allow these clots to get stuck, thus impeding blood flow. Our blood carries oxygen, and without the supply of oxygen, the affected area of any and all of the systems in our body;integumentary , cardiovascular, nervous, respiratory, etc…begin to die fairly immediately. It seems a fairly normal practice to describe these debilitating events to a fairly young person as being rare or even crazy and unfair, but that is largely because people equivocate serious illness and disease to advanced age. Disease, impairment, injury, and disability don't age-discriminate."
82cf3115,How does smoking cause a heart attack? Is it similar to how smoking causes a stroke?,"Coronary Heart Diseaseoccurs when arteries that carry blood to the heart muscle are narrowed by plaque or blocked by clots. Chemicals in cigarette smoke cause the blood to thicken and form clots inside veins and arteries. Blockage from a clot can lead to a heart attack and sudden death.
But when you breathe in cigarette smoke, the blood that is distributed to the rest of the body becomes contaminated with the smoke's chemicals. These chemicals can damage to your heart and blood vessels,1 which can lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD)—the leading cause of all deaths in the United States.
When you breathe in air from the atmosphere, the lungs take in oxygen and deliver it to the heart, which pumps this oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body through the blood vessels. But when you breathe in cigarette smoke, the blood that is distributed to the rest of the body becomes contaminated with the smoke’s chemicals. These chemicals can damage to your heart and blood vessels,1
which can lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD)—the leading cause of all deaths in the United States.2
CVD is a generic term referring to multiple conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels3
. Some of these conditions include:
coronary heart disease
hypertension (high blood pressure)
heart attack
stroke
aneurysms
peripheral artery disease1,2
In addition to permanently damaging your heart and blood vessels, cigarette smoke can also cause CVD by changing your blood chemistry1,2
and causing plaque—a waxy substance comprised of cholesterol, scar tissue, calcium, fat, and other material3
—to build up in the arteries, the major blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body. This plaque buildup can lead to a disease called atherosclerosis.
When the chemicals in cigarette smoke cause atherosclerosis and thickened blood in the arteries, it becomes more difficult for blood cells to move through arteries and other blood vessels to get to vital organs like the heart and brain.4
This can create blood clots and ultimately lead to a heart attack or stroke, even death.1,2
Other rare but serious cardiovascular conditions that can be caused by smoking include…
Peripheral Artery Disease (and peripheral vascular disease): A condition in which the narrowing of blood vessels results in insufficient blood flow to arms, legs, hands, and feet. Smoking is the leading preventable cause of this condition, which can result in amputation.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm: A bulge that is formed in an area of the aorta—the main artery that distributes blood through the body—that sits in the abdomen. When an abdominal aortic aneurysm bursts, it can result in sudden death. More women than men die from aortic aneurysms, and nearly all deaths from this condition are caused by smoking.

1cc39d71,"Can a heat stroke cause protein denaturation inside your body? If so, what would happen to somebody in this condition?","Heat strokes typically occur at core temperatures well above 104.5F. Proteins, some at least, begin to denature at 106F. Heat stroke puts tremendous stress on the body which is unable to cool itself. With a higher temperature, metabolic demand climbs markedly. Thus, death by heat stroke is usually due to inability to meet metabolic demand, especially with dehydration, resulting in multisystem/multiorgan collapse. Classic heat stroke onset occurs over hours to days except if exercise induced. Point is that despite the presence of some tissue damage markers (rhabdomyolysis) the severe stress on the body usually leads to system collapse before death by protein denaturation."

f7046cd3,What do you think will be the media's reaction now that Capitol Hill police officer Brian Sicknick's death has been revealed to be natural causes due to a series of strokes?,"I don't have to guess because I'm reading the actual articles. They're all reporting pretty much the same things, so far, including some details of the exam and its findings. I predict that there will be some discussion of it in the media and more details as to the legal and medical aspects of this and similar cases.
The thing is, natural causes doesn't make the rioters and especially the men on video assaulting Officer Sicknick heroes or even innocent. They still assaulted him and sprayed him in the face with bear spray and instigated a dangerous and stressful ordeal. Hours later he collapsed and died of 2 strokes the next day. But the bear spray apparently did not directly cause his death through injury.
Those men are very fortunate because they most likely won't be charged with murder. They're fortunate that the examiners took the time and did a very detailed examination. They're also fortunate that the officer died at the hospital and not on the spot. Because if someone dies during a felony, even of natural causes like a heart attack, the perpetrators can be charged with murder.
Death by natural causes doesn't always mean that the victim was destined to die at that moment, regardless of the circumstances. It's a lot more complex than that. Events can bring on a stroke or heart attack or an asthma attack in someone predisposed to it."

c3185dae,What causes a stroke on the left side of the brain?,"I don’t think the cause of the stroke determines which side of the brain the stroke affects.
What matters is the location of the blood vessel that was blocked (in the case of an ischemic stroke) or that burst (in the case of a hemorrhagic stroke)."
9a3d155c,"Ultimately, is the sole cause of an ischaemic stroke, a blood clot?","Ultimately, a stroke is when part of the brain is injured due to reduced perfusion.
An ischemic stroke happens when a part of the brain doesn't receive the blood that it needs because of a blockage in any one of the blood vessels that allow blood flow.
Any part of the body that doesn’t receive oxygen gets injured and begins die. This is called ischemia.
A blockage in blood vessels usually happens when it “clogs”. The blood vessels to the brain are like pipes that carry water. Layers of mold and “gunk” can build up over many years. The same kind of build up can happen in a person’s arteries. Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood FROM the heart TO the brain. Similar to the mold or “gunk” that clogs the pipes, there is fat that clogs the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. As the blood flow slows, it eventually clots and stops any more blood from getting to the brain.
In some cases, arteries near the heart, chest or neck can have clots that break loose and move with the blood flow. When a clot breaks loose, it is called an embolism, and it can clog the arteries and block blood from getting to the brain.
A hemorrhagic stroke happens when one of the blood vessels in the brain cracks open and leaks blood in the brain. This is like when blood vessels break under the skin and there is bruising. Because the brain is such a sensitive organ, bleeding in the brain is much more serious and life threatening than bleeding under our skin. When this happens, the part of the brain that doesn't receive oxygen will get injured and begin to die."

From Elevated risk of

When considered as separate outcomes, hospitalization rates for hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke were both markedly elevated for subjects treated with dialysis (ischemic, RR = 4.3 to 10.1; hemorrhagic, RR = 4.1 to 6.7).
Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have markedly advanced vascular disease when compared to the general population[1-12]
. In particular, several authors have reported more severe atherosclerotic disease of the carotid arteries among ESRD patients than in subjects with normal renal function[3, 6-8, 12]
. This accelerated disease of the cerebral vasculature could increase the risk of ischemic stroke in these patients. Additionally, ESRD is associated with hypertension, a bleeding diathesis, and the routine administration of heparin during hemodialysis, which could increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke."

The last one I heard was of an 88 year old man with a long history of heart problems who consumed an entire 800 mg THC lollipop (standard dose is 5 mg) and suffered a heart attack. I believe it was his 5th one or something.
Tachycardia, or an increased heart rate, is a very frequent side effect of marijuana consumption for first-time users. This increase in heart rate is roughly equivalent to a 15 minute cardio workout. Once tolerance develops, tachycardia is one of the first side effects to go away. A consumer’s heart rate will slow down significantly after 1 hour, and returns to normal within 2 hours. Although no one has ever died from cannabis consumption, heart attacks included, patients with heart conditions should still monitor their heart rates carefully if they decide to consume marijuana.
It’s not something the average person needs to worry about at all. Consumers with debilitating heart conditions should consult their doctor before consuming any form of cannabis."

Most poisons will have gastrointestinal symptoms and typically would cause the first symptoms in hours. If you can let the stroke like symptoms try the Cortinarius orellanus mushroom. This will destroy the kidneys and will cause natural looking death after a couple of weeks. Another good tip is dimethil mercury. That will cause death after several weeks with neurological symptoms that can easily mistaken with stroke in the 16 century. However there is no way that you can handle the material in the 16th century in a safe way. So you will also die but if this not an issue go for it.

Unfair to blame poor old pizza. All bread items equally add carbs, and as such are connected to heart disease. that however is not strokes. There is evidence to suggest that glycated ApoB protein is involved, and bread supplies tons of glucose to the blood.
So you maybe have a link with grains and leaky gut causing inflamation, or with an imballance of omega 6 over omega 3 promoting more inflamatory end products, so maybe link more to which seed oil you use, not to the olive oil with pizzas."

A large income drop in itself is a massively stressful situation that some physicians believe can cause a myocardial or cerebral event just from the sheer stress.
Looking past that, having low income, as a stereotype, makes people think of living on a poor diet such as mcdonalds meals or eating food from tins instead of fruit and vegetables and a balanced home cooked meal due to lack of affordability. People also peg low income households as less likely to go out and socialise which can impact mental health or exercise regularly and use gyms which impacts physiological health.

Unless he was chronically hyperventilating, subjectively feeling breathless and inappropriately breathing too deeply too fast, don’t know it this can be the result of his mini stroke, his neurologist should look into this, hyperventilation is easily diagnosed by having his blood gasses done. Hyperventilation also causes dizziness, and often a prickly feeling in hands and feet and around the mouth. We often see it in anxious nervous panicky people, often as a symptoms a panic attacks.

Do path strokes appear similar to these examples above? If yes you need to look at Stroke dialog box in Illustrator.

Select a path. Examine the stroke dialog box. Be sure the show option is on for the stroke dialog box. (little icon of three lines in right upper corner)
If dashed line is checked, uncheck it and see what happens to the selected path.
The next dialog box to examine is the Appearance, use the menu (little icon of three lines in right upper corner) in this dialog box and scroll to clear appearance. Observe what happens to selected path.
Remember you have to select it to effect it.
If those do not change path “stokes not completely solid” issue. View the path in outline mode, make sure it is a one segment path and not many small path segments.
If none of these suggestions work, maybe another will have answer."

9329a10d,Does increasing the stroke of the engine change compression?,"Realize that unless you have a “really weird” engine to start with, it’s not possible to change ONLY the stroke length without also having to change other parts. For instance: if you lengthen stroke without also changing either the connecting rod length or the piston compression height (distance from the wrist pin centerline to the top of the piston) - or both, the longer stroke is going to cause the top of the piston to travel higher in the cylinder bore than it did before. Really bad things (as in “crossing the streams bad”) happen when a piston crashes into the bottom of the cylinder head and/or valves, so either you have to move those parts farther away from the piston tops or you have to ‘shorten’ the overall length of the piston/rod assembly. Compression ratio is nothing more than the ratio of the maximum volume (piston at bottom dead center- BDC) to the minimum cylinder volume (piston at top dead center - TDC) including the volume in the combustion chamber, head gasket opening, any valve reliefs in the pistons, etc. A longer stroke makes the maximum volume larger. If you shorten the piston/rod assembly so that it still fits into the cylinder at TDC without crashing into things, then assuming that the minimum volume is still near what it was before (piston height in the bore is the same as before) then viola - more compression because of the ratio. If you solved the interference problem by moving the fixed parts farther away (by using much thicker head gaskets for example) then resultant compression still depends on that ratio of max volume to min volume."
039ff0b8,How do I care for my husband who is 57 but a stroke left him functioning at about a 12-year old level.,"Hmmm... I am guessing here that you concern is not so much related to what he thinks about but instead related to his behavior. If not, why would you care if his thoughts are somewhat childish?
So, my recommendation is to confront the behavior you find is improper or irritating in a respectful manner. Don't attack his character. Instead appeal to that part of him that is a man.
Another thought is that his behavior might be, in part, a reaction to your treatment of him. I know that it is not uncommon for a wife to treat her husband as if she were his mother. I think it is somewhat understandable for moms who are in that parenting mode much of the day. But you are not his mom. I'm not saying this is you issue, but if the shoe fits wear it.
I am speaking to you about what you can do, so it may sound like I am taking his side. I'm not - I think it is highly likely that his behavior at times seems childish (mine does, too, at times). But he didn't ask me for advice.
One final thought. I highly recommend a book by Emmerson Eggerichs titled, ""Love and Respect"". You might find it really helpful. It is good at explaining some basic differences about how men and women think and it contains many useful suggestions for how both of you can improve your marriage.
Good luck and may God bless!"

bc0aaa87,What should happen with the White House if the president had a stroke leaving him unable to speak and function?,"This situation would, most likely, result in the implementation of Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution. Per the terms of this section, if both the Vice President and a majority of the members of the president’s cabinet believe that the President of the United States is incapacitated (be it physically, mentally, or any other situation that they believe renders the president unable to do his or her job), they must notify the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate that the president is incapacitated. As soon as they do that, the president is relieved of duty (but not removed from office) and the vice president becomes Acting President of the United States.
Once the disability (whatever it is) no longer exists (let’s assume the president goes through rehab as well as physical and occupational therapy to the point that he or she feels ready to go back to work), the president would then notify the Speaker and President pro tempore of his or her intention to resume the powers and duties of the presidency. Should the vp and cabinet not agree with the president that he or she is now functional, they would so notify the Speaker and President pro tempore within four days of the president’s declaration of fitness, at which time Congress would have to decide the situation. If both houses of Congress vote by a 2/3 majority that the president is still incapacitated, the VP remains Acting President.
This type of scenario has never been implemented since it was written into the US Constitution in 1967. Many scholars and historians (myself included) are of the conclusion that it should have been used in March, 1981 after Ronald Reagan was shot. However, Vice President George HW Bush was out of Washington at the time, and by the time he returned to DC, Reagan was already out of surgery with a strong prognosis, so Bush decided not to ask the cabinet to invoke this procedure.
As a piece of added info, Section 3 of the same amendment provides for a president voluntarily surrendering power to the VP by using the same notification procedure, if he or she knows a disability exists or is going to exist. This part has been used three times—once by Reagan in 1985 when he was having surgery, and twice by George W Bush (in 2002 and 2007, I think) when he was undergoing routine medical testing that required sedation for an hour or so."

To confirm it use engine combustion leak test kit. It looks for carbon dioxide/Carbon monoxide in the headspace of the radiator and, if detected, reveals that combustion gases are getting into the coolant.
So it also means water is getting into the combustion chamber which is making the exhaust gases turn white.
The just pour fluid from the kit into clever rubber cone, it should fit most radiator openings and use the aspirator bulb to pull the radiator air thru the fluid if fluid changes colour then exhaust gases are present in the cooling system.

Race relations have been influenced by bad college theories that under most recent (and worst) iteration came about in the late 90s to early 2000s. These theories were fed to society heavily by about 2010. I explain them in the below. I’ve been fighting these theories for 20 years.
Rudolph Jensen's answer to What is wrong with saying ‘all lives matter’?
These theories linked below this paragraph are sexist and racist. They are leading to massive problems when applied to society that we are seeing right now. Of course, the “woke” crowd doesn’t see it that way. The theories divide people into groups based on race, sex, sexual orientation, and gender then perpetually treat those groups differently. Some are grouped into perpetual oppressors and others perpetual victims. Racism is discriminating against different races based on color of skin. Racism is dynamic and not fixed to a simplistic narrative. Academia has a LOT of power and they teach these theories to others. Those people once taught go into journalism, teaching, activist groups, and politics. Virtue signaling and getting special victim status is intoxicating as it’s a “feel good” narrative and gives power to those pushing the narrative. This type of victimology lead to authoritarianism and hundreds of millions of deaths in the 20th century through Communism and Fascism. You’d think humans would learn but alas they often don’t want to think critically. The number one problem and threat in the Western World now is adherence to these theories.

Some quotes from Dr. Thomas Sowell - Wikipedia
“Virtually no idea is too ridiculous to be accepted, even by very intelligent and highly educated people, if it provides a way for them to feel special and important. Some confuse that feeling with idealism.”
― Thomas Sowell
“Some of the biggest cases of mistaken identity are among intellectuals who have trouble remembering that they are not God.”
― Thomas Sowell
“Intellectuals may like to think of themselves as people who ""speak truth to power"" but too often they are people who speak lies to gain power.”
― Thomas Sowell
“It is amazing how many people think that they can answer an argument by attributing bad motives to those who disagree with them. Using this kind of reasoning, you can believe or not believe anything about anything, without having to bother to deal with facts or logic.”
― Thomas Sowell
“One of the painful signs of years of dumbed-down education is how many people are unable to make a coherent argument. They can vent their emotions, question other people's motives, make bold assertions, repeat slogans-- anything except reason.”
― Thomas Sowell
“What socialism
, fascism and other ideologies of the left have in common is an assumption that some very wise people—like themselves—need to take decisions out of the hands of lesser people, like the rest of us, and impose those decisions by government fiat.”
― Thomas Sowell
Do we really want children learning what’s shown in the video below? They are teaching “woke” theories in many schools across the country now. I learned about them in college.
I am not pushing a narrative but rather I’m appealing to the reader to think critically about the narratives pushed upon society. Do not fall for “feel good” ideas with no substance.

Relative efficiency of pigment and horny layer thickness in protecting the skin of Europeans and Africans against solar ultraviolet radiation
*
M. L. Thomson
Basically this study found that dark skin people are not only darker, but their skin is hotter, however melanin disperses the heat, which also prevents burns. Dark skin (in this case SubSaharan Africans) can absorb nearly 36% more solar radiation than indigenous Europeans (on average)…obviously all African and all Europeans are not of the same skin color. This absorption of greater heat, they found to increase the quickness at which Africans began to sweat compared to Europeans, which helped cool them faster.
Back in the 1950’s some people thought black people just had “thicker skin” and therefore this gave them more immunity to sunlight than Europeans. However , that was found not to matter. It was melanin. Melanin disperses solar radiation, stopping it from damaging the skin tissues, this is found to more than compensate for the fact it actually absorbs more solar radiation.
This is actually counter intuitive…I suppose. White people burn although their skin is more reflective. Black people have far less reflective skin, but the thing that makes the skin less reflective is also what protects it from solar radiation…amazing!"

A stroke is an infarction of brain tissue killing it in the center of the tissue and leaving a margin around the death of semi living tissue. Strokes have different causes. Ischemic , lack of oxygen , or embolic, also lack of oxygen but caused by a small clot that flew into the brain artery and blocked blood flow. Tumors and foreign bodies can cause blockages as well.
If this blockage lasts more than about 15 minutes it it pretty certain that part of the brain tissue will die. Dead brain means loss of the nerves in that part of the brain.
How long does this blockage last ?
Does the part of the brain have some rapid alternative blood supply?
Will the clot dissolve before it kills brain tissue and restores some blood supply. ?
What happens to dead brain tissue ?
A Reversible Ischemic neurological deficit (RIND, or TIA,). Has usually meant that neurological loss is temporary and has mostly recovered to normal within 24 hours. ( this may be old school speak ).
A completed Stroke is a neurological deficit that lasts more than 24 hours. It may change and improve a bit but it leaves residual neurological loss .
Hemorrhagic stroke can be several things.
The dead tissue bleeds into itself or expands and hurts other tissue
The small brain artery actually bursts and blood into brain tissue that expands and puts pressure on normal brain tissue. This is often because of a brain aneurism. ( like a small defect in the Artery that forms a balloon in the vessel and it bursts )"

But re your episodes, I really think you should visit the hospital, if in case you had a ministroke, your chances of having a real stroke is really big, and boy, you'd want to avoid that in way possible. I believe from what I was told, an MRI or CT scan would reveal past strokes, even mini ones... i hope you have yourself checked."
5ad9c2c0,"If they say that there is no blood flowing throughout the brain, then how about a stroke or a TIA (transient ischemic attack)?","I’m not sure what you are asking with this question, but I will try to answer, based on what I assume you are getting at.
The condition of “no blood flowing throughout the brain” is what one would see in the case of cardiac arrest, where the heart stops pumping. That would cause severe brain damage within a few minutes, if blood flow were not restored. The brain depends on the circulation for a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen.
In the case of stroke or TIA, blood flow is reduced, but only to a part of the brain, not the brain as a whole. It need not necessarily be reduced to zero to cause symptoms.
Normally, cerebral blood flow is maintained at ~50 mL per 100 g of brain tissue per minute. A fall to 30 ml/100g/min would very likely cause symptoms.
The body puts a premium on maintaining a constant blood flow to the brain via the process called autoregulation. If you are interested in learning more about this, here is a link to get you started.

f3b25617,Why are Transient Ischemic Attacks precursors to full blown strokes?,
8b20b461,What is the average lenghth of time between suffering an Transient Ischemic Stroke and the occurence of a major stroke?,"A TIA often precedes a major ischemic stroke by a month or less. Prompt assessment of a TIA and following medical recommendations may prevent further problems.
My radiologist found signs that I’d suffered TIA’s that I wasn’t aware of in his assessment of the CT I had when I first arrived with a major stroke. I wish I’d noticed and paid attention.
Strokes leave permanent damage and recovery is very difficult. It has been almost three years of hard work and I’m still recovering. Everyone remarks on my “remarkable” recovery, but I’m still clumsy, off balance and I fall far too often.
If you have a TIA, pay attention!"
eb165089,What is Transient Global Amnesia and does it imitate a stroke?,
b0022269,What is the difference between a stroke and a transient ischemic attack?,"A transient ischemic attack has the same origins as that of an ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke. In an ischemic stroke, a clot blocks the blood supply to part of your brain. In a transient ischemic attack, unlike a stroke, the blockage is brief, and there is no permanent damage."
b16424cc,Which is a modifiable risk factor for transient ischemic attacks and ischemi strokes?,
6cb88df0,"Can mini-stroke/transient ischemic attack last minutes and cause numbness in both hands? I had darkness in vision, numbness and tingling in 2 hands, was sweating. Blood pressure was low. This happened on 1 day of my period and accompanied cramps.","While missing a lot of info this certainly doesn’t sound like a TIA.
Most likely scenario is the following. Abdominal cramping can trigger what’s known as a cardioinhibitory or vasovagal reflex, initially slowing heart rate and lowering blood pressure. I’m not sure what you mean by darkened vision. but this could be from low blood pressure.
As the body tries to react to this decrease in blood pressure it releases catecholamines and other substances that increase the blood pressure but also cause sweating, hyperventilation (rapid breathing) and anxiety.
The symmetric hand numbness is characteristic of hyperventilation induced hypocalcemia, where the low CO2 in the body drives calcium into cells which in produce this symptom called parestheshia.
Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), nausea and dehydration could cause a similar picture.
None of this should be taken as medical advice - I don’t know nearly enough of your medical history to rule out something more sinister - would see a doctor if you are concerned."
bd6f072d,What is the difference between a stroke and TIA?,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke, occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is blocked for just a short while, but long enough to produce ischemia and cause some reversible brain dysfunction. Low brain oxygen and nutrients mean that the affected brain part begins to lose function.
The blockade gets lifted sooner than later and the affected part of the brain resumes its function. This can happen when a clot dissolves to allow a reflow of blood to the affected brain part. The body has its natural enzyme called plasmin that breaks down fibrin in the clot.
In a stroke, however, the blockade is not temporary but persists and the ensuing prolonged ischemia causes an irreversible damage, resulting in the death of the affected tissue or an infarct. If clot dissolves when severe damage has already been done, the reflow of blood, on the contrary, will have a catastrophic effect, instead. Calcium overload leads to free radical production and this facilitates cell death."
e3794295,What causes heat stroke?,"Heat Stroke is a term too loosely used. Properly defined it is a stroke caused by the heat. So this means brain tissue actually dies (often the patient does as well).
So what causes it? Heat. Too much heat. The body has several mechanisms to cope with heat;
number 1 is avoidance- So we move out of the sun into the shade. Jump into a pool or shower, A/C on, hat, fan. What if you can’t? You are an infant in a car, prisoner in a cell, passed out due to drugs or alcohol, alzheimers patient, bed ridden nursing home patient. Well then the temp of your brain raises. Once it gets in the 104–5 range it starts to die and unless someone intervenes so do you
number 2 is sweating. So on a hot day you swet. You swet a lot. Swetting keeps the body temperature down however only until you run out of swet. Then you develope heat exhaustion and you either faint or revert to #1 avoidance.
number 3 is vasodilation. You blood is shunted to the skin and the skin blood vessels dilate. So the skin becomes a large radiator. It helps but if the sun is beating down on the skin or there is not enough fluid in the system then well it can’t improve things."
4381d63e,What time of day do most strokes occur?,
9d50dfa2,How does a brain stroke happen?,To put it as simply as possible there are two types of stroke namely ischemic and haemorrhagic...any factor that causes decreased blood supply to a particular area of the brain leads to ischemic stroke and symptoms pertaining to that particular region of the brain..any factor that increases the pressure of the blood flow through a particular vessel in the brain leads to rupture of the small vessel and causes haemorrhagic stroke...ischemic stroke most commonly caused due to an emboli blocking an end artery...while haemorrhagic stroke is most commonly caused due to uncontrolled hypertension..
d2664046,At what age do most strokes occur?,"Strokes affect people of all ages, including foetuses.

07cc6016,Can you get a stroke from having aortic valve disease?,"Yes but that depends on what sort of aortic arch “disease” your talking about. If it’s a congenital coarctation malformation,Aortic stenosis, aneurism or aortic stricture it can cause areas of restricted or pooled blood flow. Technically yes anytime you slow dwell time in blood vessels tiny emboli can develop. In the case of the Aorta it can cause emboli to get thrown up the carotid artery and cause strokes (Aka emboli or embolic showers) in the brain. Often if this is discovered it’s highly recommended to take long term anticoagulants. Surgery or minimal invasive procedures are often recommended.
I want to stress that although concerning, this kind of disease can be well monitored managed and followed up on. You may need to see one or more specialists. Find a good health provider doctor,nurse practitioner or physicians assistant and start with a full health physical H&P (history and physical exam) People can live long relatively healthy lives with Aortic arch problems."
a3512764,Can a hemorrhagic stroke occur to teenagers?,"Haemorragic stroke can occur at any age.
The most common cause of intracerebral haemorrage is hypertension. This is usually seen in adults who have hypertension. The haemorrage is usually in the putamen or Thalamus. Teenagers also can have hypertension due to secondary causes like renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease etc which can make teenagers prone for hypertensive bleeds rarely.
Teenagers are more likely to develop haemorragic strokes due to conditions like aneurisms, arterio venous malformations, cavernomas, coagulation disorders like hemophilia, low platelet counts, subarachnoid Haemorrage, haemorrage into a tumor or an infarct, use of anticoagulants etc..
The epidemic of abuse of the so-called 'designer drugs' amphetamine, cocaine and ecstasy is fast replacing traditional aetiological factors as the largest cause of intracerebral haemorrhage among young adults. Traditional teaching is that these represent hypertensive haemorrhages. Recent reports, however, have indicated that these patients may harbour underlying vascular malformations."
e41e454a,How do Strokes occur and how do they effect the human brain and body?,"The term “stroke” when referring to the brain describes two very different scenarios: the most common (maybe 90%) of strokes are caused by an embolism, a blood clot in an artery feeding the brain which slows or entirely stops blood flow in that artery, killing the brain structure dependent on that blood flow. The other kind of “stroke”, much less common (about 10%) is called an aneurysm (which can occur anywhere in the body) or a brain bleed. There are two kinds of aneurysms: the blood vessel has a weakness in the wall that causes it to balloon outward until it breaks, flooding the brain with blood, and a collapse inward that causes a tear in the blood vessel, same result, blood flooding the interstitial spaces of the brain and insufficient blood flow to the brain structure through normal delivery channels, so that brain structure suffers cell death.
Because an embolism induced brain stroke and a brain aneurysm stroke can have the same symptoms (at first), it is a risk to inject the chemical that dissolves blood clots because it can make a brain bleed even worse.
A stroke can be so mild you don’t even notice it, until they keep occurring and finally symptoms appear. Depending on where it occurs, there are a great variety of symptoms, you can look them up."
52d2481e,Does a stroke occur due to immense thinking?,"No.

General anatomy: The brain vasculature is composed of the anterior circulation (up your neck via the internal carotid from aorta that branches to form the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral) and the posterior circulation (from two vertebral arteries that form the basilar artery, which eventually gives rise to the posterior cerebral arteries). The anterior and posterior circulations are connected via the posterior communicating arteries.
There are also two major types of strokes: ischemic (85%) and hemorrhagic (15%). The major risk factors of ischemic stroke are smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation (heart arrhythmia). There are three main subtypes of ischemic stroke too (thrombosis, embolism, and hypoperfusion).
For simplicity's sake to answer your question, I'll stick to the most common arteries to get an embolic stroke. The most common arteries to get blocked off by an embolus is the middle cerebral (~75%) followed by somewhere along the posterior circulation (~20%) and then the anterior circulation (~5%)."

e8e25bda,How does a suction stroke occur in an IC engine? What causes it to occur?,"Either it is attained by using electric motors or like the conventional method by kick start. Later is continued due to momentum within crank.
The pressure difference is required to make it happen. Suction stroke of the piston begins at top dead center (T.D.C.) and ends at bottom dead center (B.D.C.). In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing vacuum pressure into the cylinder through its downward motion. The piston is moving down as air is being sucked in by the downward motion against the piston. When the piston starts going downward the volume starts increasing resulting in decrease of pressure inside engine cylinder so the movement of air-fuel mixture is from high pressure to low pressure, so it starts suction of air-fuel mixture inside engine cylinder."

With fMRI? Not sure fMRI is the best tool for a “real-time” picture of stroke. fMRI is based on the BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) signal, which is affected by a number of physiological parameters — and an acute stroke would affect all of those parameters. So you would certainly see a change in the BOLD signal due to the reduction in blood flow, but that would just be a part of the signal. Every other physiological parameter that’s tied up in the BOLD signal would also be affected, which would make interpretation particularly difficult.

In some cases, it’s obvious what caused a stroke: if somebody’s obese, has really high blood pressure, is really old, etc., it’s pretty clear-cut.
But I was 115 pounds, 90/60, and 24 years old when I had my stroke. My doctors looked at me, referred me to a cardiologist for another test, which was negative, and told me to go on my way. “The chance of you having a subsequent stroke is very small,” they assured me.
Six months later, I was back in the hospital with another one. =(
About six months after THAT, I was able to peer out from beneath my lead jacket of fatigue and pick my head up enough to wonder WHY I’d had a second one. It’d be nice to figure it out, I wagered, to prevent a third one. At that point, I’d already decided that if I had another one, JUST LET ME DIE.
My speech therapist referred me to a neurologist at the big city hospital nearby. In retrospect, he was nuts, but he did decide to perform a test just to check for certain that the cardiologist I’d originally seen hadn’t missed anything. (The first test, a TEE — trans esophageal echocardiogram — checked for a hole in my heart by sticking a camera down my throat look to look at my heart. The second test, a TCD — transcranial doppler — shot minuscule bubbles into my arm via an IV and listened to my brain to see if any of them made it up there.) Lo and behold, it dinged! I had a hole in my heart that allowed bubbles/clots/etc to pass through a ventricle and into my brain.
But, a week later, the neurologist called and said he wasn’t sure that the hole was the cause of my stroked. He explained that doctors usually require both a hole and a hypercoagulable disease — i.e. you need a hole in your heart and a reason to have a clot. “Why the h*ll did you have me do this test, then?” I wanted to shout.
To make a long story short, I decided to go ahead and have surgery to close the hole. It’s not terribly risky, but it is heart surgery. I haven’t had another stroke in 12 years, I’ve had a very good neurologist tell me that clots sometimes form in the area right around the hole *just because*, I’ve had doctors tell me to get my head screwed on straight — everybody knows a hole isnt enough without a hypercoagulable disease … I’ve pretty much just given up having any chance of ever knowing what caused my strokes.
So please, figure it out! LOL"
743822c2,"Will a brain MRI reveal past strokes? If a stroke robust enough not to be considered a TIA were to occur, would it be visible in an MRI years later?","I had a stroke, grand mal seizure which broke my back (L1 and L2) on 10/10/10….not a good day.
Multiple CAT scans and MRI’s showed “moderate brain damage” from “prior strokes”. I had no knowledge of the prior strokes, but my Neurologist showed me the scans and said…”see all that white area….that’s damaged brain cells”….and there was a lot of white. I had a contrast MRI done which showed “recent” damage, based, I was told, on the amount of contrast that was taken up. Oddly, it was not as large as the original damage, but specifically located in the occipital region. This made sense since my stroke caused strange and scary visual disturbances.
I was able to walk out of the hospital the next day, with aphasia, but otherwise seemingly OK. I asked the neurologist if I would be getting therapy for cognitive issues and he said “but you show no cognitive deficit”. In my addlebrained state, I accepted it…but I knew I was not the same.
And here is the important part to people who may have had a stroke. Since only I seemed to be concerned about damage and it was not too apparent to others, I knew that I had to handle my recovery on my own (now I know I should have pushed to get professional help at that time, but I was not thinking clearly).
I decided that I would meditate, play word games and play the guitar every day, since I had read that they help. Every day for about a year I spent 3–4 hours doing both and I am totally convinced that I am 98% recovered due to those efforts. I found Silva Systems tapes to be particularly soothing and helpful to my recovery.
Today, nearly 7 years later most people can observe nothing that would be indicative of a stroke. I’ve developed “coping” mechanisms like double checking everything I write since I can no longer recognize homonyms (some results are humorous), I ask people “have I told you this before” and the answer is “yes” often, so I don’t repeat it. But I have no memory of having said it.
I now also take about every “brain” supplement there is and I do find that some make a difference.
So my prior strokes, (and perhaps recent ones) are not apparent to me, but they are visible on MRI’s. But I believe that, in my case at least, that there are positive outcomes from a difficult situation."
8613ba6e,"In a four-stroke cycle, does the minimum temperature inside the engine cylinder occur at the beginning of the suction stroke or the end of the suction stroke?","Because you have your intake cycle immediately after your combustion cycle, the cylinder head (internal) and valves are hotter now than at any other moment after the ignition flash.
The piston has just pushed out the hot exhaust gasses, which although less hot than the initial flaming of the air fuel mix are leaving a lot of their heat in the wall and head of the chamber, your engine is now, at inlet valve opening, sucking in “cold” air fuel mix, which has an immediate cooling effect on both the cylinder head and the cylinder wall, and also the piston head. Luckily it does, other wise your engine would melt.
At the Begining of the suction stroke, everything is hot, the air fuel mix comes in but has a lot of work to do cooling everything down. By the time it has sucked in a whole cylinder of air, the chamber cylinder temperature will be at its lowest point at the bottom of the cycle, the air fuel mix has been progressivly absorbing the heat as it comes in, as it does so, it expands, filling the cylinder more quickly than is desireable and resisting the in coming air fuel mix. So you will find that despite the suction of the piston as it descends, it is not getting a uniform amount of air coming in throughout the cycle.
In a badly set up engine, or one that is suffering from hot cylinders, you might even get the air fuel mixture to auto ignite, causing a “backfire” (more than one reason for backfires)
So, I’m pretty confident that you can take the moment of least temperature in the cylinder as being at bottom dead centre, where the air fuel mix has absorbed all of the heat energy from the cylinder that it can.
This is not a good thing for the efficiency of the engine, but a good thing for its cooling.
Thanks for the asking."
9ea67eeb,What causes repeated TIA strokes? Are there any symptoms that occur ahead of a TIA?,"TIA = transient ischaemic attack, brief neurological symptoms that resolve fully (Scan shows no recent abnormality)
Stroke = symptoms don’t fully resolve within 24 hours (Scan shows recentabnormality)
Strokes can be split into MINOR STROKE = can function independently despite deficits & MAJOR STROKE = needing help because of deficits.
NOTE: TIAs are often called MINI-STROKES, causing some confusion with ‘minor’ stroke.
Also TIAs are often misdiagnosed (diagnosis is based on description of fleeting symptoms), so recurrent symptoms may be due to another cause (like hypoglycaemia in diabetics).
TIA & stroke are caused by a blockage of blood flow to a part of the brain.
Roughly speaking, duration of blockage predicts type of presentation. (Brief seconds > TIA; minutes > minor; permanent > major)
All indicate that something is wrong in the body causing a tendency to clot (prothrombotic), and thus risk of recurrence.
TIA is the initial ‘warning’ symptom, and some (about 1 in 4) people have one or more TIA(s) before a stroke.
Repeated TIAs indicate the need to consider…, if not already done (not an exhaustive list, but covers main issues):
Is there disease in the carotid artery? “Carotid atheroma” - detectable by an ultrasound Doppler usually.
Is there a cardiac arrhythmia? If not seen on an ECG, consider longer term cardiac monitoring to seek intermittent or paroxysmal irregularity.
Are there risk factors that are poorly controlled? - e.g. current smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes are the most prominent.
Are the appropriate medications being prescribed and taken as prescribed?
I would suggest a medical review to consider the above. Hope this helps.
Have a look at the UK National Health Service webpage on TIA: Transient ischaemic attack (TIA)"
6099f704,Is it possible for a heart attack and a stroke to occur at the same time?,"Yes, it is possible to have a heart attack (myocardial infarction) and a stroke (cerebrovascular infarction) at the same time. It is a very rare condition, which has been described as a “cardio-cerebral infarction”.
It is a very rare occurrence for an artery in the heart and an artery in the brain to both get obstructed due to rupture of their respective atheromatous plaques (that is rupture of the membrane which covers material such as oxidised cholesterol that has abnormally accumulated in the inner layer of the wall of the arteries in the process of the disease caused atherosclerosis). In most cases, the mechanism of a concurrent myocardial infarction and stroke is usually thromboembolic rather than atherosclerotic, meaning that the blood clots do not form independently at the two sites, but are detached pieces of a larger piece of blood clot which have travelled along with the blood stream.
The origin of such a thromboembolic event is usually a blood clot in the left side of the heart (the side which sends blood to organs such as the brain and the outer surface of the blood itself) due to a rhythm disorder (arrhythmia) called atrial fibrillation. Less commonly, it is a blood clot that has originally formed in the veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis), which reaches the right side of the heart first (as the blood from most veins of the body does) and then gets squeezed into the left side of the heart through a hole in the septum separating the right from the left atrium (as in the so called patent foramen ovale).
Concomitant acute right ventricular infarction and ischemic cerebrovascular
stroke
; possible explanations
There are no guidelines about what to do in case of a “hyperacaute simultaneous cardiocerebral infarction”, in patients presenting within the thrombolytic therapeutic window and with the possibility of a primary coronary intervention within 2 hours from diagnosis.
Hyperacute Simultaneous Cardiocerebral Infarction: Rescuing the Brain or the Heart First?
If the patient presents within a time frame of 4,5 hours from the onset of symptoms of a stroke (so called window of opportunity), it is possible to do thrombolysis (also called fibrinolytic therapy), that is to administer a medication that can dissolve the blood clot, without the risk of secondary bleeding (haemorrhagic complications) getting unacceptably high. Patients with strokes who present after 4,5 hours (for a certain type of strokes after 6 hours) from the onset of symptoms or where the onset of symptoms is uncertain, for example because they woke up with the symptoms after sleeping for more than 4,5 hours, are treated conservatively, because the bleeding risk from thrombolysis would be unacceptably high. A stroke due to bleeding (due to rupture or leak of an artery) can have the same or even more disastrous consequences as an ischaemic stroke (the latter being due to the obstruction of an artery).
For patients presenting within 12 (or up to 72) hours from onset of symptoms of a severe heart attack (an ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI), there is a better alternative to thrombolysis: a primary coronary intervention (PCI), meaning that the doctor goes into the coronary artery with a catheter, dilates the narrow part (stenosis) with a balloon and places a stent that releases medication (drug eluting stent) which prevents a stenosis from happening again at the same site (re-stenosis). The combination of thrombolysis and coronary intervention carries a high bleeding risk, so thrombolysis is only done instead of primary coronary intervention (PCI) if the anticipated time until the patient reaches a PCI centre and gets the PCI done is longer than 2 hours from the diagnosis of the severe myocardial infarction (STEMI). That is because after 2 hours of not getting enough blood, so many heart muscle cells are dead or programmed for death, that it would have been better if the patient had been treated with thrombolysis and not primary coronary intervention, even if that means that he would not be able to get a coronary intervention with a catheter for another 24 hours.
But what to do with the patient presenting both with stroke and with ST-elevation myocardial infarction? Depending on the timing, a strategy might be to forego thrombolysis altogether and to perform primary coronary intervention on the coronary artery and (mechanical) endovascular embolectomy with a different catheter device on the cerebral artery, as explained in that case report:

6859f12a,What are the long and short term effects of a stroke? What varying symptoms occur before and after a stroke survivor?,"I’m a stroke survivor. I know exactly how lucky I have been, but I still hate it.
I had a right-side ischemic (clot) stroke with damage to the right posterior basal ganglia. The damage is small- only 1.2 cm across. The effects, though, are big.
I did not lose consciousness nor have my cognitive abilities been damaged according to the Speech Language Pathologist. I could bear weight and had a reciprocal gait the next day. However—
I had no idea where my left hand was- none. Once it was bent up behind me, and the nurse had to reposition because I was nearly laying on it, and didn’t know it wasn’t resting comfortably in front of me. If I held a cup of water in that hand and wasn’t looking at it every second, I would spill it- not from lack of strength, but because I didn’t know where it was and what position it was in, so the cup would tilt and spill. This is called proprioception- and I lost left side proprioception in a really weird way.
The loss in the upper limb- the hand- is pretty classic; the loss in the lower limb, hip to toes, was weird. Unlike not knowing where my foot was without looking, I lost bits and pieces of proprioception. For instance, I had my toes, but not my ankle. I could feel weight on my knee, but not my calf. My hip was all buggered up by it, with some muscles of the joint being known and others just along for the ride. In Therapy, they worked on strength so I could at least walk without a walker, but it took time to get all my bits and pieces back so I could do it correctly. I have stumped around like Igor for the past four months, but this past week, I seem to be getting back the last piece in my hip which is effecting the psoas muscle. Hooray for me!
But, I still hate it.
I am no longer graceful- I was so graceful and competent. I moved swiftly and unerringly; I could walk two miles in 15 minutes; I could reach and bend and crouch and stretch and climb and move.
Now I have to think about every move I make. I have to think when I walk- consciously think about each bit of the stride, chiding myself when my heel doesn’t strike the floor in the correct cadence, when I don’t push off with my toes hard enough, screwing up the gait. It is so tiring. It is so disheartening to have to do this, to have to be so super-aware of what used to be done naturally, with no thought, at all.
I await the day I suddenly realize I haven’t had to think about all of this- I hope it comes soon.
But, I am lucky- very, very lucky. I could have lost the ability to swallow correctly, thus being on a feeding tube (worst case) or pureed mush diet for, well, ever. I could have lost the ability to speak, the larnyx frozen. I could have lost cognitive ability- as is, for the first couple months, it was as if the toy box where I held my stuff had been given a big shake; I knew I had whatever bit I needed, but had to sort through to find it again. But I could have lost all of it, I could have lost my life, so I am lucky.
And all my therapists seem so surprised to learn I am only 4 months out from this stroke; “You’re already back at work?” “You don’t have to push so hard, you know”; yes, I do, because I know the earlier I get back, the more I get back, so it’s off to the races as far as I am concerned.
There was no precursor to my stroke. In fact, the whole episode took about 10 minutes- How do you stop a stroke while it’s happening? I’ve read some people feel dizzy sometimes, but there’s usually no sign it’s coming.
Which is why they can be so deadly.
If you are at risk for stroke, follow your doctor’s instructions- if you can get away from having this happen to you, you’ll be glad."

1cc02028,"What are the symptoms, causes, and warning signs of a stroke that occurs in the human body?","Symptoms
If you or someone you're with may be having a stroke, pay particular attention to the time the symptoms began. Some treatment options are most effective when given soon after a stroke begins.
Signs and symptoms of stroke include:
1 Trouble speaking and understanding what others are saying. You may experience confusion, slur your words or have difficulty understanding speech.
2 Paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg. You may develop sudden numbness, weakness or paralysis in your face, arm or leg. This often affects just one side of your body. Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time. If one arm begins to fall, you may be having a stroke. Also, one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile.
3 Problems seeing in one or both eyes. You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double.
4 Headache. A sudden, severe headache, which may be accompanied by vomiting, dizziness or altered consciousness, may indicate that you're having a stroke.
5 Trouble walking. You may stumble or lose your balance. You may also have sudden dizziness or a loss of coordination.
Causes
There are two main causes of stroke: a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may have only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), that doesn't cause lasting symptoms.
1 Ischemic stroke
Ischemic strokeOpen pop-up dialog box
This is the most common type of stroke. It happens when the brain's blood vessels become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia). Blocked or narrowed blood vessels are caused by fatty deposits that build up in blood vessels or by blood clots or other debris that travel through your bloodstream and lodge in the blood vessels in your brain.
Some initial research shows that COVID-19 infection may be a possible cause of ischemic stroke, but more study is needed.
2 Hemorrhagic stroke:
Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in your brain leaks or ruptures. Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect your blood vessels. Factors related to hemorrhagic stroke include:
Uncontrolled high blood pressure
Overtreatment with blood thinners (anticoagulants)
Bulges at weak spots in your blood vessel walls (aneurysms)
Trauma (such as a car accident)
Protein deposits in blood vessel walls that lead to weakness in the vessel wall (cerebral amyloid angiopathy)
Ischemic stroke leading to hemorrhage
A less common cause of bleeding in the brain is the rupture of an abnormal tangle of thin-walled blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation).
Transient Ischemic Stroke:
A transient ischemic attack (TIA) — sometimes known as a ministroke — is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those you'd have in a stroke. A TIA doesn't cause permanent damage. They're caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of your brain, which may last as little as five minutes.Like an ischemic stroke, a TIA occurs when a clot or debris reduces or blocks blood flow to part of your nervous system.Seek emergency care even if you think you've had aTIA because your symptoms got better. It's not possible to tell if you're having a stroke or TIAbased only on your symptoms. If you've had a TIA, it means you may have a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to your brain. Having TIA increases your risk of having a full-blown stroke later."
5a3cb4bd,"In a 4-stroke gasoline engine, how many times does spark occur in a cycle?","Traditionaly discounting single cylinder engines, a spark occurs every second crankshaft turn at or just before TDC at the end of the compression stroke.
Most single cylinder engines and some vehicles with shared coils between cylinders which are one crankshaft turn away can have a spark firing at the end of the exhaust stroke as well as at the end of the compression stroke. The extra spark does nothing on the end of the exhaust stroke. An example of a car engine which has a V6 engine with 3 coils and the plugs fire every revolution is the 3.8litre GM V6 used in the Holden Commodore. The firing order for this engine is 1–2–3–4–5–6. The opposing cylinder fired with number 1 is 4, 2 with 5 and 3 with 6. All Briggs and Stratton, Honda, Subaru and a number of unbranded Chinese lawnmower engines fire every crankshaft turn as they have no distributor and the flywheel leaves no room to place a trigger mechanism on the end of the camshaft. It would also be a pain to service unless there were windows in the flywheel."
dd4b625d,"How many ignition events occur for every 360 degree rotation of the crankshaft in a 4 cylinder, 4 stroke engine?","Two “ignition events” take place but in two different cylinders. An easy way to understand this is to remember that the distributor in a 4 stroke 4 cylinder engine sends out a spark every 90 degrees of the distributor, the second thing to remember is that the distributor turns at half the speed of the crankshaft, this means that when the crankshaft did 360 degrees (one full revolution) the distributor did only 180 degrees (half a revolution), thus it went through two 90 degrees intervals and therefor supplied two sparks for the “ignition events” or firing strokes/power strokes."
5bd05b02,"In Otto cycle, when the 1st compression stroke is occurring where is it receiving work to do the compression stroke?","During compression it uses power from previous cycles which is stored in flywheel.

b8fc80b7,How many diseases can occur due to a stroke?,"Its not a matter of getting diseases from a stroke. The stroke can affect any part of your body. With strokes it is how severely a person is affected. This can vary enormously. Mini strokes do not usually do so much harm. A major stroke could disable you for life. There are many degrees of seriousness in between. Any stroke has to be taken seriously though. A person can get a series of strokes. If a person suffers from any stroke, then certain life changes need to be made in order to avoid getting any more. If you are very lucky then it may not do permanent damage. Sometimes people recover, and regain their faculties. Unfortunately this is not always the case. There's no way of predicting how much harm a stroke may do. There are ways to avoid them, by living a healthy lifestyle."
a9e943e3,Was it a master stroke by Modi Government in passing the EBC bill in LS and such thought never occurred by earlier governments?,"This was attempted by PVN when Mandal commission recommendations were implemented. SC struck down saying that economic backwardness alone can not be basis for reservations. Gujarati govt. tried this before recent elections and was set aside by Gujarati high court. This is a old wine in an old bottle.
Like Ram Mandir this is another ploy to gain political advantage in 2019 elections. Govt. jobs are few and the demand for jobs can only be met by creation of jobs in private sector. Having failed to do this, Govt. has taken a dangerous path that may boomerang.
The proposal classifies those earning Rs 8,00,000/- as economically backward and provides reservation in Govt. jobs. But why is the Govt. not exempting these poor people from income tax by raising income tax threshold to Rs 800000/-?
Again those owning more than 5 acres of agricultural land are not eligible for reservations. Does Govt. think that farmers owning 6 acres and above earn net income of Rs 800000/- making them ineligible for reservations?
All this shows that this is not being done with good intent to help people and is being done hastily without consultations.

ec6d10ae,Does a 4-stroke gasoline engine spark occur two times in a cycle?,"It depends upon the type of ignition system used. A wasted spark ignition system will fire every time the Piston approaches top dead center. Even when the Piston is coming up on the exhaust stroke, the spark plug will still fire, even though the spark is of no value. This is done to make a cost-effective ignition system. This is very common in single cylinder, 4-stroke engines and automobile engines when they first went away from distributor style ignition systems in the 1980s."

f9ef38a3,Why does cough occur when drinking water in stroke-affected patients?,"Majority of stroke survivors experience dysphagia( difficulty in swallowing) after a stroke event. Swallowing is a complicated task which needs the brain co-ordinate a lot of muscles. Since the stroke affects the brain, it causes inability to swallow the food entering the oesophagus. When a person aspirates, while they are swallowing, it accidentally enters thier airway and lungs. This triggers the coughing reaction. Most of the stroke patients will not be present with a cough reflex, they would have aspiration since the sensation reduces.
What you can do about it:
There are a variety of swallowing exercises which can help stroke patients symptomatically from difficulty in swallowing.
Yawning: Open the jaw as far as he can for 10 seconds. Rest for 5 seconds. Do 5 repeats for 2 times a day. This action promotes upper movement of the larynx ( voice box) and the esophagus.
Effortful Swallow: let him imagine to have a marble stuck in his throat. Educate him to squeeze as hard as he can with his throat muscles. Do 5 repeats for 2 times a day. This improve the movement of tongue base and pharynx.
Resistive tongue exercise: Pushing the tongue hard against the roof of the mouth.Push tongue hard against each cheek. Push strong hard against a tongue depressor or spoon. Hold for 10 seconds. Do 5 repeats for 2 times a day. This improve tongue strength and control of food and drink.
Epiglottic control: Improve airway protection when you swallow. Open your mouth wide. Exhale the air from your lungs, but do not allow any air to escape from your mouth. Your airway should remain closed. You will be exhaling against a closed throat so air cannot escape. Hold for 10 seconds. Do 5 reps 2 times per day.
Need Patience With The Patient: It may be hard to co-operate with a patient and even harder if he/ she is elder. Stroke patients will have anxiety and depression symptoms too. So make sure that you are patient enough and not expecting for a quick fix.
Results will be slow but these exercises will take care to not worsen the symptoms. Discuss about this with your doctor too cuz I am aware of the patient's previous history.

666d02b2,"In multi-cylinder engine arrangement, are the cylinders so arranged that the power stroke in all the cylinders never occurs simultaneously?","There would be no point in designing virtually a single cylinder engine with multiple cylinders. The whole point of multiple cylinders and pistons is to distribute the power smoothly so that a large flywheel is not needed to smooth the engine vibrations. The reciprocating mass of each piston is less in a multi cylinder engine, so there is that balance advantage, but it is the reduction of vibration and smooth acceleration that is required for a car. This is better suited to staggered power strokes. Also, if the pistons were arranged so that several power strokes occurred simultaneously, there would be repercussions on the camshaft by opening and closing two sets of valve springs at once. There probably were attempts in the past to play around with designs, but the ones that are the best are still in production today, and none of them have simultaneous power strokes in modern automobiles.
There are radial 2 stroke engines such as the Hiness 3 Cylinder two-stroke radial that did have simultaneous power strokes, but they are not used as automobile engines."

Which complications could a patient get?,"I’m not sure what you’re looking for. I had a hemorrhage in my brain (hemorrhagic stroke). They watched me closely for about 24 hours looking for signs of pressure inside the cranium that would require emergency surgery. Then they did another CT scan to check whether the bleeding had stopped. If it hadn’t stopped, I would have needed surgery to stop it.
A Speech Therapist tested my ability to swallow on the 2nd day. I’d had nothing by mouth at that point. My swallowing was not perfect, so they put me on thickened liquids (yuck!) and soft foods. They didn’t want me to aspirate food or drink and develop bacterial pneumonia.
My blood pressure was sky high during the acute stroke, and they lowered it very slowly to avoid shocking the brain with the change in pressure. I was in ICU for two weeks until my BP was under 160. Then, I was transferred to a critical care telemetry unit.
The blood that had leaked into my brain had burst into one of the ventricles and displaced the cerebrospinal fluid that normally fills the ventricles. The blood drained slowly into my spine, causing a ferocious headache that lasted over a week. The headache was painful, but harmless.
The nurses watched over the side that was paralyzed. They carefully positioned my “useless” arm on a pillow. They kept my “dead” leg covered and warm. I couldn’t feel anything on that side, so the nurses were making sure I did not harm myself by getting into a position that cut off blood flow to a limb.
My affected arm hung like dead weight from my shoulder. It pulled on the shoulder joint all the way across to my neck. I couldn’t feel anything except the deep pain of the strained muscles or tendons, but it felt nice when the nurses rubbed liniment into the area. They placed my arm on a pile of pillows to support it and protect the shoulder joint.
That is about all I remember about complications in my case, but when I got to rehab and worked in groups of stroke survivors, I saw that many of them had ugly craniotomy incisions. A craniotomy has many risks of complications as well, though since I didn’t need one (thank goodness!)I don’t know what they are.
In my first week of rehab, I was assessed for deficits. They tested my limbs, my eyesight, my sensation, my strength, etc. They also tested me for cognitive deficits in memory, attention, executive function, and other things."
0a98b97e,What occurs in each combustion chamber during the operation of a 4-stroke cycle Otto engine?,The fuel air mixture will swirl around the combustion chamber as the piston rises to compress it. Just before the piston is at the top of the cylinder the spark plug will ignite the mixture and a very fast burn and expansion of the mixtures occurs. This expansion pushes the piston down on the power stroke. How cleanly and completely the fuel burns is a function of the combustion chamber and inlet manifold design. Please note there is no explosion just an extremely fast controlled expansion.

700309ed,How do you treat heat stroke?,
70834ebb,What are the leading risk factors for having a stroke?,"If you can answer this in a Quora answer, I’d say you deserve the Nobel’s Prize in Medicine!
In some cases, it’s obvious what caused a stroke: if somebody’s obese, has really high blood pressure, is really old, etc., it’s pretty clear-cut.
But I was 115 pounds, 90/60, and 24 years old when I had my stroke. My doctors looked at me, referred me to a cardiologist for another test, which was negative, and told me to go on my way. “The chance of you having a subsequent stroke is very small,” they assured me.
Six months later, I was back in the hospital with another one. =(
About six months after THAT, I was able to peer out from beneath my lead jacket of fatigue and pick my head up enough to wonder WHY I’d had a second one. It’d be nice to figure it out, I wagered, to prevent a third one. At that point, I’d already decided that if I had another one, JUST LET ME DIE.
My speech therapist referred me to a neurologist at the big city hospital nearby. In retrospect, he was nuts, but he did decide to perform a test just to check for certain that the cardiologist I’d originally seen hadn’t missed anything. (The first test, a TEE — trans esophageal echocardiogram — checked for a hole in my heart by sticking a camera down my throat look to look at my heart. The second test, a TCD — transcranial doppler — shot minuscule bubbles into my arm via an IV and listened to my brain to see if any of them made it up there.) Lo and behold, it dinged! I had a hole in my heart that allowed bubbles/clots/etc to pass through a ventricle and into my brain.
But, a week later, the neurologist called and said he wasn’t sure that the hole was the cause of my stroked. He explained that doctors usually require both a hole and a hypercoagulable disease — i.e. you need a hole in your heart and a reason to have a clot. “Why the h*ll did you have me do this test, then?” I wanted to shout.
To make a long story short, I decided to go ahead and have surgery to close the hole. It’s not terribly risky, but it is heart surgery. I haven’t had another stroke in 12 years, I’ve had a very good neurologist tell me that clots sometimes form in the area right around the hole *just because*, I’ve had doctors tell me to get my head screwed on straight — everybody knows a hole isnt enough without a hypercoagulable disease … I’ve pretty much just given up having any chance of ever knowing what caused my strokes.
So please, figure it out! LOL"
a5877bc6,How can I prevent myself from having a stroke?,"Currently, we have no Heimlich maneuver for CVA, other than a substance called TPA, which is injected into the bloodstream and causes any clots to break apart, thus opening any blocked vesicles in the brain. BUT— and it’s a big but—
CVAs can be caused by clots (ischemic), yessireee, but they can also be caused by bleeds (hemorrhagic). If you have a bleed in your brain causing symptoms of stroke, and you just happen to have some TPA laying around, and you just happen to still be capable of injecting said TPA into your vein to break up a clot you think you have, do you know what happens? The bleed in your brain bleeds faster, and you could bleed out, because TPA works on clots, not bleeds.
So, you’re having stroke symptoms- sided weakness, some pins-and-needles, confusion- is it being caused by a clot or a bleed? Quickly now- guess correctly and quickly, you want to stop this immediately, remember?
Bzzzzzzt! Time’s up and guess what, you can’t know without a CT scan. What? You don’t have a CT scanner at your house? Well now what?! How are you going to stop this immediately without a CT scanner?
You are going to call 911 or whatever your emergency services number is, and let trained, qualified medical professionals do their job and get your clogged or bleeding brain to a hospital as fast as they can. Time is brain functioning in a stroke; we have stretched the golden hour to the golden three hours, but less than one hour is still best.
You will be immediately evaluated while in the ambulance and wheeled directly to radiology for that CT scan. The scan will be read by a neurologist who will determine if there is a bleed- no bleed, you’ll be offered TPA. You say yes, the nurse adds a small bag of clear fluid to your IV. Within minutes, you start to feel less confused, not so groggy. Every minute after that, you ‘clear’ a bit more. You may come all the way back in a matter of hours, there may always be some residual damage, you won’t know until you are on your individual journey.
If the scan showed a bleed, you will be whisked into surgery and the bleed will be stopped if possible- if accessible. Sometimes a transfusion of clotting factors can be given if the bleed cannot be reached. Then, of course, care must be taken there’s not a clot in the brain, too. You may come all the way back in a matter of hours, there may always be some residual damage, you won’t know until you are on your individual journey.
But, that is the best we have right now, and it is far and away better than what we had even a quarter century ago. Thank your lucky stars."
21df3f64,Why do people that suffer from migraines have a higher risk of stroke?,"Yes it can. There are several migraine types that can—one reporter on TV, in fact, about a year ago, had a migraine attack on screen and they thought she had a stroke. It is very common.
To test if it is a stroke or migraine is hard because if you have hemiplegic, one side of your body will go off-line and tests for stroke will show stroke even if that’s not what you have. It is best to get into the hospital for a doctor’s examination to see if it is a stroke or migraine.
Migraine is an electrolyte imbalance caused by the over-activity of the sensory neurons. In a migraineur’s brain, the sensory neurons have much more connections than the same neurons in a typical non-migraine brain. This is why migraineurs tend to be overstimulated by strong bright lights, strong odors, loud sounds, more sensitive to touch, and some (like me) also are super-tasters, so more sensitive to spices.
Because of the hyper-reaction of the brain to sensory stimulus, it generates more voltage—voltage is communication in the brain—and that extra voltage uses more sodium. Migraineurs need more salt in their diet to counter this effect. A study showed that migraineurs lose over 50% more sodium in their urine than non-migraineurs—eating the same thing.
Migraineurs are also glucose sensitive (carbs intolerant) because glucose removes sodium and water from cells—therefore, carbs reduce brain sodium even more for migraineurs, causing a migraine.

Pantetheine is a metabolite of vitamin B5 that has been shown in studies to reduce total and LDL cholesterol. as well to increase HDL. lt can be effective particularly for people with diabetes. Take 600 to 900 mg daily.
Soy protein
Soy protein has been shown in studies to reduce total and LDL cholesterol and to increase HDL. Take 25 to 50 grams daily.
Reishi
Reishi is a mushroom extract that reduces cholesterol. Take 800 mg two to three times daily.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
In a 2003 study, scientists discovered that eating fish several times per week reduces risk of thrombotic stroke (a type of ischemic stroke that occurs when a blood clot forms in arteries in the neck or brain). An earlier study also found that high consumption of fish and omega-3 fatty acids may be linked to decreased risk of thrombotic stroke.
Calcium
Calcium is very important in rectifying all circulatory diseases and disorders including stroke. Because calcium is the most alkaline mineral in the mineral family, it helps to counteract acidity and bust up accumulated debris that stick to the arterial walls and thus open up clogged and obstructed arteries. Natural calcium-rich herbs include: Comfrey Root, Oatstraw, Horsetail, and Alfalfa.
Other beneficial herbs for stroke prevention and remedy include: Cayenne, Ginger, Cinnamon, Butcher’s Broom, Gotu Kola, Cranesbill, Goldenseal Root, Manjistha, Holy (Blessed) Thistle, Gingko Biloba, and Mullein Leaf."

Participants
(n=4897) who were stroke- and dementia-free at 55 years of age were
followed biennially for up to 51 years. ... A total of 875 participants
(522 women) developed a first-ever stroke; 749 (448 women) had an
ischemic stroke. LTR of stroke was high and remained similar at ages 55,
65, and 75 years, approximating 1 in 5 for women and 1 in 6 for men.
Participants with a normal BP (<120/80 mm Hg) had approximately half
the LTR of stroke compared with those with high BP (=140/90 mm Hg)
We observed that the LTR of stroke for middle-aged and ""young-old""
adults (55 to 75 years of age) was substantial at 1 in 6 or higher. This
risk was higher in women (1 in 5) compared with men, largely because of
the greater life expectancy in women, which increased their period at
risk.

Stroke
is the third leading cause of death in most countries, and is one of
the leading causes of long-term disability. Women have a higher lifetime
risk of stroke than men (1 in 5 vs 1 in 6), a statistic that is
influenced in part by the longer life expectancy in women. The female
population not only carries a higher burden of stroke during their
lifespan - women also account for the majority of stroke deaths.

0b8a5117,Do vegetarians have a higher risk of stroke than meat eaters?,"If you read the article, and the study upon which the article is based, you will easily be able to answer this question for yourself.
The article NEVER states that vegetarians are at a higher risk of stroke. It states that people with severe deficiencies in certain essential nutrients are at higher risk of stroke. Chief among these being B12 complex, and even then, neither the article nor the study explicitly state that B12 deficiency is the CAUSE of this increased risk.
I am a vegan, and I take B12 supplements because the vegan diet does not naturally contain B12. Anyone that tries to make huge dietary changes with zero prior research, is an idiot. You will get sick, and you will feel like garbage. If you go vegan or try any other non omnivorous lifestyle, you must take supplements, period."
1e134a56,How high does blood pressure have to be to increase stroke risk?,"I am Kristen Gardner. Let me share some high blood pressure tricks from Bessie Vazquez’s website: Top 8 tips that can help to lower your high blood pressure in just 9 mins. Bessie Vazquez is a famous blogger about blood pressure.
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 1: Lose weight. Being overweight means that your heart has to pump blood to a larger body mass, which makes the heart work harder. Losing weight reduces the workload. “Plus, your heart will be better able to respond to circumstances that do require more work, like exercise,” says Dr. Zusman.
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 2: Exercise. Any activity that gets your heart pumping faster and your lungs working harder is one of the best ways to lower high blood pressure. “It improves the blood vessels’ ability to open and close, which improves blood flow,” says Dr. Zusman. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 3: Reduce your stress. Chronic stress may contribute to high blood pressure. More research is needed to determine the effects of chronic stress on blood pressure. Occasional stress also can contribute to high blood pressure if you react to stress by eating unhealthy food, drinking alcohol or smoking.
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 4: Reduce sodium in your diet
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 5: Control underlying conditions.
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 6: Stop caffeine.
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 7: Limit alcohol intake.
Bessie Vazquez’s Tip 8: Stop smoking.

Eggs and diary cause heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer and of course strokes too. They thicken your blood, clot your arteries, paralyze your arteries. And cause growths to emerge in your body sometimes, because thats what milk and eggs do, they cause growth."

All of these healthy habits you can add to your routine will help to minimize the risk of a stroke and keep you healthy and living longer. :) if you are trying to find exercises that are great for a healthy heart some may include swimming, running, and jump roping. I would also recommend standing for at least an hour while doing work instead of sitting to keep your blood moving. ;)"
6f348fdf,Why is the risk of a stroke in young people on the rise?,"I assume you're talking about the recent report published in the Annals of Neurology.
First, it's important to note that the increased risk over the last couple of decades looms large in terms of percentage but is quite small in terms of actual numbers: from 3.1 cases per 10,000 people to 4.7 cases per 10,000 people.
Second, the authors note that some of the increase isn't actually because more people are having strokes, but that we're getting better at detecting and diagnosing strokes.
Most of the young people who had strokes, according to the study, had diabetes or high blood pressure. So the risk factors that lead to diabetes or high blood pressure are, unsurprisingly, also risk factors for stroke: obesity, poor diet, smoking, lack of exercise."
786ce001,Why can smoking cause a stroke?,"A person who smokes 20 cigs a day is up to six times as likely to have a stroke as is a person in the general population
Cigarette smoke contains thousands of different toxins . Carbon monoxide and formaldehyde are two .
They are quickly absorbed into the circulation where they cause cell death and damage .
Smoking affects cholesterol levels in the body .
There are higher levels of LDL and lower HDL . The latter is "" good cholesterol "" . Both changes are associated with accelerated atherosclerosis .
The blood becomes more viscous .
Platelet function is disrupted and clots or micro clots form .
Arteries throughout the body are damaged . The intima becomes rough and clots easily adhere to this .
This is the mechanism by which ischemic stroke occurs .
The consequences of an ischemic stroke are often devastating ."
1d6779bd,"Do you believe that vegans can have a higher risk of stroke, or do you think this new study on vegans is nonsense?","Vegans and vegetarians may have higher stroke risk
People who eat vegan and vegetarian diets have a lower risk of heart disease and a higher risk of stroke, a major study suggests.
They had 10 fewer cases of heart disease and three more strokes per 1,000 people compared with the meat-eaters.
The research, published in the British Medical Journal
, looked at 48,000 people for up to 18 years.
However, it cannot prove whether the effect is down to their diet or some other aspect of their lifestyle.
Diet experts said, whatever people's dietary choice, eating a wide range of foods was best for their health.
What does this study add?
It analyses data from the EPIC-Oxford study, a major long-term research project looking at diet and health.
Half of participants, recruited between 1993 and 2001, were meat-eaters, just over 16,000 vegetarian or vegan, with 7,500 who described themselves as pescatarian (fish-eating).
They were asked about their diets, when they joined the study and again in 2010. Medical history, smoking and physical activity were taken into account,
Altogether, there were 2,820 cases of coronary heart disease (CHD) and 1,072 cases of stroke - including 300 haemorrhagic strokes, which happen when a weakened blood vessel bursts and bleeds into the brain.
The pescatarians were found to have a 13% lower risk of CHD than the meat-eaters, while the vegetarians and vegans had a 22% lower risk.
But those on plant-based diets had a 20% higher risk of stroke. The researchers suggested this could be linked to low vitamin B12 levels but said more studies were needed to investigate the connection.
It is also possible that the association may have nothing to do with people's diets and may just reflect other differences in the lives of people who do not eat meat
Video captionFake-meat and fries: The rise of vegan fast food
So does it show vegan and vegetarian diets are unhealthy?
Dr Frankie Phillips, from the British Dietetic Association, says not - because this was an observational study.
""They looked at what people ate and followed them for years, so it's an association, not cause-and-effect,"" she says.
""The message, for everyone, is it makes sense to have a well-planned diet, and to eat a wide variety of foods
Image captionA varied diet is the key, not ""meat and potatoes every night""
""Meat-eaters don't necessarily have a varied diet, because they might live on meat and potatoes for dinner every night and not have any vegetables.""
Has what people eat changed since this study started?
Researchers did go back to participants in 2010 to ask them again about their diets.
But Dr Phillips says vegan and vegetarian diets will have changed.

""This is data that's been collected from a couple of decades ago,"" she says.
""It might well be that the typical vegetarian diet today looks very different to a vegetarian or vegan diet from 20 or 30 years ago.
""The range of vegetarian and vegan convenience foods has escalated massively. It's a lot more mainstream.""
And we know more about the health risks linked to eating too much processed and red meat, which has been linked to an increased
risk
of bowel cancer.
.
So what should go on my plate?
The NHS's the Eatwell Guide
sets out the balance of foods you need, whatever kind of diet you eat:
Eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day
Base meals around higher-fibre starchy foods such as potatoes, bread, rice or pasta
Don't forget protein - from lean meat, fish, seafood, pulses, tofu or unsalted nuts
Include dairy or dairy alternatives
Foods high in fat, sugars or salt should be eaten less often and in small amounts
But people on vegan and vegetarian diets also need to take particular care to consume enough of some specific nutrients.
For example, people who eat meat, dairy and fish usually have enough vitamin B12, needed for healthy blood and nervous systems.
However, vegans can become deficient, though B12 is also present in foods such as fortified breakfast cereals and yeast extract spreads.
Iron is also less easily absorbed from plant-based foods, so those who choose not to eat meat need to ensure they include foods such as wholemeal bread and flour, dried fruits and pulses.
And there was a call last month
for vegans to be aware of the need to ensure they were consuming enough of another nutrient, called choline, important for brain health."

There are many good theoretical reasons why there could be an association. It could be that excess sleep causes strokes. It could be that the relation between sleep and stroke is moderated by an as-of-yet-unknown variable. It could be that the relation between sleep and stroke is mediated by an as-of-yet-unknown variable. It could be that both increased sleep and stroke are caused by a third variable and are spuriously correlated.
My guess would be the final reason. For example, maybe the adults are sleeping more because they are more depressed, which accounts for their increased amount of sleep. Simultaneously, depression increases the risk of stroke. Thus, the increased sleep and higher risk of stroke are spuriously correlated. But this is complete conjecture."

85a003bf,Why does cracking one's neck increase the risk of stroke?,"This pops up in the news frequently and has been proven false. In all cases, the stroke was in progress prior to the visit to the chiropractor. Multiple studies have been done that were unable to find a link between the two. Researchers from the Departments of Neurosurgery, at Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Loma Linda University Medical Center and The Pennsylvania State University, in conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of chiropractic neck manipulation and cervical artery dissection, found no convincing evidence to support a causal link. Further, the authors conclude that the unfounded belief in causation may lead to episodes of litigation.156Church et al. (2016) CureusWhedon et al. in a 2015 cohort study published in Spine Journal found that, “among Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years with an office visit for a neuro-musculoskeletal problem, risk of injury to the head, neck, or trunk within 7 days was 76 percent lower among subjects with a chiropractic office visit than among those who saw a primary care physician.”157Whedon et al. (2015) Spine JournalIn a separate 2015 cohort study, Whedon et al. found that “among Medicare B beneficiaries aged 66 to 99 years with neck pain, incidence of vertebrobasilar stroke was extremely low. Small differences in risk between patients who saw a chiropractor and those who saw a primary care physician are probably not clinically significant.”158Whedon et al. (2015) Journal of Manipulative andPhysiological TherapeuticsThe results of a case-control study in U.S. commercial and Medicare Advantage patient populations by Kosloff et al. concluded, “We found no significant association between exposure to chiropractic care and the risk of vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) stroke. We conclude that manipulation is an unlikely cause of VBA stroke. The positive association between primary care provider (PCP) visits and VBA stroke is most likely due to patient decisions to seek care for the symptoms (headache and neck pain) of arterial dissection. We further conclude that using chiropractic visits as a measure of exposure to manipulation may result in unreliable estimates of the strength of association with the occurrence of VBA stroke.”159Kosloff et al. (2015) Chiropractic Manual TherapyIn a 2008 population-based, case-control and case-crossover study published in Spine Journal, Cassidy et al. concluded that “Vertebrobasilar Artery (VBA) stroke is a very rare event in the population. The increased risks of VBA artery stroke associated with chiropractic and primary care medical provider visits is likely due to patients with headache and neck pain from vertebrobasilar artery dissection seeking care before their stroke.”The authors found no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care compared to primary care.160Cassidy et al.

d05bb059,Is it true that a glass of water before bed reduces the risk of a heart attack or stroke?,"Only if that glass of water washed down a baby aspirin.
Perhaps several glasses may have a “microeffect” on diluting concentrated blood, thus making blood less viscous or thick, and less likely to form a clot, but this is a far stretch to explain why that myth has been created."
d25a4fbb,Does aspirin increase the risk of stroke?,"The short answer is fairly straightforward. In the early stages of heart disease, cholesterol builds up in the walls of one or more coronary arteries. The deposits trigger inflammation, eventually producing plaques that narrow the artery. Large blockages may prevent the heart muscle from getting all the blood it needs, often causing the pain of angina. But a heart attack requires an additional insult, and in most cases, a small, relatively new plaque is the culprit. First, the plaque develops a fissure or rupture, exposing its contents to the bloodstream. Tiny blood cells called platelets stick to the ruptured plaque, and the sticky, activated platelets rapidly form a clot that completely blocks the artery, killing the heart muscle cells that rely on that particular artery for their oxygen-rich blood.
Aspirin prevents heart attacks by stopping platelets from sticking together and forming artery-blocking clots.

9155b31c,"Is it true that there is no proof of cholesterol lowering drugs lowering the rates of heart attacks and strokes? Instead, there is proof that consuming cholesterol lowering drugs contributes to the risks of having other diseases like diabetes, etc.","I am a scientist, and the only thing that matters to me is evidence, and quality of evidence matters most. Although your question is prejudicial, I will try to answer it nevertheless.
Firstly, there actually is robust evidence that cholesterol lowering drugs, called statins, have a statistically significant causal effect on lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. A systematic review (considered the pinnacle on the hierarchy of biomedical research
), published by the Cochrane Collaboration
, concluded that:
Of 1000 people treated with a statin for five years, 18 would avoid a major CVD event which compares well with other treatments used for preventing cardiovascular disease. Taking statins did not increase the risk of serious adverse effects such as cancer. Statins are likely to be cost-effective in primary prevention.
Systematic reviews roll up results from a large number of clinical studies, in this case 19 studies, to remove bias and other issues. In this case, statins clearly save lives.
Furthermore, the standard of care of most healthcare plans state that aggressively treating cholesterol in patients leads to better outcomes. Which means the healthcare plan is spared the expense of paying for angioplasty, stents, bypass surgery, and other expensive medical procedures.
As for stroke, statins have shown no significant causal effect on the risk of stroke. However, modern evidence-based medicine attacks stroke risk independent of cholesterol levels.
With respect to adverse effects,
there is no robust evidence that supports a causal effect between statin use and diabetes. In fact, diabetes is, in itself, linked to cardiovascular disease.
there is no robust evidence of a causal link between statins and cancer.
there is some evidence of rare and reversible cognitive decline with the use of statins. Once it is recognized by the physician, the FDA urges that the patient not receive the medication any longer.
there is also some evidence of muscle pain with the use of statins. However, there are a lot of confounding factors, like diabetes and high blood pressure, which could be linked to the muscle pain.
I know it’s cool for some people to criticize the use of statins because of some huge Big Pharma conspiracy. Unfortunately for them, the real scientific and clinical evidence contradicts those claims.
Oh one more thing. Science doesn’t “prove” anything – it makes provisional conclusions based on evidence supporting or nullifying a hypothesis.
Mathematics, albeit a science, uses proofs, which are inferential arguments within a mathematical statement."

So the word plaque causes confusion. Furthermore markers for inflammation will be detected in the blood without regard to the location of the inflammation.

And even people who have heart and circulatory problems can use Cannabis safely, but it is entirely dependent on the type of cardiovascular issue you suffer from.
“Cannabis consumption has been shown to cause arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia, and potentially sudden death, and to increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). These effects appear to be compounded by cigarette smoking and precipitated by excessive physical activity, especially during the first few hours of consumption. Cannabinoids, or the active compounds of cannabis, have been shown to have heterogeneous effects on central and peripheral circulation. Acute cannabis consumption has been shown to cause an increase in blood pressure, specifically systolic blood pressure (SBP), and orthostatic hypotension. Cannabis use has been reported to increase risk of ischemic stroke, particularly in the healthy young patients. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is currently considered as a promising therapeutic target in the management of several disease conditions.”
Role of cannabis in cardiovascular disorders
“These results suggest that, contrary to our hypothesis, marijuana use was not associated with increased risk of adverse short-term outcomes following AMI. Furthermore, marijuana use was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality post-AMI.” - Marijuana use and short-term outcomes in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction

If your risk of these things is raised then it worthwhile taking aspirin, only if prescribed by your doctor…
However, if there are no identifiable risks or actual known vascular disease then the risks of taking aspirin regularly (and there lots of potential issues) outweigh the benefits…
Bottom line: you should NOT be taking aspirin every day on your own initiative! If a doctor has evaluated you and deems aspirin (or even some other anti-platelet agent) to be appropriate, then sure, you take it! Otherwise no…"
f137e439,"How exactly do NSAIDs increase the risk for MI, stroke, etc.?","In short, they don’t. In fact, I was put on an aspirin a day following my second stroke to prevent any more infarcts. (It didn’t work, unfortunately, and I’ve since been told by a neurologist whose opinion I respect that a young adult who’s had a stroke should NEVER be discharged on aspirin — it doesn’t do the job well enough. But it does help!)
The catch is that though NSAIDs help prevent clotting, they can hurt you if you’re having a hemorrhagic (bleeding) stroke. This is why it’s very important to go to the ER and find out what’s going on rather than just popping an entire bottle of IBProfen; if you’re bleeding, taking NSAIDs could kill you."

Migraine with Aura is higher. around 2.6% for men, and 3.7% for women. (wrote 5 previously)
Chronic Migraine is an additional 0.5% or so.

Losing weight helps enormously and over time is hugely benificial. Of course having bariatric ‘surgery’ is only part of the journey, you will have dietary and pyshical training sessions over 6 months or more to teach you what you think is normal probably is not, i know as i went from 25 stone to 12 stone and my before, during and aftercare totalled 2 + years, and i was ignorant of so many things that i believed i knew. No matter how you choose to lose weight it will be very hard but the pay-off is worth the work you put in."

Your liver also makes it. Your body needs some cholesterol, but too much can block your arteries. That's why adults with high cholesterol are more likely to have heart attacks and stroke. Several health conditions, your lifestyle, and your age and family history can increase your risk for heart disease. These are called risk factors. About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.

035aa006,Is a study going to show that E-cigarette users face a higher risk of a heart attack and stroke? Will this change people’s habits?,"A key point here, conveniently buried towards the end of the article, is this statement made by one of the study’s authors:
“Dr Vindhyal, however, admitted his team could not completely eradicate the impact of previous tobacco use, because virtually all e-cigarette users in the study had smoked tobacco in the past.”
I’ve read peer reviews of this study, and I’m pretty sure that the reviewers commented that the good doctor didn’t even determine if the stroke/heart attack happened before or after the smoker switched from smoking to vaping. It would be reasonable to assume that many of them switched after having experienced a stroke or heart attack!
Studies like this are not science — they’re games that some people play with numbers to gain some publicity and good-will from the pharmaceutical industry that’s always on the lookout for some anti-vaping propaganda. No doubt this team will be well rewarded with funding for future “studies”.
The end of the article lists some other “findings” that are supposed to cause alarm, Some of them may have a grain of truth, but there is no indication of whether the risk is major or barely detectable, or whether the reaction was done to cells in a petri dish rather than in a living organ (which usually has sophisticated recovery skills), or if there was any comparison of the vaping effects to the effects of smoking.
In any case, no one says that vaping is harmless — it may be, and it may even have great beneficial effects, but we aren’t sure yet. However, the scientific consensus is that it’s much, much less harmful than smoking. I’d hope that drivel like this doesn’t persuade a vaper to change habits by going back to smoking — then Dr Vindhyal and the author of this article might have blood on their hands.
UPDATED Feb 18 2020 — The JAHA just issued a retraction of the article that announced the study. It took them almost a year to get around to it, but they have stated that peer review revealed that the researchers omitted key data from their analysis and this influenced the results. The researchers say that they can’t access the PATH data to try to validate their work, which I suspect is their way of saying “Ooops! My fingers are stuck in the cookie jar.”"

cceca3fd,Can eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables reduce your risk of stroke?,"Several studies have reported benefits on reducing stroke risk and improving the poststroke associated functional declines in patients who ate foods rich in fruits and vegetables. Their potential protective effects may be due to their antioxidants, calcium, potassium, riboflavine, peridoxin, riboflavin contents. Folic acid, peridoxin, and riboflavin are all cofactors in hyperhomocysteinemia as a stroke risk factor.Studies suggest that oxidative stress plays important roles in pathogenesis of ischemic cerebral injury and higher intake of antioxidants has been associated with a lower stroke risk. Filling half your plate with vegetables and fruit at each meal may help reduce your risk of heart disease
and stroke

Heart- stroke prevention
Many vegetables and fruit are particularly rich in vitamin C and in beta-carotene, which is a form of vitamin A. These work as antioxidants in your body, helping to slow down or prevent atherosclerosis by reducing the buildup of plaque from cholesterol and other substances in the arteries.
Some of the vitamin C dynamos are:
broccoli
red peppers
strawberries
oranges
kiwi
cantaloupe.
Since beta-carotene gives food a distinctive dark-orange, red or dark-green colour, you can easily spot the best sources, such as:
carrots
tomatoes
squash
pink grapefruit
sweet potatoes
swiss chard.
Here's a bonus: almost all vegetables and fruit are low in calories, fat
and sodium. In fact, research shows that high consumption of vegetables and fruit is associated with maintaining a healthy weight

6f46131a,How do you start to reverse heart disease without risking a stroke?,"Heart disease and stroke are two diseases with similar causes. Heart disease is caused by narrowing and atherosclerosis of the coronary vessels. Stroke is caused by the same disease process to the blood vessels to the brain. Usually if you want to prevent or improve the situation you need to identify what specific risk factors are present and try to eliminate or reduce them. So what are these factors?

1) Age- the older you get the higher the risk. No way to fix that.
2)Heredity- If you have bad genes you can't fix that ( special mention Arthur Ashe and Jin Fixx)
3)Male sex (although women are catching up)- sorry even pulling a Bruce to Kaitlin doesn't fix this
4)Hypertension- if you have had a lifetime of untreated hypertension then you have a lifetime of damage. Its always a got idea to fix the problem so it doesn't get worse but if for instance you start treating the problem at age 60 don't expect any of the damage to repair itself
5)Diabetis- (or even worse Metabolic syndrome) generally one doesn't wake up one day to find that they are diabetic. Usually you were on that road for a long time. So now it's time to get off that road. Diet and exercise. Yes, taking medication helps but I don't think you are going to reverse the damage with medication just slow it down
6)Hyperlidemia- sometimes genetic (see #2) but mostly due to bad diet and lifestyle choices (see #5)
7)Smoking- you would probably have to live in a cave and be illiterate to not know that smoking was killing you

so if you have arrived at the point where you now have ischaemic heart disease it is a little late to start thinking about reversing the process but here are a few things you can do;
A) diet- but you knew that already
B)exercise- made infinitely harder to do safely now that you have heart disease
C)antiplatelet drugs- to prevent clots forming in the narrow arteries. It doesn't reverse anything but it does prevent an MI or stroke
D)lipid lowering drugs- but wouldn't it be better if you had done the diet and exercise thing
E)Omega Fatty Acids- seem to help

I am not sure where the concern that diet and exercise is going to cause you to have a stroke?"
03bad1a7,How does one’s diet affect stroke risk?,"Diets high in saturated fats, trans fat and cholesterol have been linked to stroke and related conditions, such us heart disease.Too much sodium in the diet can raise blood pressure levels.If the diet is un-healthy with the excessive fats in the body inflammation is likely to occur, which will cause poor blood flow and porential blockages which is one major cause of stroke."
1f66067a,How does ibuprofen increase stroke risk if it thins the blood?,"Ibuprofen(NSAID), can cause marked worsening of existing hypertension or development of new high blood pressure. It can also cause damage to the kidneys, worsening of heart failure, and even heart attack or stroke. Drug-induced hypertension associated with NSAIDs is due to the renal effects of these drugs. NSAIDs cause dose-related increases in sodium and water retention. By inhibiting COX-2's natriuretic effect, thereby increasing sodium retention, all NSAIDs carry with them the consequent risk of increased fluid retention raises blood pressure."
5f58f001,Is it possible that stroke and altered mental status increase the risk of death in patients with COVID-19?,"People hospitalized with COVID-19 and neurological problems including stroke and confusion, have a higher risk of dying than other COVID-19 patients, according to a study published online today by researchers at Montefiore Health System and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the journal Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. These findings have the potential to identify and focus treatment efforts on individuals most at risk and could decrease COVID-19 deaths.
The study looked at data from 4,711 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Montefiore during the six-week period between March 1, 2020 and April 16, 2020. Of those patients, 581 (12%) had neurological problems serious enough to warrant brain imaging. These individuals were compared with 1,743 non-neurological COVID-19 patients of similar age and disease severity who were admitted during the same period.
""This study is the first to show that the presence of neurological symptoms, particularly stroke and confused or altered thinking, may indicate a more serious course of illness, even when pulmonary problems aren't severe,"" said David Altschul, M.D., chief of the division of neurovascular surgery at Einstein and Montefiore and associate professor in the Leo M. Davidoff Department of Neurological Surgery and of radiology at Einstein. ""Hospitals can use this knowledge to prioritize treatment and, hopefully, save more lives during this pandemic.""
Among people who underwent brain imaging, 55 were diagnosed with stroke and 258 people exhibited confusion or altered thinking ability. Individuals with stroke were twice as likely to die (49% mortality) compared with their matched controls (24% mortality) -- a statistically significant difference. People with confusion had a 40% mortality rate compared with 33% for their matched controls -- also statistically significant.
More than half the stroke patients in the study did not have hypertension or other underlying risk factors for stroke. ""This highly unusual finding agrees with other studies of people with COVID-19 in suggesting that infection with the novel coronavirus is itself a risk factor for stroke,"" said Dr. Altschul, who is also surgical director of the Montefiore Comprehensive Center for Stroke Care, and the study co- author, along with Emad Eskandar, M.D., M.B.A., chair of neurological surgery at Einstein and Montefiore, professor in the Leo M. Davidoff Department of Neurological Surgery, the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, in the Dominick P. Purpura Department of Neuroscience at Einstein. Dr. Eskandar also holds the Jeffrey P. Bergstein Chair and the David B. Keidan Chair in Neurological Surgery.
The paper is titled, ""Neurologic Syndromes Predict Higher In-Hospital Mortality in COVID-19."" The senior author was Mark Mehler, M.D., professor and chair of the Saul R. Korey Department of Neurology at Einstein and Montefiore, professor of neuroscience and of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, director of the Institute for Brain Disorders and Neural Regeneration, and the Alpern Family Foundation Chair in Cerebral Palsy Research.

That was probably engineered by Big Tobacco to get back at us weed smokers!”
The weird thins is actually that they’re making this announcement NOW??? Instead of 30–40 years ago???? (At least in terms of smoking!)
As for vaping, I haven’t read the studies on it yet, but I’m surprised they’re making the claim as nothing I’ve read about vaping would indicate it would have an effect on the heart. Nicotine has been largely absolved of “bad for the heart” claims, with it being replaced by Carbon Monoxide…. or at least so I thought!
Hmmm… OK, the article makes at least SOME points regarding smoking and regarding possible psychogenic responses among older folks getting “high” (e.g. “OMG! I can feel my heart beating! OMGOGOG! It’s STOPPED!! Oh… whew… ok… it started again. but it’s going thumpity thump thump sometimes and just thumpity thump sometimes? AM I GOING TO DIE????? AIIEEEEEEE!

How do I deal with this?","As I'm getting older also, and have had several friends and relatives die within the past two years, I have also begun to have occasional fearful thoughts about my mortality and the disabilities I might one day face.
At my last doctor's visit I spoke about this with her. She's a few years younger than I but she told me it's normal, to an extent, to have thoughts such as this as we age. She said she tells herself she's here, now, this day, and that's all that's guaranteed anyone. Even a young person could have an accident or suddenly become gravely ill. She said she simply pushes thoughts of such from her mind, works and finds distractions and doesn't dwell on it. I've been trying to do the same with a fair degree of success.
This is probably just a temporary rumination, you will probably pass through this phase. Of course everyone on the planet is mortal but why ruin today thinking about the future? It's helpful if you could share your thoughts with close friends or family. My sisters and I recently spoke on the subject in a light-hearted tone. We all agreed we wouldn't want to live forever, even if we could. We even managed to have a few laughs about the potential upcoming infirmaries.

72940b50,How can PPI drugs cause an increased risk of stroke?,"Here’s a 2017 observational study that corroborates the findings in the 2016 observational study linked in the question: Proton-Pump Inhibitor Use and the
Risk
of First-Time Ischemic
Stroke
in the General Population: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.
The authors of the 2017 study discuss a few hypotheses:
Inhibition of CYP2C19 by PPIs could lead to compromised efficacy of clopidogrel. Given that the association has been observed for those not on clopidogrel, the authors seem skeptical of this proposed mechanism.
PPIs could increase the plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is a risk factor for cardiovascular events. The authors note that this finding was in mice and failed to replicate in humans.
So, we don’t yet have a good proposal for a mechanism that might explain the association of PPI use with stroke.
I’d also caution that these studies don’t attempt to quantify the risk of not taking a PPI when they are indicated; untreated reflux may be more likely to cause laryngeal cancer, for example.
I should note that I have taken a PPI daily for several years so I follow the literature pretty closely and have yet to see convincing evidence that I should stop."
c52864e1,"What do we eat now? 'Study finds vegan and vegetarian diets increase risk of a stroke compared to eating meat', is this in anyway true?","Yes it is true…also vegetables are full of vitamin and minerals, fibers ,proteins, fats and carbohydrates. The same as fruits which are containing lots of sugar in its different forms like sucrose, fructose which represent the most harmful effects for increasing INSULIN RESISTANCE that causes inflammation of the body blood vessels internal walls. By hurting these vessels through injuries, body trying to treat these injuries by lining with vLDL cholesterol which in turn accumulates in the internal blood vessels causing cardiovascular diseases and stroke as well.
Liver produces a daily needed amount of cholesterol whatever you supply body from external sources or not as liver regulates to have this amounts. When we consume NATURAL FATS like cow's meat, butter, ghee and full milk products like cheeses the body turns to burn fats instead of burning Glucose coming from vegetables and fruits. Body brain prefers to burn fats to get energy than burning Glucose as fats give energy double that of Glucose.
Now you understand that the main cause of cardiovascular problems and stroke is inflammation made by extra Glucose levels together with excess insulin excretion accordingly.
Consuming gracey feeding animals products are completely safer than using Refined sugar, starchy carbohydrates and Triglycerides of all extracted oils. Exception of coconut oil and milk, almond oil and milk, cold extracted olive oil they're all safe and healthy."

675c45d2,Can patients who have had a stroke caused by bleeding in the brain safely take aspirin to reduce the risk of future strokes?,"Hi Jared. A stroke caused by bleeding into the brain is a hemorrhagic stroke. It’s the “opposite” of an ischemic stroke. Just anted you to know the name for it.
Aspirin and other platelet inhibitors are usually effective in preventing ischemic strokes but such meds will increase the likelihood of another hemorrhagic stroke. So while low-dose aspirin will address that specific ischemic event no doctor will recommend it if you’ve have a history of hemorrhagic stroke. And don’t think of these meds as “blood thinners”. They don’t “thin” the blood, they slow platelet aggregation."
a3231ae0,Do vegetarians and vegans have a higher risk of stroke?,"They found that the prevalence of diabetes increased incrementally across these groups, from vegans having the lowest (2.9%), followed by lacto-ovo-vegetarians (3.2%), pesco-vegetarians (4.8%), semi-vegetarians (6.1%), and non-vegetarians (7.6%).
Worldwide, diabetes has increased steadily and in recent years, drastically. The majority of diabetes cases are type 2 (T2DM), caused by modifiable risk factors such as diet. Vegetarian diets have been studied over the past few decades for their preventative and therapeutic effects on diabetes and may be more beneficial than medication for diabetes management.
Vegetarian diets are inversely associated with risk of developing diabetes independent of the positive association of meat consumption with diabetes development. Vegetarian diets range from vegan (no animal products), lacto-ovo-vegetarian (no animal meat, but consumes milk and eggs), pesco-vegetarian (consumes fish), and semi-vegetarian (occasional meat consumption). There has been an observed difference in the extent of preventative and therapeutic effects of these different types of diets. The most important aspect of any of these types of diets is emphasizing whole grains, fruits and vegetables, legumes, and nuts and reducing saturated and trans fats.

b58703bb,"If you were obese but then lost the weight, are you still more at risk to die of a heart attack, stroke, etc?","It depends upon the reason for the obesity. If you had used eating as a coping habit to manage the sort of stress, which is due to aggravation, irritation and/or anger, then you will have conditions in your body that lead to heart attacks and strokes. Loosing weight will not reduce these to a safe level or health, especially if the stress is still current.
I have explained the matter due to heart attacks and stress here: Kyrani Eade's answer to Why is heart disease the # 1 cause of death worldwide?
The key risk factor is stress so address any stress conditions by resolving issues through reason and action and not through any coping habits. And begin a meditation schedule. Start with just a few minutes a day. And as you go you will find you will want to meditate longer. Thus you can extend your meditation. Meditation will give your body a block of time to return to resting conditions, which is essential for health.
I would also recommend that you begin to live your life mindfully. This is practical meditation. Be present with what you are doing. Avoid thought trains. And keep a thought journal. This will highlight any ideas that are recurrent and which may be pointers to problems."

Please read this overview Stroke
Prevention: Managing Modifiable
Risk
Factors
High blood pressure, high serum lipids and smoking are the greatest risk factors for stroke.
At present about 50% of the risks for developing a stroke are amenable to treatment of the risk factors.
Controlling hypertension lowers one's risk for having a stroke by 32%.
Taking a statin against high serum lipids lowers the risk for having a stroke by between 27 - 35%.
Smoking doubles the risk for developing a stroke.
Having a common and often undiagnosed arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation ups the risk for stroke by 5 times, and can be well treated by using anti-coagulation (blood thinning) although there are appreciable side effects mainly bleeding in 3.4% of those treated.
Obesity is linked to stroke too, each 5 kg/m2 BMI increases the risk for stroke by 40%.
In the last decades, in the developed world we see a decline in the incidence of stroke, due to better blood pressure control and smoking cessation.
These are numbers over time from the US Medicare population:
Conversely, in the developing world, which for the last decades has been targeted by the big tobacco companies, we see a 100% increase of stroke incidence, since beside the targetting of poor people by the tobacco comapnies, e.g. selling cigarettes per piece instead of per package, many people are now able to afford smoking, the growing obesity epidemic, also a problem in developing countries, is causing more people to suffer from high blood pressure and diabetes, very often either not diagnosed so not treated, ofrdiagnosed by badly treated if at all, two important risk factors for having a stroke."

bd805c8c,"My 87-year-old grandfather is hesitant to receive the COVID vaccine. He has a history of strokes, diabetes, a-fib, and congestive heart failure. Are there any risks of him getting vaccinated?","Best to ask his doctor. Every kind of shot/medicine carries some risk.
However, the fact is that should he get Covid-19, his chances of a poor outcome are extremely high, higher than 1 in 10. Covid itself not only goes for the lungs but is a vascular disease causing blood clots and strokes. If he is already prone to the latter, he is in even more danger from the virus which causes 1 blood clot in 350 people."
44aab5c5,Does strength training lower the risk of a stroke?,"Yes I believe the risk of stroke, heart attack, diabetes and cancer are all reduced by doing as little as 3 hours a week of fairly light high intensity weight lifting.
These benefits are mostly achieved by increased muscle mass. This relieves pressure on the artery's by allowing the increased blood flow a greater area.
The increased blood flow enables nutrients to circulate more freely.
Exercise also slows down bone loss in the elderly and if done relatively heavy can even reverse osteoporosis.
Start slowly. Start very light. Do 3 or 4 hours a week. There's no downside. Only upside."
827af7b6,Why are cancer patients at a higher risk of dying from heart disease and stroke?,"There are a couple answers for this.
1). Cancer is largely a disease of aging. So are the two co-morbidities mentioned above. Often a person has developed cancer while also developing HTN, dyslipidemia, and heart disease.
2). The mechanical process of dying from end-stage cancer is sad. The clotting process goes wonky as the tumor progresses from primary site, to adjacent sites, to tiny tumors carried bodywide in the bloodstream. By late Stage IV cancer, you've got mini-tumors all over your body including your brain, and your body just can't cope."
221691f4,Are migraine sufferers at higher risk of a stroke?,"Disclaimer: I am not a doctor so please ask your doctor if this pertains to your personal health.
People who have migraine with aura have a very tiny increase in their risk of stroke. For that reason women who have migraine with aura should not take combination birth control because the combination birth control can also raise the risk of stroke. Typically the increase in stroke risk is not enough to cause concern.
At one time, researchers thought that there might be a link between the risk of stroke and a increased incidence of PFOs in sufferers of migraines with aura. A PFO is a small hole in the heart that could allow small blood clots to go straight to the brain instead of being filtered through the lungs. It seems that there currently is not evidence to support that hypothesis and I have not seen another hypothesis take its place."

But later in the article it talks about red meat being linked to cancer as if this were are reason to avoid red meat. The thing is that link also comes from an observational study. As far as observational studies go, we have no more reason to claim that red meat is unhealthy than that being vegan is unhealthy.
Observational studies are almost meaningless. All they do is provide hypotheses for further study. (We do know, however, that vegans do not get B12 from their diet and that, without supplementation, they will become seriously ill from this.) All the vegan claims to be a healthy diet come from misunderstanding the value of observational studies."

73cec6c4,Why exactly do older people have a greater risk of heart attack and stroke?,"As people get older they’re more likely to have atrial fibrillation which causes blood clots. If a blood clot blocks an artery in the brain you have a stroke. Untreated high blood pressure can cause a blood vessel in the brain to rupture which can also cause a stroke. Finally, the cardiovascular system just wears our over time. Anything that cuts blood flow to parts of the brain can cause a stroke."

47472d13,Can I take a shower right after waking up? Is there any risk?,She's not wrong Bathing is suspected of causing abrupt changes in blood pressure that induce ischemia in the cerebral blood vessels. This could drive a stroke or heart attack or a cardiac arrest it is recommended that after waking up take about 3–5 minutes before showering. Also when showering wet your legs first instead of head first because we are warm blooded wetting your head first causes body temperature to adjust too quickly. My father experienced a mild stroke a few months ago from constantly showering right after waking up it is not very common but it can happen
8916dff7,What if I’ve stopped taking blood pressure medicine and my blood pressure is still in the normal range of 135/85? Can there still be a risk of stroke?,"I worked with my doctors on blood pressure management. After my stroke, I was put on three different BP medications. I monitored my BP several times every day, logging the results in an ap that charted, trended and color coded my readings. As I became able to walk and cook for myself again, my BP began to drop. My doctors were delighted, but they did not reduce my medications.
After a procedure that required sedation, the neurologist took me off one medication because they had trouble keeping my BP up while I was sedated. I continued monitoring my BP and most of the readings continued to be reasonable. Several months later, my neurologist did another endoscopic procedure and again my BP tended to dip lower than he liked while I was sedated. So he discontinued another medication. As before, I continued to monitor and log my BP an all was fine.
A year or so later, I was walking up to an hour every day(!) and my BP was frequently dropping below 90/60. My primary care doctor began to decrease the dosage of the third BP medication over a six month period before discontinuing it entirely.
I was without BP meds for almost two years, but then I broke a leg and was both in serious pain and laid up for several weeks. My BP rose to 160/88 then to 170/93. I emailed the charts and logs of my BP readings and did a telehealth appointment with my primary care doctor. I asked if I should resume BP medications. She said yes and out me on a very low dose of one medication. Now that my leg is healing and I’m starting to be able to walk again, my BP is dropping, but it is still not too low.
I’m continuing to monitor it about three times every day, logging and charting the results. I send the chart to my doc once a month. She will tell me whether to continue, reduce the dose or discontinue. I will follow her instructions.
Having had a stroke, I really don’t want to risk having another stroke! I’m not taking any risks with my BP. I’m eating the DASH Diet, not smoking, not drinking alcohol and exercising as much as I can. I take the medications as prescribed. Even after four plus years, I share my home BP readings with my doc, who loves the trended charts! She can tell at a glance what is going on and what to do about it. We are partners in caring for my health.
I hope you will monitor your BP frequently and log the results. Share them with your doc and follow their advice.
Please don’t play doctor and fiddle with your meds without medical direction."
219bdd3c,How does physical fitness reduce one's risk of stroke?,It is very important to exercise regularly since it helps the blood circulation flow properly in your whole body and also take supplements that are good for your heart..

5a865958,"If I am at risk for a stroke due to oral contraceptives what other option do I have if the IUD, the implant, the patch, etc. all contain hormones?","Wow. My original answer was collapsed due to downvotes, due to a lack of understanding of what NFP is and does. Please be aware that modern methods of natural family planning or fertility awareness are absolutely nothing like the old rhythm method. Rhythm depends on future cycles being like past cycles, which is no good for a lot of women. Modern NFP means charting your fertile symptoms as they happen. We do NOT recommend using barriers during the fertile period, because that means trusting a condom/cervical cap/diaphragm on the days that you are most likely to get pregnant. Why do the work of learning when you are fertile and then taking the greatest risk with the least reliable contraceptive?
Another thing to keep in mind is that while NFP requires a lot of abstinence for some women, for others it doesn’t. A given woman won’t know if she has an easy cycle or not unless she charts for a month or two. I took the pill for four miserable years before quitting and finding out that I am fertile for all of 4–6 days per month. If only I had known!
The June 1998 issue of Journal of Reproductive Medicine reports a study of 1800 couples and cites the effectiveness rates in my original answer.
Natural family planning. Depending on how seriously you need to avoid pregnancy and how obvious your biomarkers are, you could use a simple method like Family of the Americas (98% effective), or a more medicalized version like Creighton Model FertilityCare (99.5% effective)."

16b81727,Is it definitely the case that the aim should be to lower LDL cholesterol as it is a risk factor for strokes?,"Is LDL a risk factor for strokes? Saturated fat is associated with a reduced risk of strokes, and is generally believed to increase LDL, and higher LDL is associated with lower mortality in the elderly - which is when most stroke deaths occur.
LDL can be a risk factor for atherosclerotic and thrombotic cardiovascular disease in general, but is not a very strong one, and it seems to be protective for ischaemic stroke..
The reason for this is likely that the LDL count can be raised by divergent processes, some of which are harmful, some of which are not. LDL can participate in reverse cholesterol transport, and elevated levels in this state are less likely to be harmful than the same levels (or even much lower levels) in a state of lipid accumulation due to excess insulin (hyperinsulinaemia).
This is why the TG/HDL ratio, the HDL level, the non-HDL/HDL ratio, and the HOMA-IR test of insulin sensitivity are all considered more reliable predictors of CVD than LDL cholesterol - they give some idea of where any excess cholesterol on LDL is headed. For example, statins lower LDL but are not beneficial, and may even be harmful, in people who already have a high HDL level and high reverse cholesterol transport activity.
Fruits and vegetables are also protective for stroke, probably due to helping prevent deficiencies of vitamins and minerals and supplying some extra antioxidants.

ef9a87b9,Do pregnancy complications up later stroke risk?,
0b5de922,How common is it for a stroke in an otherwise healthy young person to be associated with drug use? Which drugs increase the risk of stroke?,"Cocaine, methamphetamines, and other stimulants can cause stroke in two ways. To begin with, stimulant drugs increase blood pressure. These drugs also have a direct effect on the vessel walls, and the extra pressure can cause them to rupture and leak blood into the brain. This is known as a hemorrhagic stroke. Secondly, stimulant street drugs narrow the blood vessels. This can cut off blood flow to parts of the brain and kill brain tissue, producing what is known as an ischemic stroke.
Most deaths due to cardiac arrest are in older adults, particularly those with coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in young athletes, but the incidence of it is unclear. Perhaps 1 in every 50,000 sudden cardiac deaths a year occurs in young athletes."

Clearly, it didn’t work.
He came back with symptoms that suggested anxiety.
And then we found out the reason.
His father and uncle had suffered from heart attack at age 50. One uncle had bypass surgery at age 52. Another uncle died suddenly at night, presumably of an heart attack. His grandfather had stroke.
A larger dose of encouragement and placebo did not do any good.
He came back again and again, forcing us to do a ‘64-slice-CT-Angio’ which also turned out to be normal.

Gene and Environment
A strong family history of heart attacks, even in the absence of other risk factors makes the person more susceptible to a heart attack.
It is not just genes that matter, family members tend to share the same environment; the same diet, the same laziness to exercise; the appreciation of the chubby look, the same callous attitude to medical checkup; also has a large supply of prescription medications.
In contrast, a family that exercises regularly, eat healthy; laugh together and remain healthy.

Proof
‘Pima Indians’ living in Arizona, has one of the highest prevalence of Diabetes – roughly 40% of the population have Diabetes.
A small group of Pima Indians are also found in the mountainous region of Sierra Nevada of Mexico. Many believe that the Arizona Pima are those who migrated north for better pastures.
Studies confirmed that both Mexican and American Pima’s are genetically similar. It was not surprising. But what was surprising was this
While US Pimas had a diabetic prevalence of 40%, the Mexican Pimas had diabetes in only 7% people.
Red Circle - Mexican Pima
Red Arrow - American Pima
The reason ?
Hard working Mexican Pima
The Mexican Pima do hard manual work in the field, toiling whole day while the American ones got a headstart with mechanical transport, formal education, fast food and modern lifestyle; unboxing a latent ‘genetic’ diabetes.
The gene was quarantined for good in the Mexicans by hard work and a rustic lifestyle.
A gene is a manual, a instructional code written deep inside your cell. How it expresses is determined, in a large way, by the environment you live in, the way you carry yourself.
You can shove the code book in the attic; or let it auto-pilot your life.

Chief among these being B12 complex, and even then, B12 deficiency is not necessarily the CAUSE of this increased risk.
I am a vegan, and I take B12 supplements because the vegan diet does not naturally contain B12. Anyone that tries to make huge dietary changes with zero prior research, is an idiot.

The actual study is here: Sugar- and Artificially Sweetened Beverages and the Risks of Incident

.
This is a potentially interesting result from a very preliminary study. As the second Guardian article points out:
“We are unable to determine whether artificially sweetened soft drink intake increased the risk of incident dementia through diabetes mellitus or whether people with diabetes mellitus were simply more likely to consume diet beverages.”
Among the many potential sources of confounders is the fact that the study relies on self-reporting of consumption, a notoriously error prone method.
All they really claim is that they observed a correlation, and that further study is merited. That may indeed be the case. But don’t make your health decisions based on a single, preliminary study. The wise course is to wait for a consensus to develop after more and better research.
But it would also be much smarter to ask an actual scientist rather than me. I’m not an authority on any of the fields involved. I have merely learned from real scientists how to approach publications with caution.

With the changes in the climate, wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense. Wildfires produce smoke which produces tiny particles that can travel through the lungs into the bloodstream. Particle pollution can cause asthma, strokes, and even lung cancer."

FDA strengthens warning that NSAIDs increase heart attack and
stroke
risk
- Harvard Health Blog
Regarding thrombotic stroke, this can be related to the stickiness of platelets. These contain enzymes (the COX enzymes) which make chemicals which affect platelet aggregation. The substrates for these enzymes are fatty acids, and eating omega-3 acids makes for less active chemicals than omega-6, which is why those oils seem to be heart protective. Re: medications, NSAIDS inhibit COX; the result of this depends on the balance of inhibition. Aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor and makes the platelets net less sticky, but other methods of inhibition can swing the balance the other way. This is in fact what happened with Vioxx (which stayed on the market too long in part because researchers covered up heart risks in a major NEJM trial). When we investigated, we found other NSAIDS carry these same risks—most commonly reported for heart attack, but also for stroke, which can have the same exact pathogenesis, although strokes can also be from bleeding or from emboli—clots floating from elsewhere.
The link gives some advice on avoiding adverse effects but you have to consider them in context. For example, my heart attack risk in the next 5–10 years is about zero. If I increase that by a fraction, it’s still zero (rate ratio for diclofenac was 1.4, for ibuprofen 1.44 but not statistically significant, for naproxen 0.93 and also not statistically significant). I can take NSAIDS. If you have more risk factors, then the risk may be more measurable. Of course no one should take drugs they don’t need, so you have to weigh the risks and benefits. Also, you could preferentially take aspirin and possibly naproxen, which may be safer, and use some tylenol to reduce your NSAID dose or take it intermittently.
But if you’re focused on bleeding in the brain, that’d be a very rare complication of NSAID therapy. Worry more about thrombotic stroke from an NAIDS, but expect a bleeding complication in the stomach before in the brain (even with a ppi) or hypertension or fluid retention or a kidney side effect. Maybe you can figure out what’s driving your headaches and avoid it. In the meantime maybe this will be reassuring:

The main cause of an ischemic or embolic stroke is the Standard American Diet, which is low in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants but high in inflammatory animal products and refined/processed foods. This leads to inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune dysfunction that promote vascular damage. Strokes are associated with diseases that are a result of poor diet such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. Tobacco use and a sedentary lifestyle also contribute to stroke risk. Hemorrhagic strokes have a different constellation of risks, including salt, medications, and alcohol use and a low cholesterol level versus a high cholesterol level for ischemic stroke.

This question does not sound right, but I looked into it anyway. All I've been able to confirm is that China is currently experiencing a smog crisis:
https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/world/asia/china-air-pollution-smog-climate-change.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FAir%20Pollution&action=click&contentCollection=science&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=9&pgtype=collection&referer=https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/air-pollution
New York City does not have smog. It might not even be possible to have smog in New York as it is a coastal city and is not located in a valley. I don't expect New York City air quality to hold a candle to the Yukon, but comparing it to a region currently experiencing an air quality crisis does not make sense.
I'm unaware of any correlation between being a New Yorker and suffering a stroke, but for good measure, here is a list of the highest risk factors for stroke:

2ee03cc2,Had a CT scan of the head as I was suspected of a stroke - numbing & weakness below the eye. I asked about radiation/risk & was told the delivered dose was approx 1000 milligray. Webssays brain CT is only 2 millicevert. Which is correct & the risks?,"To start with, you should never had the CT scan because it misses 90% of all brain strokes. A 90 seconds MRI examination will detect 99% of strokes.
1000 mGy is the real dose which is known as DLP, that what really penetrated your head and burnt an image on the detectors by changing the molecular structures of the detectors. Unfortunately radiation also changed millions of your molecular structures.
the 2 mSv is a hypothetical figure. It is concept that has never been proven to be scientifically measurable using a device.
It is like saying I am going to turn a machine gun with one thousand bullets at you, that will penetrate your head and they will all come out from the other side of your head. However only 2 of those are dangerous.
Risks are: cancer, Early Dementia, and Neurological diseases.
Sorry for the bad news but that can be found in Radiobiology books and there are hundreds of publications that no practice or hospital want you to be aware off, otherwise they will go out of business"
ec302274,Are there tests to determine if you have risks of having a stroke/heart attack/etc. in the coming weeks or months?,"Great question! Short answer is “yes”, long answer “no, with a but…”
We’ll address the basic stuff first. Strokes are either due to a blockage of one or more essential vessels in the brain (called an ischaemic stroke), or due to a bleed in the brain from those vessels (haemorrhagic stroke). Ischaemic strokes are far more common because they’re caused by very common pathologies - either due to a blood clot because someone has something like an irregular heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation), or due to something like atherosclerotic plaques firing into the brain from the carotid arteries in the neck. Haemorrhagic strokes are less common but can occur as a result of things like high blood pressure, previous strokes, or unusual structural abnormalities.
We have good scoring systems for risk of ischaemic stroke, such as after a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (one example would be the CHA2DS2-VASc
score). Sometimes people have mini-strokes (transient ischaemic attacks which resolve fully within 24h, usually less). In those cases you can predict the likelihood of future ischaemic stroke with the ABCD2
score. There are other scores for haemorrhagic strokes such as the HEMORR₂HAGES
score for people who are on warfarin - an anticoagulant.
Time for the “no, with a but”: no score can accurately assess your absolute chance of having a stroke, but they do point you in the right direction. They help you assess the relative risk compared to others in a population.
The same applies to cardiac risks of heart attack. One popular score used by GPs in the UK is the QRISK3
score - which looks at lots of factors such as whether you’re a smoker, diabetic, your blood pressure, medications and so on. I’m sure there are other validated tests internationally too.
Most of these tests (both for stroke and MI) don’t assess risk over a specific time frame (ABCD2 is the odd one out, as it’s risk up to 3 months). But it’s safe to say that if you are scoring highly on these tests, it does mean you’re at an increased risk and you should take action to reduce your risk factors. For both stroke and heart disease, this means stopping smoking, reducing your blood pressure and maintaining a healthy, balanced diet. And everyone’s favourite: moderate exercise!"
95509326,"What other risk factors are there for stroke other than smoking, drinking, and obesity?","All three are the reasons of strike for a human if we use it in excess. Smoking and drinking causes of obesity also. 70 to 80% peoples are obese in the world. The main causes of obesity with a bad lifestyle and bad habits in food. Obesity is the condition in which a person has more fat on his body. Obesity can make cause os many diseases. Drinking is a bad habit but it is helpful for anyone in limited quantity. It relief from pain and mental stress and make a source of entertainment. Beer, whiskey, brandy, rum, a wine has their different benefits for a person. And now comes to the smoking, it is a very bad habit because you can't quit smoking easily and it can make the reason for cancer also. Smoking gives 5 to 10 minutes of mental relaxation for smokers. It effects in active and passive smoking both types. If we talk about the stroke, we can say that drinking and smoking in excess can make the reason for obesity and obesity and drinking can make the main reason of stroke."
6efe1f45,Is it true that daytime napping once or twice a week could lower the risk of heart attacks or strokes?,"A daytime nap taken once or twice a week may lower the risk of having a heart attack/stroke, finds research published online in the journal Heart.
But no such association emerged for either greater frequency or duration of naps.
In this study occasional napping, once to twice weekly, was associated with an almost halving in attack/stroke/heart failure risk (48%) compared with those who didn't nap at all.
This is an observational study, and as such, can't establish cause, added to which the information on nap and sleep patterns relied on personal recall.
But nap frequency may help to explain the differing conclusions reached by researchers about the impact of napping on heart health, suggest the study authors.
And they conclude: ""The study of napping is a challenging but also a promising field with potentially significant public health implications. While there remain more questions than answers, it is time to start unveiling the power of naps for a supercharged heart.""

Instead it may be because some children tend to adopt a lifestyle and diet that matches the unhealthy example set by their parents.
The risk of stroke is minimized by following a low stress healthy lifestyle and diet starting from the earliest possible age before much vascular damage may have already taken place due to unhealthy living practices."

cd377220,"How can someone in their early 50's, who have been pretty much inactive for the last 20 years, get into shape without risking a heart attack or stroke? Include a simple regimen and diet.","The simplest and safest is to start walking. But just walking without monitoring your heart rate will be meaningless. So you need an accurate heart rate device. The best is a chest strap that can connect to a monitor (wrist watch?) that alerts you when a certain heart rate level is reached.
Next you move around as usual and note the highest HR reading over a few days. Take the average.
Use a time duration to say 30 minutes. This will not cause too much DOMS if you don't normally walk for more than 10 minutes non stop. Set the alert at 10 bpm above the average reading you obtained. Then just walk normally. If the alert level is not reached after 10 minutes, you are walking too slow. Just increase your pace a bit until the alert is given. Or you can read the level on your wrist device occasionally. Try to maintain a pace just below the alert level. Note how your body feels. Any chest pain? Are you just breathing hard? Any pain anywhere? Any yes to the above means that you MUST STOP IMMEDIATELY. You should be feeling leg muscle burn at most. Maybe a bit of sweat coming out. Too much sweating, or cold sweating is the signal to also stop immediately. If all signs are good, you can continue to walk.
If you have DOMS the next day, rest until no more aches.
Repeat the walking sessions daily for a week or two. If you find that it just feels like a stroll in the park, then you are ready for a 5 beat increase. Just repeat the 5 beats increase every week until you have to walk at about 4 mph to get the last increased level of alert. The 5 beats increment is just an example. Use a lower or higher number depending on how your body adapted.
Then you can increase the time to an hour and continue the walking sessions at the last heart rate level set. Two things can happen. The alert may start before the hour is reached. Ignore it and just switch off the alert for the next session. Or you will feel leg burning towards the end. If so just reduce the pace.Eventually you will be able to walk at 4 mph for an hour without feeling leg burn. That is as far as you can go just doing walking as the exercise.
The above will improve your walking endurance as well as improving your heart efficiency and health to a certain extent.
If you want other forms of endurance, then you have to do the specific exercise. Running, cycling, swimming, etc. Start at maybe 10 or 20 beats lower than that of your last walking session. It will allow the body to adapt to the new muscle movement.
Do the same as the walking above, only your heart rate will eventually increase to around 40 beats higher than the highest during your walking sessions. By that time, your resting heart rate will have dropped by more than 10%. You will have achieved a good level of heart efficiency and health.
The next thing to do is doing HIIT in the exercise that you were doing. This is to adapt the heart to sudden increase in heart rate and improve your heart's FITNESS level. That means that you recover faster from a high heart rate. Do this sparingly. Once a week is sufficient. You will be reaching max heart. That is why I say once weekly is enough. Why overstress the heart?
One last point on the cardiovascular part. You only need to do it once a week for maintenance. Your cardiovascular efficiency and health will not change much.
The strength part of getting into shape, I leave it to others to answer."

Underlying pathology for coronary artery disease is atherosclerosis, that causes heart attack and ischaemic stroke. High blood pressure is the leading cause of haemorrhagic stroke.
So, this question is stemming from the EPIC-Oxford study recently published in BMJ.
This study reported increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke, (not ischaemic stroke) with vegans/vegetarians. Also, in this study vegetarians had lower blood pressure than meat eaters, largely excluding high BP as the cause. The study is suggesting lack of nutrients (vit D, bit B12) as risk factors in vegetarian diet.
My take on the study: the groups were divided according to whether they were eating meat, fish or were vegans/vegetarians. No assessment was done with respect to the type of foods consumed in each group. A vegetarian largely consuming whole foods made at home would have an entirely different risk profile than a person consuming large amounts of processed food. This largely limits the significance of the increased stroke finding in vegetarian group.
How to translate to your life: largely consuming plant-based whole foods and keeping processed foods to the minimum is still the safest approach."

Plus most of the people suffering Covid-19 related strokes that occurred in the COVID-19 patients were generally confined to older patients—the median age was 69—and patients with known stroke risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. The stroke patients tended to have more severe COVID-19 disease, and on average had much worse signs of inflammation and clot risk on blood tests."

But not everybody is aware of the opposite circumstance referred to as masked hypertension, where the BP measurements are normal in the office but high much of the rest of the time. This is harder to diagnose unless BP measurements are obtained outside of the doctor’s office by using a patient's own home cuff, a cuff available at a pharmacy, or with a 24-hour BP study called ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Masked hypertension has a much higher risk to patients, so it’s always important for people to have a good idea of what their BP is when they aren’t visiting the doctor."

Genetics in that a gene can be turned on or off and their siblings can be different since it is a switch and can be turned on/off nearly randomly. Hereditary when passed on by parents, grandparents (sometime skips a generation depending on type of gene or whether a dominant/recessive trait). Some people have a high toleration for some inflammatory foods/edibles and others are particularly sensitive to some substances. If you have some tissue that reacts to a substance and is weakened then it becomes easier for something else to penetrate the tissue and cause problems until it reaches a point that it dislodges and gets stuck somewhere else. Example is when cholesterol penetrates a weakened wall of an artery due to inflammation, changes form over time, then penetrates back into the artery and converts into a blood clot, which then gets stuck in a narrow passage. So avoiding inflammatory food should, theoretically, reduce the likelihood of this happening or reduce it to fewer incidences."
17879336,"When someone has a pediatric stroke, does it increase the probability/risk of having more throughout their life?","People tend to perceive stroke as an adult problem and tend to be blindsided when their child has a stroke. If you are someone who has had a pediatric stroke, you may find it difficult to find the answers you are seeking. I'm going to assume that you would appreciate a more impowering answer than if there will be a dark cloud hanging over you or your child for the rest of your life as you wait for another one to occur. The short, but unsatisfying answer, is that it might increase the risk. The better question is “How do we reduce the risk of having another stroke?”
There are modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for strokes, including pediatric strokes. There are also different types of strokes. I would suggest discussing this with the child's doctors. If there are non-modifiable risk factors, such as a genetic predisposition to strokes, they may recommend medications to reduce the risk of a future stroke. (I would think carefully about “pre-existing conditions” before getting a genetic test done. Even the ones that are being done for genealogical purposes are not well protected. They are selling DNA findings to pharmaceutical companies for research and insurance companies would love to have that data too.)
Reducing modifiable risk factors for stroke is sound advice for everyone. Cigarette smoke increases the risk of stroke so the child should be protected from exposure to cigarette smoke and people vaping nearby. Hormonal birth control and hormone therapy (HRT) also increases risk of developing clots. This is more complicated than avoiding vape and cigarette polluted air. There may be situations where the benefits of hormones may outweigh the risks. It is also beneficial to monitor blood pressure and follow the doctor's recommendations to maximize health. Heart disease and stroke are also closely associated with diabetes. Fatty fish may protect the heart and blood vessels.
So, here is my best advice. 1 Do all that you can to encourage recovery after the stroke. 2 Protect the brain. Wear helmets and seatbelts. Learn about water safety. Don't take up boxing as a hobby. 3 Reduce risk factors for stroke 4 Call 911(US) or go directly to the ER if there is any suspicion of a new stroke. Speedy treatment is so important! 5 Maximize your health. Eat well. Exercise. Breathe clean air. Relax. Love.

Except if you do a significant overdose. The use of Coumadin however with high blood pressure is a stroke asking to happen.
There are two kinds of strokes. 80% are blockage strokes which occur usually in older people due to the gradual buildup of cholesterol plaque in the arteries of the brain. Yet 20% are rupture strokes. These are arteries that rupture and bleed into the brain, and are frequently major problems that result in irreversible damage that if the patient doesn’t die they are left with serious dysfunction.
So with high blood pressure and Coumadin that makes you clot less if there is a bleeding, particularly with a ruptured artery then you are in very serious trouble, and have a high potential for death."

This said that Celecoxib is one of a group of NSAIDs - Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs. This group includes aspirin and other painkillers such as ibuprofen. Until recently, low-dose aspirin was prescribed for people at risk of stroke or heart attack. So by that logic, if anything, it should lower someone’s risk of heart attack or stroke.

4bcaa143,"Should all individuals with diabetes be encouraged to wear medical IDs, given the condition's strong association with the risk of stroke?","If someone has a medical condition that could be life threatening or needs special consideration when receiving medical care, especially in an emergency, then yes, they should have some sort of medical ID. Medical IDs are a great tool for emergency medical responders to use so they know what medications are safe for the patient, if the patient has allergies to medications/metals/latex/etc, and to have an idea of what may have caused the situation in the first place. For example, a diabetic could faint or become unresponsive due to low or high blood sugar, but if the medical responders don't know they're diabetic, it takes longer for them to figure out what is going on, which can be the difference between life and death. Another example is when a person with an Autism Spectrum Disorder gets hurt and doesn't have someone with them, it is helpful for them to have a medical ID so the doctors and nurses know how to interact with them and what additional health issues they may have.
Many people don't where medical ID bracelets or carry cards with them because they don't want to announce to the world their personal health issues, which is understandable. A good alternative is always carrying a notecard with current statistics (height, weight, etc), a medication list, a list of health issues, and emergency contacts so if you are alone and something happens, while they are looking for your ID they will also find your health information. Many phones now have an emergency screen that can be accessed from the lock screen. I know that iPhones definitely have it. You can fill out the information and it will be available on the emergency screen under the Medical ID tab. I find this so useful since the majority of people have smartphones and keep their phones with them at all times.
I honestly think everyone should keep some sort of a medical ID, even if just to have your basic statistics (used for medication dosage) and emergency contacts readily available.
Stay safe and healthy!"

5917e2f8,Do you think that a person with a family history of heart attack and stroke will reduce their risk by donating platelets through apheresis? There has been no personal cardiac event. Would taking Plavix be worth the potential side effects.,"Probably No and No - but read on. There a number of well recognised risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart attack and ischaemic stroke), but a risk factor is a little different from a treatment target. The recommended preventative treatments are those based on prospective clinical studies showing that the treatment (lifestyle or medical) achieves the desired outcome - as measured by a reduced risk of a clinical measurement (reduction in death/stroke/heart attack), not by a change in a de facto risk marker (e.g. BP, blood sugar or cholesterol level). So the things that reduce risk are healthy diet (yes, moderate alcohol intake is OK), regular exercise, avoiding smoking, treating high BP … and if you are at high risk, statin medication and aspirin. Of relevance statins have been thought of as cholesterol lowering drugs and therefore that any benefit is related to this effect. naturally many people assume that and cholesterol lowering will be beneficial, and therefore the modest effect of platelet apheresis ‘might’ have a small benefit. It turns out however that statins have lots of effect unrelated to the change in blood cholesterol levels that are probably important for their long term benefit, and other ways of cholesterol lowering probably don’t have these benefits. So great that you’re a platelet donor, but any CV risk reduction is likely to be minimal. Best to address the other treatable risk factors. With regard to Plavix/clopidogrel, we know that if you have a moderate-high CV risk, then low dose aspirin has a small benefit. It also has a small bleeding risk, so you need to have a high enough CV risk for the total benefit to outweigh the bleeding concern. And aspirin has been shown to have other benefits, such as reducing the likelihood of dying form bowel cancer (probably because the dangerous polyps are detected and treated at an earlier stage). So obviously people might assume theat the same benefit would exist for clopidogrel. And maybe it does, but we can’t be sure without a specific study. So my suggestion is to look at your overall risk profile - there are plenty of on line calculators (e.g. Framingham Coronary Heart Disease
Risk
Score
). Then maybe ‘add a bit’ for your family history - this is not usually included in these calculators, as too hard to quantify (e.g. t depends so much on the age and the number of your first degree relatives that have had CV events, whether they were smokers, and whether any strokes were ischaemia or bleeds…just to name a few issues). Lifestyle factors are always worth treating, and depending on your personal risk profile/calculation think about a statin and/or aspirin. If you can’t tolerate aspirin (very cheap), but are high risk, then maybe the cost of clopidogrel could be justified (I’m doubtful). I hope this helps you think about things."
8bbe9260,Is it true that taking aspirin daily does not lower your risk for heart attack or stroke?,"You've actually asked the wrong question if you're interested in recent news. The question is one of balance. Even taking a single 81 mg aspirin tablet per day is associated with a risk of major GI bleeding. It does you little good to prevent a heart attack if you bleed to death instead.
And of course the risk of a fatal heart attack is a tad higher in an older man who smokes, whose blood pressure and LDL cholesterol are both high, and who's had a previous heart attack than the risk in a young healthy woman with none of those risk factors. Likewise, different people have different levels of risk for bleeding.
What you want to know isn't some generality but rather your individual risk of dying from a heart attack or stroke is greater or less than your risk of death from pooping out your life's blood (and I mean that quite literally).
It's actually a little more complicated than that, but the real point is that different people are different, and you need to ask the right person (your doctor) the right questions."

Hardened or blocked arteries is called Arteriosclerosis or Atherosclerosis. The blockages are called plaque buildup, and if they break off they can cause clotting.
Clotting can lead to blocking blood flow, which can lead to heart attack or stroke. If the blockage occurs in the arteries leading to your brain, you may experience TIAs which may progress to stroke.
So, long story short, yes.

Second, the use of aspirin for primary prevention of heart issues is rather dubious itself.

Major heart health guidelines (AHA/ACC, JNC) don't recommend aspirin for primary prevention of heart disease or incident.

cf410408,Why does long term exposure to nitrogen dioxide increase the risk of strokes and atrial fibrillation?,"reference: Molecular mechanisms of nitrogen dioxide induced epithelial injury in the lung - PubMed
Not sure exactly why. But, here’s what I think.
NO2 is an acidic oxide that generate nitric acid (HNO3) when it reacts with water.
NO2 is a pretty serious oxidizing agent, and can access multiple oxidation states.
NO2 is a “free radical”; an odd-electron species that exists freely in the gas phase.
The interplay of these three properties of NO2 makes it deadly for physiological systems (cells) that would suffer oxidative stress, curtailment of enzyme action at reduced pH, and also free-radical induced chemical reactions that disrupt biological processes.
I don’t know that anyone has a precise answer on exactly what mechanisms operate with NO2, but very low concentrations (ppb-level) of NO2 in the air we breathe is sufficient to cause serious damage to lung tissue. I am not exactly sure how NO2 affects atrial fibrillation and strokes."

Cholesterol
is manufactured by every animal cell
on the planet.
Why? Because it is an essential structural component of every animal cell on the planet, including for ALL cells of human beings.
What does cholesterol enable animals to do which plants cannot do?
Answer: Rapidly change shape without cell damage, animals to move. Animals can go eat plants, the plants cannot move.
Given then fact, do animals, including humans absorb lots of cholesterol from food?
Answer: No! A basic homeostatic mechanisms
required to stay alive.
Since the primary source of all cholesterol in within, would increases in ingestion drive body cholesterol concentrations higher.
Answer: Largely No (beyond small transient increases)!
Given this fact, if cholesterol in body goes up, what happens to internal cholesterol production?
Answer: You guessed it, it goes down to compensate.
Another issue: Does cholesterol have anything to do with artery disease
?
Answer: Largely No! As researched for 2–3 decades before finally figured out and published 1950
; study at least the abstract and notice the date of publication.
Since lipoprotein
s (complex protein particles which transport ALL fats in the water outside cells around our entire body) were identified, 1950, as the most important factor involved in artery disease progression over time, ALWAYS matches event rates over time, why was cholesterol promoted as an alternative (though never correct) concept?
Answer: Money and power while working (pretending?) to pay attention to the correct issues to help people.
Lipoproteins have long been divided into 5 major classes based on density ranges (what the D in HDL & LDL, two of the five classes) compared with the surrounding water.
Additionally, HDL particles have also been divided into 5 major classes and relation to artery disease event rates. On what basis?
Answer: You guessed it, by density, AKA size (an inverse of density)
This is a complex issue.

If, on the other hand the researchers had some marker or blood test that they could use to determine the amount of nuts eaten by each group and found that the group with certain nut eating markers had 17% fewer heart attacks and strokes than the non-nut eating no-marker group, then they could say there was an association, but not a cause and effect relationship. Because we have no knowledge of any other factors that might have made a difference in these two groups. Association is not cause and effect. Now, just to be careful, I would need to read the original research paper to accept or disagree with their methods and conclusions. I say this to caution any reader of scientific research papers to read the paper itself, not just the ay reporting of the results of the paper. A well trained, good science writer can make a simplified report of a research paper that makes sense and is not terribly misleading, but the best is to read and evaluate the paper yourself."

e09b8c33,Why do young adults with PTSD have a higher risk of stroke in the middle age?,"The very thing that is the “root cause” of “PTSD” is also the “root cause” of a higher risk of stroke in middle age in those with long persisting “PTSD”. Anxiety. Anxiety, in one form or another, is deleterious to human physiology on many different ways.
The cause of “PTSD” is a sudden surge of high anxiety caused by the sudden realisation of being in sudden danger, a “mental shock”
“PTSD” is technically an anxiety disorder, and chronically high anxiety is one of its clinical features. Among other things, high anxiety over time increases the likelihood of plaques growing in arteries going to or in the brain increasing the likelihood of the artery either blocking or rupturing.
To get more insight into the patho-physiology (what has gone wrong in the brain as a result of a sudden surge of high anxiety, and what can be done about it) might I suggest reading the web-site < ptsd(dot)net >"
b3ab2975,"Is eating meat, which is high in sulphur amino acids, linked to a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and non-alcohol fatty liver disease?","While a plant-based diet is generally considered healthier than a meat-based diet in preventing the risk of diabetes, not all meats affect the risk equally. As Professor Koh Woon Puay, Professor of Clinical Sciences at Duke-NUS Medical School (Duke-NUS), and her team found out, higher intake of red meat and poultry is associated with significantly increased risk of developing diabetes, which is partially attributed to their higher content of heme iron in these meats. This study provides the basis for evidence-based dietary recommendations to the Singapore population in mitigating diabetes risk and reducing the healthcare burden of this chronic condition.
These findings come from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, which recruited 63,257 adults aged 45-74 years between 1993 and 1998, and then followed them up for an average of about 11 years. The study found a positive association between intakes of red meat and poultry, and risk of developing diabetes. Specifically, compared to those in the lowest quartile intake, those in the highest quartile intake of red meat and poultry had a 23 per cent and 15 per cent increase in risk of diabetes, respectively, while the intake of fish/shellfish was not associated with risk of diabetes. The increase in risk associated with red meat/poultry was reduced by substituting them with fish/shellfish.
In trying to understand the underlying mechanism for the role of red meat and poultry in the development of diabetes, the study also investigated the association between dietary heme-iron content from all meats and the risk of diabetes, and found a dose-dependent positive association. After adjusting for heme-iron content in the diet, the red-meat and diabetes association was still present, suggesting that other chemicals present in red meat could be accountable for the increase in risk of diabetes. Conversely, the association between poultry intake and diabetes risk became null, suggesting that this risk was attributable to the heme-iron content in poultry.
This is one of the largest Asian studies looking at meat consumption and diabetes risk. While the findings are consistent with other Western studies that have shown that the increased intake of red meat and increase in heme-iron content of diet could increase the risk of diabetes, this study demonstrated the additional risk of red meat attributable to other possible chemicals, other than its heme-iron content. It also suggested that chicken parts with lower heme-iron contents such as breast meat, compared to thighs, could be healthier. Finally, the study also demonstrated the benefit of replacing red meat or poultry with fish/shellfish.
Describing the key take home message for the public, senior author of the study Professor Koh said, ""We don't need to remove meat from the diet entirely. Singaporeans just need to reduce the daily intake, especially for red meat, and choose chicken breast and fish/shellfish, or plant-based protein food and dairy products, to reduce the risk of diabetes. At the end of the day, we want to provide the public with information to make evidence-based choices in picking the healthier food to reduce disease risk.""
""Although a number of western studies have consistently shown that red meat consumption should be moderated, this study is highly relevant as it is based on local population and consumption patterns. The findings affirm HPB's recommendation to consume red meat in moderation, and that a healthy and balanced diet should contain sufficient and varied protein sources, including healthier alternatives to red meat such as fish, tofu and legumes,"" said Dr Annie Ling, Director, Policy, Research and Surveillance Division, Health Promotion Board.

e439ee2a,Can energy drinks cause heart attack’s?,"A ‘Heart Attack’ or Myocardial Infarction is caused by a blockage in a Coronary Artery (an artery that feeds oxygenated blood into the heart muscle itself). The area of the heart that the particular blood vessel feeds becomes ischemic (starved of oxygen) and may subsequently become necrotic (dead tissue) if circulation is not restored relatively quickly.
I do not think that energy drinks contain chemicals that could cause a blockage in an artery per se.
I think there is some confusion between a ‘heart attack’ and a cardiac arrest. A cardiac arrest is a situation where the heart is no longer beating in such a manner that it can effectively pump enough blood around the body to sustain life.
There are different types of cardiac arrest which normally have different causes. Some are shockable with a defibrillator and some are not. A ventricular fibrillation (VF) Cardiac Arrest and a Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) Cardiac Arrest are two examples of a shockable cardiac arrest and also the two types which evidence has linked with consumption of energy drinks which contain stimulants like high levels of caffeine or taurine.
Consuming too many stimulants can cause hyper-excitability in the heart muscle, where each cell is responsible for polarising and depolarising in an organised manner. When the cells become over excited, they may ‘fire’ out of sequence causing the heart to go into a dangerous rhythm (or arrhythmia) such as VF or VT.
If the person is also engaged in a sporting activity or some other activity that raises the pulse, the heart muscle is already stimulated by natural hormones and the caffeine or taurine causes additional excitability.
In VF, the cells fire completely out of the normal sequence which causes the heart to quiver rather than beat. The heart is unable to work as a pump and there is insufficient blood flow to sustain life without quick intervention.
In VT, a cell in the lower part of the heart (the ventricles) gets over excited and begins to fire very fast and repeatedly. The other cells near by follow suit and as a result, the heart is often unable to fill with enough blood to pump out around the body to sustain life. Again, this can be fatal without quick intervention.
So in answer to the question; No, energy drinks do not cause heart attacks but evidence suggest that they can contribute to cardiac arrests and subsequent death in some circumstances."

This rant doesn't help you, except that I feel you. All I can advise is find yourself a good doctor who is willing to look a little further than just prescribe birth control. Endometriosis can be treated to some extent, although birth control is the main treatment. Extremely heavy bleeding can be caused by hypothyroidism, it might be worth checking that out. Painful periods can to some extent be caused by a lack of magnesium or other minerals. Oh, and in Germany it is common to prescribe agnucaston for regulating periods, it's some chestnut derived preparation. No idea if it really works."

Tests like PT and PTT are tests of the blood’s ability to clot but are not abnormal in women who are affected by DVT, PE or stroke.
We do know that some women are at higher risk of these complications already and should consider other forms of contraception - women with migraines with aura, women with any type of migraines over the age of 35 and smokers.

stroke
is the most serious form of heat injury and is considered a medical emergency. If you suspect that someone has heat
stroke
-- also known as sunstroke -- call 911 immediately and give first aid
until paramedics arrive.
Heat stroke can kill or cause damage to the brain
and other internal organs. Although heat stroke mainly affects people over age 50, it also takes a toll on healthy young athletes.
Heat stroke
often occurs as a progression from milder heat-related illnesses such as heat cramps
, heat syncope (fainting
), and heat exhaustion
. But it can strike even if you have no previous signs of heat injury.
Heat stroke
results from prolonged exposure to high temperatures -- usually in combination with dehydration
-- which leads to failure of the body's temperature control system. The medical definition of heat stroke
is a core body temperature
greater than 104 degrees Fahrenheit, with complications involving the central nervous system
that occur after exposure to high temperatures. Other common symptoms include nausea

f0a86e48,Is red cell dist.width (in a blood test of CBC) can be considered as an indicator to stroke?,"In response to your excellent question, there appears to be some interesting data that tends to support this concept. By definition,, the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is an employed parameter that represents the differentiation of red blood cell volume and size. (microcytic, macrocytic and normocytic). Results of the test, along with those of other blood tests, can help doctors to confirm the presence of certain anemias, a condition characterized by a lack of red blood cells. The RDW test can additionally determine, in many cases, the underlying source of the anemia. To cite one example, in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, which is differentiated from folate deficiency, an RDW can be revealing. RDW would increase due to the release of immature RBCs in certain blood diseases. RDW tends to increase in iron deficiency anemia, as mean corpuscular volume (MCV) decreases. MCV is the average volume of a red blood cell. However, there is more to this research narrative.-
It has been claimed with some compelling evidence, though not thoroughly conclusive, that RDW had an interesting association to mortality prediction and cardiovascular episodes, such as acute coronary syndromes, ischemic strokes, peripheral arterial disease and hypertension. It is also believed that RDW can be a predictor of mortality in some patients with cancer, renal failure and lung disease. Cerebral infarction (CI) (ischemic stroke, 70% of all strokes)), with cerebral thrombosis, lacunar infarction, cerebral embolism are caused by a brain blood supply disorder of brain lesions. -It should be kept in mind though, that, there is really no direct biological marker to diagnose stroke. RDW might be an available alternative that can narrow the gap.-
In a more direct response to your curious question, current studies confirm that RDW is narrowly related to the occurrence of ischemic strokes. It has been observed that the levels of RDW in these stroke patients was higher than in those without occurring strokes. It is tempting and even logical to assume that RDW assessment plays a principle role in stroke progression, -
Another obvious question is how is RDW related to these mechanisms, and what exactly is causing these changes? The RDW biological mechanism between ischemic strokes and RDW is still a bit vague. There are many unanswered questions. Inflammation and oxidative stress (imbalance between the cell and its ability to rid itself of toxic metabolites), may play an important part in this dilemma. Inflammation lessens the survival ability of RBCs and causes cellular damage. Other studies say that RDW was associated with tumor necrosis factor receptors or C reactive proteins, and other inflammatory mediators, which are all inflammation markers.-
In conclusion, though, RDW thinly appears to be a predictor for mortality and ischemic stroke risk, though its mechanisms remain unclear. Inflammation as well appears to be a respected player in this pathological equation. Many of these research findings originate from a mixture number of independent studies (meta analyses). There is no doubt, that regarding this topic, we have glimpsed only the tip of the iceberg. WE must, and should consider the importance and relevance of all the other findings and observations before rushing to half baked conclusions. Let us continue to research, learn and properly heal, whenever we can.-"

fc95d384,"If I have red spots after vomiting (petechia), does that mean my vessels are weak and I am more at risk for a stroke?","I would advice you to visit a physician as soon as possible.
Petechiae can be due to several causes. As you've mentioned capillary fragility can be a cause , but it's most commonly caused by platelet abnormality be it functional or depletion of platelet."
42b26fd2,"In a death tournament with Batman’s death stroke, Damien Wayne, Robin, Red Hood, Red Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Batwoman, Heretic Raes al Ghoul, Lady Shiva and Bronze Tiger, how would it go and who will win?","I don’t really understand the “Batman’s death stroke” and “Heretic Raes al Ghoul”, I am not doing to include Batman but I will do Deathstroke and I will include both Heretic and Ra’s al Ghul. I am doing to use Damian Wayne as Robin because in my eyes, I only really see four Robins and three is already on this list. I don’t know who is the Batgirl but I will use Barbara Gordon, just because reasons.
So Deathstroke vs Damian Wayne vs Red Hood vs Red Robin vs Nightwing vs Batgirl vs Batwoman, Heretic and Ra’s al Ghul, Lady Shiva and Bronze Tiger.
So first thing first I will take Batgirl out, just because I believe Deathstroke, Bronze Tiger, Lady Shiva, Red Hood, Nightwing, Red Robin and Heretic can take her out. And while she is highly intelligent, when you are in a death tournament, you can’t just sit down a plan. Damian Wayne probaby can’t defeat her but he does have a chance as he is train from both. I believe Red Robin can defeat her because he started his train when he was way younger. Batwoman could “defeat” as she have done so in Batgirl Vol 4 12.
Next Batwoman will go down, just because usually her advantage is that she kills but now they are in a death tournament so she no longer gets this. Deathstroke, Red Hood, Nightwing, Heretic, Ra’s al Ghul, Lady Shiva and Bronze Tiger. Damian will have difficult with her but I do believe he can win as he is trained young and have is suppose to be “perfect”. I see Red Robin being smarter and will think of a way out of this.
Then I would say Damian Wayne is down, just because he is not as skilled and some more. He can be defeated by Deathstroke, When ever Robin is fighting Red Hood, Jason is not even looking for a fight, but one of a “out fight”, Red Hood wins. In Teen Titans Annual Vol 6 1
And this is what happen when Red Robin goes “all out” in Red Robin Vol 1 14
And forget when the New 52 movies say, Nightwing can beat Damian even without trying. In Batman Vol 1 688
In Batman Incorporated Vol 2 8, Heretic can defeat Damian
I can see Ra's al Ghul, Lady Shiva and Bronze Tiger beating Damian in a a death tournament.
For a refresh, now there is Deathstroke, Red Hood, Red Robin, Nightwing, Heretic, Ra’s al Ghul, Lady Shiva, and Bronze Tiger left standing.
When all of them, Heretic can go now. I believe that Deathstroke, Ra’s al Ghul, Lady Shiva, and Bronze Tiger defeat. As Deathstroke can fight a god, Ra’s have been around for a long time, Lady Shiva is the best of the best and Bronze Tiger is also good. While Damian might fail against in Batman Incorporated Vol 2 8
I believe Red Hood, Red Robin and Nightwing is better than Damain Wayne.
I would say Bronze Tiger goes out next. Deathstroke can take him, even though Bronze Tiger is more skilled, Slade has his ability and can use 90% of his brain. I also don’t really count Deathstroke the Hunted Vol 1 41 but if you do, good for you.
I can see Jason beating Ben. Just cause Red Hood is more violent, in a way, and Red Hood is also very skilled as he is train by Batman, Nightwing, Bronze Tiger, Lady Shiva and the All-Caste. I believe he is smarter than Been. In Outlaws Vol 1 26, they did fight but it is good to keep in mind that in that issue Red Hood is not at his peak.
Red Robin while may not be more skill, he is smarter in many ways. Bronze Tiger can be probably be defeated by Nightwing with difficulty. In Grayson Vol 1 18
While Bronze Tiger is good, Ra’s al Ghul have been around for a long time. and Bronze Tiger have said that Lady Shiva is better than him. In Batgirl Vol 1 67.
Not Ben is not to be taken lightly as he is very skill with Chi Manipulation.
I will have to say that Red Robin have to go now. While, he is great at thinking and fighting, he might not be able to live though this death tournament. Deathstroke already can defeat him in Teen Titans Vol 3 4
Red Hood already fight Tim and win a few times before and one of those times is in Teen Titans Vol 3 29
Nightwing will be able to beat Tim Drake, and they did fight in Nightwing Vol 2 139. It should be said that they both (Tim more) are not in the best of place. But you can see that Nightwing is not looking for a fight and is winning.
While, Red Robin can out smart Ra’s, he did it with planing but with the same reason as Barbara, he can’t just think. And Ra’s should be skilled enough to defeat Tim. In Red Robin Issue 12
While Red Robin did win aganist Lady Shiva
But if you think about Lady Shiva is not stupid and she won’t be falling for tricks, that is if Tim have time to plan against her with so many people.
Lady Shiva is good but I believe it is time for her to go. While she is good, Deathstroke has enhanced everything. And don’t believe the movie, Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons
In Outlaws Vol 1 26, Jason was was able to fight against Lady Shiva
And while in Nightwing Vol 3 14, Lady Shiva did win, Nightwing was already injure before the fight, on top of that Nightwing did not even really use any of his weapons, besides the Escrima Sticks and two of his wingdings.
But Nightwing can land attack her still even if Lady Shiva can read his body language. Nightwing is suppose to be a unpredictable fighter and that’s what help him survive against Midnighter in Grayson Vol 1 6
Ra’s al Ghul have been around this earth the longest of everyone here. He have the most experience, he also have the Lazarus Enhancement, which help a lot in places like his strength, speed, stamina, agility, and durability. He can take on Batman, something Lady Shiva can’t really do.
The next person I will dismiss will be Ra’s al Ghul. Deasthstroke is better but not by a lot, while Ra’s al Ghul is the better fighter. In Deathstroke Vol 3 20, Deathstroke did seems like losing but I don’t believe he was in the right mind
So Ra’s al Ghul have a pretty big chance of winning but I am pretty sure that Deathstroke is stronger, faster, and smarter.
Red Hood have defeat Ra’s al Ghul before in Outlaws Vol 1 27
Nightwing have defeated him in Nightwing Vol 2 152
So now down to three; Deathstroke vs Red Hood vs Nightwing.
Nightwing will now met his death because when you can comparing Deathstroke, Red Hood and Nightwing and ask who is the worst at killing, the answer will be Nightwing. While usauuly in a Nightwing vs Red Hood fight, I would back up Nightwing but this is a death tournament we are talking about. But in a in character fight, I would say Nightwing as he usually wins. In Batman: Battle for the Cowl Vol 1 3
And when Nightwing goes against Deathstroke, it doesn’t usually go that well for Dick. In New Titans Vol 1 86
Going down to Red Hood and Deathstroke, the winner will be Deathstroke. While Jason is able to “defeat” Slade in Deathstroke Vol 3 16, he was already injure before the fight and in the fight Deathstroke did put up a really great fight.
This is just my long and sort of bias opinion."

35eb81fe,"Why does my red blood cell, hematocrit, and hemoglobin counts remain very high putting me at risk for heart attacks and strokes? How can I reduce the numbers?","What is being described here is erythrocytosis. Before embarking on any work-up, I would review other laboratory chemistries with an eye toward determining if this result was artifactual as a result of dehydration. If so, the recommendation would be to drink more water, unless there are heart or kidney problems for which this recommendation would not apply.
Sometimes, what a patient believes is “very high” isn’t; without knowing what the entire CBC results are, this possible issue cannot be fully discerned.
What follows is a list of possible causes of erythrocytosis. This is a partial list as I am sure there may be something I am overlooking, but at least this is a beginning from which a possible answer may come.
I. Erythrocytosis associated with a normal or reduced red cell mass (spurious)
Acute or chronic hemoconcentration (relative)
Spurious polycythemia (also called stress polycythemia or Gaisböck’s syndrome)
II. Erythrocytosis associated with an elevated red cell mass (absolute polycythemia)
Polycythemia vera
Secondary polycythemia (increased erythropoietin production)
1. Systemic hypoxia
a. high altitude
b. cardiac disease with right-to-left shunt
c. chronic pulmonary disease
2. Decreased blood oxygen-carrying capacity, increase in carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin (smoking)
3. Impaired oxygen delivery, hemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity or congenital decreased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate
4. Local hypoxia — renal artery stenosis
5. Autonomous erythropoietin production
a. Tumors: hypernephroma, cerebellar hemangioblastoma, hepatoma, uterine fibroids, pheochromocytoma, adrenal cortical adenoma, ovarian carcinoma
b. Renal disorders: cysts, hydronephrosis, Bartter’s syndrome, postrenal transplantation, renal artery stenosis, focal sclerosing or membranous glomerulonephritis
6. Familial polycythemia due to autonomous erythropoietin production
Erythropoietin receptor mutations
VHL mutations (Chuvash polycythemia)
2,3-BPG mutation
PHD2 and HIF2α mutations
The use of anabolic steroids or recombinant erythropoietin; high oxygen affinity hemoglobins; sleep apnea syndrome; and hepatopulmonary syndrome are also possible.
If the diagnosis of polycythemia is established, it is an indolent disease with a median survival of over 15 years. The major cause of morbidity and mortality is arterial thrombosis. Over time, polycythemia vera may convert to myelofibrosis or to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In approximately 5% of cases, the disorder progresses to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which is usually refractory to therapy. It should, therefore, be apparent that anyone with a diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) should be referred to a hematologist.

A natural (preferably food-derived multi-Tocotrienol, type of Vitamin E. Especially one with a larger dose of gamma-tocotrienol - which will also give you some cancer protection as well. Not all vitamin E is the same. Most studies that diss vitamin E only use small doses of the weaker and synthetic, single-type. alpha-tocopherol. You want a high quality one or make sure you’re eating organic, foods rich in a spectrum of natural vitamin E types (eg: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta).
Taurine: Not a vitamin, but rather a conditionally deficient amino acid in some individuals and a powerful neuroprotective and proven
factor in preventing ischemic stroke. It’s actually used by veterinarians to prevent stroke and treat seizures in animals.
Magnesium - A key mineral most of us are missing and AKA Mother Nature’s muscle relaxer. In fact, Magnesium Taurate (see previous entry) is a popular supplement for those with migraine headaches.
NAC (N-acetyl cysteine)
, again, an amino-acid. A daily dose of NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) was found to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, including ischemic stroke and heart attack, by 40% compared to placebo in people with end-stage renal failure (a high-risk group).
Folate (but NOT folic-Acid - a common point of confusion). Specifically L-5-MTHF and 6S-5-MTHF﻿ (such as Quatrefolic [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid). Of course, food-sources of Folate are even better.
Fish Oil (Omega 3s)
Fish Oil Drug May Prevent Heart Attack and Strokes in High-Risk Patients
NOTE: There are some supplements that actually increase the incidence of stroke including calcium supplements. Food calcium is fine, but supplements can be a problem.

052e3fa5,What is the most effective swim stroke?,"Combining dolphin kick with breaststroke is the most easy stroke to keep up with good enough speed and very less wear and tear esp for older swimmers.
The key is to streamline and have a more wriggly forward action than a stroke as such. Once some speed is built up one can start the dolphin kick followed by breaststroke.
Retaining the forward momentum built up in the dolphin kick by jumping out of the water in an arc/ curve by arching the back immediately after the breaststroke acceleration, so as to retain the forward momentum as you re-enter the water in a curve.
This is the hydrodynamic way of reducing drag and reducing turbulence.

0570d178,"Why, of all possible damage, is hemiplegia such a common effect of stroke? (paralysis of one side of the body)","Hemiparesis[1] after a stroke[2] is most common (8 out of 10 stroke survivors can experience motor weakness). Hemiplegia is rarer.
Spasticity[3] (caused by Upper Motor Neuron damage by a lesion at any point in the Corticospinal; corticorubral; corticoreticular[4] and/or corticobulbar tracts) is a prime problem after a stroke. It can be severe enough that surgery is needed to prevent contractures. It’s a terrible two punch hit to recovery, as the limbs are weak but hypertonic (tight), too.
#1 site of Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) ischemic strokes (most common in the West) and hemorrhagic strokes is the Basal Ganglia[5] area. The Basal Ganglia due to it’s proximity to the pre-motor and motor corex, is why it influences the Corticolfugul systems[6], which affects movement of limbs.
Why a Posterior Limb of the Internal Capsule stroke can be mild yet devastating if a lesion affects that region, as that’s where the descending Corticospinal tract (and nearby ascending Spinalthalamic tract for sensation) passes from the cerebral cortex through the PLIC to the brain steam (where it crosses sides at the lower Medulla). A lesion there can cause cerebellar traits (without the truncal tribulations of a cerebellar stroke caused by Corticopontine projection fibers[7] being affected), and usually called Ataxic hemiparesis[8][9] (footnote #9 I added because so much data online concludes PLIC/ICpost strokes are caused by Middle Cerebral or Carotid arteries [including prestigious institutions as Stanford medical school], but the PLIC is a border zone between anterior and posterior circulations, and 4 arterial branches converge there — carotid artery (23.1%), middle cerebral artery (38.5%), PCA (17.3%), and the posterior communicating artery (21.1%)).

4ec0b053,What are the social effects of stroke?,"First of all, it makes you very lonely. After my second stroke, I could no longer work. I was a scientist at the National Geophysical Data Center; my life had basically been defined by science since high school. No longer …
I was stuck at home alone. My husband travelled a lot for his job; he said he needed to be away anyway. Apparently I was a handful!
Fortunately, I had my church, where I developed strong friendships. Even then, though, I usually only saw people on Sunday morning =(
To complicate matters, I quickly discovered that things have the potential to get extremely weird if you announce to people that you’ve had strokes. Nobody younger than about 60 even knows what a stroke IS. Of the people who do get it, the symptoms of stroke vary so widely that there’s no one set of deficits they can accurately predict you to have. “I apologize, but I’ve got to go home now. I’m very tired,” might be acceptable once, but you can’t use it a lot before arousing suspicion that you’re just a party pooper.
I can no longer drive. Do you know how difficult it is to get together with friends when you can’t get to them?
Eventually, my friends became the characters on TV shows I watched. I worked alongside Dr. Carter from ER and in the Office with Jim and Pam. It was a sad existence =(
The second effect the strokes had on me was to decrease my self esteem. In fact, this is the one thing that my therapists warned me about; sadly, their caution wasn’t misplaced. In addition to the loneliness I felt, I could also seemingly do nothing right.
“Goodness gracious, Kathy, you didn’t get the dog collars on right!?!? So you were shocking Chaco instead of Bonzo?” my husband accused me after Bonzo had bitten a neighbor. To top it off, I’d come inside to report Bonzo’s bad behavior and begun laughing hysterically, unaware that I suffered from psychobulbar affect (when you get your emotions mixed up and laugh and cry at odd times).
Speaking of PBA, it basically causes me to cry every time I hear loud music. Like at that college basketball game DH took me to and insisted that I not sit down until I stop sobbing. And like every Halloween parade my daughter has ever attended. It’s humiliating.
When I was finally up to start cooking again it was rather hit-or-miss. I remember baking a usually delicious triple chocolate fudge cake and forgetting the sugar, leading to a less than appealing concoction, and serving it to DH’s work friends. Oops.
There are times when I dive back into my level two to three tiredness and can’t do ANYTHING. That sucks, but what sucks more is the inability to define it as a stroke thing. Maybe I’m just lazy! =(
In short, having a stoke is like losing your old self. That fun-loving girl is gone now. =( I would’ve appreciated a funeral — a time when it would’ve been considered ok to lose my shit and cry and scream. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m cool with my new self, but there are times when I can sense my husband’s disappointment that ‘fun-loving girl’ is gone and it makes me sad for him."

cc609d23,"Why would I want the Covid vaccine if it has a clotting disorder as a side effect, and I’ve had multiple strokes? Aren’t strokes caused by clotting disorders?","Okay, here goes:
COVID-19 causes more than 20 times the number of blood clots of all types than any vaccines. So you reduce the chance of blood clots by taking the vaccine.
The numbers of blood clots seen for all except the Oxford vaccine is similar to the number of blood clots you see in the same number of unvaccinated people. So there is no risk ameliorated by not taking the vaccine.
The number of blood clots for the Oxford vaccine is problematic because a firm cause is suspected. But the numbers are still so small that they are under the aegis of the Law Of Small Numbers that basically says that when the number of observations is too small, no useful conclusions can be drawn.
The reasons that the Oxford and J&J vaccines were “paused” was not because of the blood clots per se, but because under Emergency Use Authorizations, the criteria are much, much, much more strict and the monitoring is much more intensive. It was just an overabundance of caution that was as much political as scientific. This is the system working like it is supposed to.
Birth control pills cause over 500 times as many blood clots per user. n.b. Childbirth is still 100 times as dangerous as taking birth control pills. This doesn’t stop the use of birth control pills, does it?
The number one cause of strokes is high blood pressure, not clots. This is followed by diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, tobacco, heart disease, poor diet, alcohol, lack of exercise, and stress, in that order. Notice that blood clots and vaccines ae not even in the top ten. However, COVID-19 can easily result in strokes and blood clots that will absolutely kill you quite dead.
Get the vaccine, especially if you are in poor health and have had strokes."
2aa2dd82,What effects do strokes have on people short term and long term?,"Strokes affect different people in different ways. The fact that your friend’s mom seems to be doing well now is a good sign, because people tend to get better as they recover from strokes. However, she may be at risk of future strokes. I have seen strokes have the following affects on people:
No effect
Semi-paralysis
Full paralysis
Speech impairment
Brain damage
Fine motor skills impairment
Sometimes strokes will affect one side of a body. A person can experience full or partial paralysis of his or her entire right side. You may notice one side of the face droops; that is because half of the face is paralyzed. If someone has facial paralysis, they may need eye drops to help moisten the eye that doesn't blink naturally.
Sometimes a stroke can cause severe brain damage. The person may lose all ability to speak. It may affect other areas of cognitive functioning, too. Some people go through intensive rehabilitation to relearn how to walk, write, read, and talk.
I have had clients who did not even know they had high blood pressure. They only learned about it when they suffered a major stroke. One woman in particular is paralyzed on one side, wheel chair bound, and lost the ability to read. Now She is able to communicate and sign her name, and she can walk with a leg brace and someone near by in case she falls. It has been about 9 years since her stroke. Some people recover more quickly than that.
I really hope your friend’s mom will be ok Everything I stated above is a frightening prospect, but like I said earlier, if she is doing good now, her abilities are not likely to regress."
175680b3,Is clopidogrel or ticlopidine (ticlid) as effective as aspirin in preventing stroke?,"Clopidogrel is an anti-clotting drug: it prevents platelets from congregating at the site of a broken blood vessel and plugging up the tear.
I believe that clopidogrel is better than aspirin at preventing ISCHEMIC stroke because my neurologist told me that she wasn’t surprised that I’d had another on just aspirin. She also told me that she thought clopidogrel would, in my case, prevent further strokes better than warfarin! I was very glad to hear that; warfarin is an extremely strong drug, requires that you eat a constant amount of leafy green vegetables, and requires that you get frequent testing to make sure your levels are ok.
But please be sure that we’re talking about the same kind of stroke. All of these drugs are anti-clotting/anti-coagulant-types, and will help to prevent an ischemic stroke BUT are not useful in preventing hemmoragic stroke; they actually increase your risk of such a stroke. That said, I know of somebody who had an hemmoragic stroke and was put on warfarin afterwards to prevent another stroke. In short, it’s really complicated! I’d trust your doctor.
TL;DR Probably."
ecbcbe1c,"What is a stroke, and what are the effects of stroke? What effects can be seen with a stroke in the brain stem?","As the blood pressure drops down, the blood supply towards the brain decreases and it does not get enough oxygen and nutrients. This creates a state of hypoxia. Very less blood flow toward the brain can lead to ischemic shock which releases inflammatory mediators that cause Hypotension Headache. The pain usually increases upon bending forward or lying down.
Low Blood pressure can be due to excessive electrolyte loss by vomiting and diarrhea especially in summers when the body is already on the verge of dehydration.
Excessive bleeding can also lead to hypovolemia and thus hypotension and ischemic stroke to the brain.
Some inflammatory conditions such as pancreatitis can also cause Hypotension as fluid enters the inflamed tissue around the pancreas and in the abdominal cavity, escaping from the blood vessels resulting in concentrated blood and Hypovolemia.
Bradycardia that is slow heart rate can also decrease the amount of blood pumped by the heart resulting in low blood pressure, lightheadedness, and sometimes even syncope (fainting).
Some medications can also cause Hypotension, such as: Calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, Antidiuretics, ACE inhibitors, and Alpha Blockers"
27eef567,How can we increase the power of an engine without changing the bore and stroke of the engine cylinder?,"Increasing the power of an engine can help increase the performance of your car to a certain extent.
You increase the power output by any of the following methods:
I) Installing a bigger air filter: a bigger and more efficient air filter will help your engine breath better.
This will improve combustion and thus increase the power output. This is one of the cheapest options available in the market. This also implies that the end power output won't be very noticeable. It doesn't require many changes to other parts of the car and doesn't increase the load or pressure on the engine.
II) ECU remapping: the brain of the engine can be remapped in order to increase the power output. It alters the way the engine responds and thus increase the power it produces.
This method too doesn't cost much and doesn't require many changes to other parts of the car. Again the net power output is limited.
III) Installing a turbocharger: a turbocharger is much like an air filter only it pumps sufficiently more amount of air in to engine and thus increases power output.
If you are looking for a power bump in
a diesel car it's more likely that you already have a turbocharger installed. It isnt cheap and many a times it is necessary to upgrade accompanying parts of the engine. This is because more power means more pressure or load on the engine which needs to taken care of by cooling the engine efficiently and adjusting it's computers and mechanicals. A good turbo can boost your engines power output by 50bhp!
To contain the increase in power necessary improvement in mechanicals are recommended. Better brake pads are recommended. So are gaskets and filters. Oils and coolants of higher effectiveness (i.e aimed at high performance vehicles) are recommended. ECU remapping can further boost performance. Recalibration or gauges and meters may also be required.
Increasing the power of an old vehicle can lend a new lease of life to the vehicle and if done carefully can make a new car even more spirited. All the best for your mod. :)"
b290eba9,What is Ram effect in Petrol engine during compression stroke?,"Generally inlet valve is closed at few degrees after piston reaches bdc ie. During initial part of compression, inlet valve remains open for few degrees. It ensures that momentum of incoming air is not hampered. This momentum provides inertia to incoming air to move forward even though compression has started. This phenomenon of pushing air into the cylinder with the help of its momentum is called ram effect.
Thus ram effect pushes more air into the cylinder to increase volumetric efficiency."
33fa60d7,What are the long and short term effects of a stroke? What varying symptoms occur before and after a stroke survivor?,"I’m a stroke survivor. I know exactly how lucky I have been, but I still hate it.
I had a right-side ischemic (clot) stroke with damage to the right posterior basal ganglia. The damage is small- only 1.2 cm across. The effects, though, are big.
I did not lose consciousness nor have my cognitive abilities been damaged according to the Speech Language Pathologist. I could bear weight and had a reciprocal gait the next day. However—
I had no idea where my left hand was- none. Once it was bent up behind me, and the nurse had to reposition because I was nearly laying on it, and didn’t know it wasn’t resting comfortably in front of me. If I held a cup of water in that hand and wasn’t looking at it every second, I would spill it- not from lack of strength, but because I didn’t know where it was and what position it was in, so the cup would tilt and spill. This is called proprioception- and I lost left side proprioception in a really weird way.
The loss in the upper limb- the hand- is pretty classic; the loss in the lower limb, hip to toes, was weird. Unlike not knowing where my foot was without looking, I lost bits and pieces of proprioception. For instance, I had my toes, but not my ankle. I could feel weight on my knee, but not my calf. My hip was all buggered up by it, with some muscles of the joint being known and others just along for the ride. In Therapy, they worked on strength so I could at least walk without a walker, but it took time to get all my bits and pieces back so I could do it correctly. I have stumped around like Igor for the past four months, but this past week, I seem to be getting back the last piece in my hip which is effecting the psoas muscle. Hooray for me!
But, I still hate it.
I am no longer graceful- I was so graceful and competent. I moved swiftly and unerringly; I could walk two miles in 15 minutes; I could reach and bend and crouch and stretch and climb and move.
Now I have to think about every move I make. I have to think when I walk- consciously think about each bit of the stride, chiding myself when my heel doesn’t strike the floor in the correct cadence, when I don’t push off with my toes hard enough, screwing up the gait. It is so tiring. It is so disheartening to have to do this, to have to be so super-aware of what used to be done naturally, with no thought, at all.
I await the day I suddenly realize I haven’t had to think about all of this- I hope it comes soon.
But, I am lucky- very, very lucky. I could have lost the ability to swallow correctly, thus being on a feeding tube (worst case) or pureed mush diet for, well, ever. I could have lost the ability to speak, the larnyx frozen. I could have lost cognitive ability- as is, for the first couple months, it was as if the toy box where I held my stuff had been given a big shake; I knew I had whatever bit I needed, but had to sort through to find it again. But I could have lost all of it, I could have lost my life, so I am lucky.
And all my therapists seem so surprised to learn I am only 4 months out from this stroke; “You’re already back at work?” “You don’t have to push so hard, you know”; yes, I do, because I know the earlier I get back, the more I get back, so it’s off to the races as far as I am concerned.
There was no precursor to my stroke. In fact, the whole episode took about 10 minutes- How do you stop a stroke while it’s happening? I’ve read some people feel dizzy sometimes, but there’s usually no sign it’s coming.
Which is why they can be so deadly.
If you are at risk for stroke, follow your doctor’s instructions- if you can get away from having this happen to you, you’ll be glad."

fe18f8aa,What is best style in swimming?,"Most strokes have some advantage to them. They are each best in one circumstance or another.
For swimming fast or long, front crawl, sometimes known as freestyle is best. There is nothing more efficient. It is the high speed, fuel efficient motorcycle of strokes.
Breaststroke is the Mac truck of strokes. Not that fast but hugely powerful.
Story time: At university, our coach devised a competition where two swimmers would be connected to surgical tubing. This tubing was strong and very elastic. Even with its elasticity, two swimmers going opposite directions could not both make it to their end of the pool. The coach gave no rules so I kept my breaststroke option secret. I outswam my first opponent simply with freestyle and then faced two more opponents and was furious. I migh have been able to beat the first one using freestyle but it was a close thing. I was faster but he was stronger. So I stuck to freestyle for around a minute then switched and pulled him down the pool. He later said he knew exactly when I switched strokes and he felt as if Ihad pulled on the side. The final swimmer was much better than I but not at breaststroke so I beat him to but it was more work than I wanted.
Okay, breaststroke is good for towing things or getting your head high in waves.
Backstroke gives you a different view and I have used it to navigate. I swam away from one or two objects on shore and could watch them best while doing backstroke.
I have heard that Navy Seals use a form of side stroke for very long swims. I have gone 12 km using frontcrawl but that was in smooth water so maybe sidestroke is better in surf or waves.
I can’t think of a practical reason to do butterfly. It looks really cool and gives you big shoulders (if the training doesn’t cause shoulder injury!) so it may be good for showing off. To be honest, since I don’t compete anymore, that is the only reason I do butterfly now.
What do you want to do? The answer will determine what the best stroke is."

How do I deal with this?","As I'm getting older also, and have had several friends and relatives die within the past two years, I have also begun to have occasional fearful thoughts about my mortality and the disabilities I might one day face.
At my last doctor's visit I spoke about this with her. She's a few years younger than I but she told me it's normal, to an extent, to have thoughts such as this as we age. She said she tells herself she's here, now, this day, and that's all that's guaranteed anyone. Even a young person could have an accident or suddenly become gravely ill. She said she simply pushes thoughts of such from her mind, works and finds distractions and doesn't dwell on it. I've been trying to do the same with a fair degree of success.
This is probably just a temporary rumination, you will probably pass through this phase. Of course everyone on the planet is mortal but why ruin today thinking about the future? It's helpful if you could share your thoughts with close friends or family. My sisters and I recently spoke on the subject in a light-hearted tone. We all agreed we wouldn't want to live forever, even if we could. We even managed to have a few laughs about the potential upcoming infirmaries.

92ae4ede,Are there any reverse effects for someone who had a stroke?,"No, brain cells that die as a result of a CVA (stroke) do not regenerate. Any brain imaging I have will always show the damage done by my hemorrhagic stroke.
That said, initially, I could not move my left side or feel anything on the left. I can now walk, type with 10 fingers and I function pretty well. It took time and lots of effort, but that was a good investment. The effects were not “reversed”, but my brain “rewired” around the damaged parts reasonably well."
71d595a6,How do Strokes occur and how do they effect the human brain and body?,"The term “stroke” when referring to the brain describes two very different scenarios: the most common (maybe 90%) of strokes are caused by an embolism, a blood clot in an artery feeding the brain which slows or entirely stops blood flow in that artery, killing the brain structure dependent on that blood flow. The other kind of “stroke”, much less common (about 10%) is called an aneurysm (which can occur anywhere in the body) or a brain bleed. There are two kinds of aneurysms: the blood vessel has a weakness in the wall that causes it to balloon outward until it breaks, flooding the brain with blood, and a collapse inward that causes a tear in the blood vessel, same result, blood flooding the interstitial spaces of the brain and insufficient blood flow to the brain structure through normal delivery channels, so that brain structure suffers cell death.
Because an embolism induced brain stroke and a brain aneurysm stroke can have the same symptoms (at first), it is a risk to inject the chemical that dissolves blood clots because it can make a brain bleed even worse.
A stroke can be so mild you don’t even notice it, until they keep occurring and finally symptoms appear. Depending on where it occurs, there are a great variety of symptoms, you can look them up."
e9f8c7d0,Is stem cell treatment such as Swiss medica effective in stroke rehab?,"As far as I know this is a new field of research. Some clinical trials have shown that the treatment is safe and effective:

patients
Of course, this will vary based on the patient, cause of stroke, and stem cell treatment used. As treatments improve a wider variety of treatment options will be available for a wider range of patients.
If you are interested in knowing if a SPECIFIC type of stem cell treatment is effective I’d suggest looking for clinical trials conducted regarding that treatment, and look at the patients treated in the study. A treatment option may only work for a narrow range of patients.
Swiss Medica claims to have some clinically relevant information here:

b7cc7b8b,What effects are there when a stroke happens on the right side of the brain?,"I’ve had both a LHS CVA and a RHS CVA.
First of all, let me preface this by saying that every stroke is unique. I had an argument with a doctor who told me that “You couldn’t possibly have had right-sided facial paralysis! That was a left-brained stroke!” He was a jerk. I DID have right-sided facial paralysis along with left-sided weakness; my stroke was near the center of my brain, which is probably why my symptoms were abnormal.
The biggest difference, I found, was that I developed depression after my RHS CVA. We don’t know *why* I became depressed — whether it’s because of the location of the infarct or just because I’d been completely and utterly useless for the last six months and I really didn’t fancy living the rest of my life like that — but it’s something to note. Strokes on the right side of your brain can often propel you into depression, and it’s miserable.
Other than that, i don’t know of any symptoms that can’t develop from a stroke on either side of the brain. Lucky you! ;)"
93808fec,What are the most effective treatments available for stroke patients?,"For ischemic strokes (80% of all strokes) within the thrombrctomy window (up to 4.5 hrs after last seen normal), and without any contraindications, the gold standard treatment is IV thrombolysis. For patients meeting certain criteria (i.e. large proximal vessel occlusion, small infarct core, etc…), endovascular thrombectomy can also be considered. If the patient presents outside the window or is ineligible for thrombolysis, he or she is admitted for strict blood pressure and intracranial pressure control.
For hemorrhagic strokes (20% of all strokes), the immediate goal is blood pressure and intracranial pressure control, with a combination of medications, hypertonic saline, and/or external ventricular drain placement. After further work up with CT, MRI, and/or angiography a definitive treatment plan is made often with surgical intervention (i.e. clip or coil an aneurysm, resection of AVM, etc…). If no vascular malformation is identified, for example, in cases of trauma or hypertensive intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the patient is medically managed for strict blood pressure and intracranial pressure control.
This is of course a general overview and specific management is individualized for each patient. There’s a large number of trials looking at timing of invervention and whether additional treatments (i.e. tpa plus endovascular thrombectomy vs endovascular alone, coil vs clipping, ICP monitoring, etc…) affect outcomes."
7c4bf5a1,What are long-term effects of stroke?,
4a7170db,"Which has the greater effect on cardiac output, stroke volume or heart rate?","Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. An increase in both can increase the cardiac output.
During exercise it is seen that in the initial stages there is increased venous return from the muscles, this brings about in increase in stroke volume which can increase by about 2 - 3 times from the normal. Subsequently the increase in cardiac output can be brought about by the increase in heart rate alone.
Which of these predominate to increase cardiac output will depend on what stage of exercise the individual is at. Both stroke volume and heart rate will increase when a person starts to exercise. At approximately 40% of the maximum possible exercise intensity possible the increase in stroke volume stops or slows down and then on the increase in heart rate keeps the increase in cardiac output."

9d65ee06,What will be the long-term effects of a person who survived a hemorrhagic stroke?,"Like with all strokes it depends on the location of the stroke and anatomical differences (where the arteries [or veins] are located, as there’s anatomical differences that 5mm away can be a difference between a minor or a catastrophic stroke).
This is what stroke survivors mean about location and/or anatomical differences.
I’ll use the Posterior Limb of the Internal Capsule (ICpos) for an example, as that’s what I study.
See the blue area? It can actually be influenced by *3* arteries: lenticulostriate branches of the MCA; anterior choroidal artery; AND the deep branches of the Posterior Cerebral Artery.
My stroke was a PCA stroke. It hit in between the Genu and the Corticospinal tract areas, nearer to the Thalamus. So that anatomy difference is how one stroke hit 5 areas of the brain …. but luckily it was mild due to the location (skipping especially a direct hit on the Corticospinal tract (A/T/L area), which would’ve paralyzed my arm, hand and leg).
The Corticospinal tract is a major motor pathway in the brain, and it tunnels through the ICpos white matter, where one small lesion can take out the arm and leg movement in one strike permanently.
Now you can understand WHY location is critical in the outcomes.
^^ That shows how an ICpos stroke can affect not only the Corticospinal tract and vision, it can affect hearing, too. Why I have, ironically, LEFT sided hearing problems though I had a Right Hemisphere (RH) stroke. Actual location of the lesion is in the RH ICpos, but everything from the left eyelid to left toe was effected. Including the throat, especially with swallowing and talking (hoarseness), too.
The drawing below explains HOW a RH stroke shows the opposite side (contralateral) affects , even if it doesn’t cross at the Medulla. Evolution caused the body to protect the RH, since cognition and executive functions (decision making) are located there. RH strokes are more rare.
As for a hemorrhagic stroke outcomes compared to a ischemic stroke? Hemorrhagic strokes are more devastating. Person will have a bad migraine headache and will attempt to lay down for relief. IF they survive to wake up again; or luck up when someone notices something isn’t right, by the time they get to the hospital it’s too late (bleed to death if it’s a large enough aneurysm; or 12hrs later with a slow leak the inflammation wrecks havoc on the brain tissue itself). Actual blood contact to the brain is highly toxic and causes a nasty inflammation that leads to worse outcomes.
BUT, it depends on location of the hemorrhage; the size; and did the person get to the hospital fast enough to get help. PLUS, the will of the person to struggle through the obstacles in physical therapy. Doesn’t matter if it’s a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, got to press forward despite the odds. If the docs say chances are you won’t walk again, fight on. That’’s what my grandpa did after a devastating MCA stroke that paralyzed his arm and leg, and the docs said he will be wheelchair bound. But he showed them he could walk with a cane and braces again.
Each stroke survivor’s journey to recovery is personal."
386ee919,"What is the effect on an engine when you ""stroke"" it versus when you ""bore"" it?","Q: What is the effect on an engine when you ""stroke"" it versus when you ""bore"" it?
Increasing the stroke with a different crankshaft will net a far larger increase in displacement than boring out the cylinders. There is a limit to how far the bore can be increased before encountering issues with cylinder wall integrity, ring seal, and overheating. Generally, a longer stroke will provide more torque than before, and make the torque peak occur earlier in the engine's rev range than an engine of similar displacement with a larger bore and shorter stroke. In a high performance application, the increased displacement from stroking should be matched by a bigger carb or injectors, more cam, and porting the heads to meet the demand for air and fuel."

ab48f6ef,What are the alternatives to anti-epileptic drugs like Levipil (Generic name: Levetiracetam) given to patients post a hemorrhagic stroke? Potentially with better results and fewer side effects.,"As per the NICE guidelines, it is recommended that the lowest, most effective dose of an anti-epileptic proven to have the highest efficacy for the patient’s seizure-type and epilepsy should be chosen; if mono therapy with one agent is deemed ineffective, or produces intolerable side-effects, then mono therapy with a second agent may be tried, after overlapping and tapering the dose of the first one as per established guidelines; this can be continued with the second or third anti-epileptic, till all choices have been exhausted, at which point polypharmacy or combination drugs may be considered.
This is to highlight how far away Neurologist’s and epileptilogists want to move away from the erstwhile practise of using suboptimal doses of several drugs - something I still find happening occasionally.
The picture below is a screenshot from NICE
page of the said guidelines:
In practise, I have found Levetiracetam to be relatively free of side - effects - except for agitation and restless in elderly/demented patients, and some patients have complained of worsened tremors. The concern is of efficacy - and the general feeling is that if a drug is not producing much side-effect, then it’s not producing that much effect either! Which might be the reason why Granny’s nostrums almost always made you feel you were going to choke and die!
I haven’t had an issue with lack of efficacy as far as levetiracetam is concerned, but I am a consensus of one man! Let the others submit their reports!
But if you did want to replace it, and myoclonus jerks or absence seizures (petit mal) are not included in the patient’s repertoire, then oxcarbazepine would be my choice. A lot of people prefer lamotrigine, but the high incidence of skin lesions (unless dose escalation is done very carefully) makes it somewhat difficult. It has shown good improvement in scholastic performance, which is an added advantage in school-going children with borderline IQs. It is also a broad-spectrum antiepileptic, so it can be given in someone who has more than one seizure type (grand mal + myoclonus, etc). It may also be a better choice in women, as the alternative (Depakine/Valproate) is a drug you would wish to avoid in them.
My experience with other alternatives is not enough to give any advise."

I spent the first year learning how to walk again and building strength in my legs. Once I had that mastered, I turned my attention to improving my gait which wasn’t pretty. My affected left leg would swing in a semi circle around my body to complete a step, with my hip hiking up mid step to propel me forward. Treadmill walking allows me to control my gait pace and cadence while walking at a specific, consistent pace. I like 0.8 or 1.0km /per hour as a casual walking pace. I try to keep a good posture. Shoulders back eyes straight ahead while strolling on my treadmill for 15 to 30 minutes a day. I find it is really helping to smooth my walking gait. I am hopeful to walk without the use of an aid this year such as a cane or in my case a hiking pole for balance. My advice to anyone in this situation.

Artificially Sweetened Drinks Linked to
Stroke
After adjusting for known stroke
risk factors
, such as obesity, age, and high blood pressure, the researchers found that women who drank 24 ounces or more of diet beverages per day were 23 percent more likely to have a stroke than those who drank less than 12 ounces per week. They were also 29 percent more likely to develop heart disease
and 16 percent more likely to die from any cause.
Other studies have shown a connection between diet drinks and
stroke
. For example, in April 2017, researchers at Boston University School of Medicine found that people age 45 and older who drank one or more diet sodas every day were three times more likely to have a stroke than those who didn’t drink them.
But this new study is one of the first to zero in on the link between diet beverages and specific subtypes of strokes. The researchers found that big consumers of diet drinks had an 81 percent greater risk of small artery occlusion, a stroke that’s caused by a blockage of small vessels in the brain, than women who consumed less than one per day. “These strokes are not generally as devastating as those caused by a large vessel blockage,” says Mossavar-Rahmani. “But if you have them repeatedly, they can lead to dementia.
Greater Risk for Some Women
The study found that heavy consumption of diet drinks put certain women at far greater risk. Those who were obese
(defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher) were about twice as likely to have an ischemic stroke as obese women who rarely or never drank them.
For African-American women, those who drank the most diet beverages were about four times more likely to have an ischemic stroke. “We know that in general stroke rates are higher in African-Americans and in those who are obese,” says Mossavar-Rahmani. “But our data can’t explain why higher diet drink consumption increased risk so significantly for these groups and not for others.”
And big consumers of diet drinks who did not have a history of heart disease or diabetes were 2½ times more likely to have small artery occlusion compared with such women who rarely or ever drink them.
What the Study Can't Tell Us
The study authors caution that their findings don't actually say that diet drinks cause stroke.
“Observational studies like this one attempt to associate behaviors with outcomes but cannot prove cause and effect,” says Robert Rankin, president of the Calorie Control Council, a group that represents the low-calorie and reduced-calorie food and beverage industry. “It is likely study subjects were already at greater health risk and chose these beverages to manage their calorie and sugar intake.”
And though this very large group was tracked for almost 12 years, the information on diet-drink consumption came from a questionnaire given three years into the study asking how often the women drank artificially sweetened drinks in the previous three months. “The results are derived from a snapshot in time,” says Hannah Gardener, Sc.D., associate scientist in the department of neurology at the University of Miami, who co-authored an editorial accompanying the study. “For some people, that may not reflect their long-term consumption pattern.”
It's also not known whether the women who drank large quantities of diet beverages had spent their previous years drinking sugar-sweetened sodas
. “It’s possible that they were already on the road to heart disease when they switched to the artificially sweetened beverages,” says Ralph L. Sacco, M.D., professor of neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. And because this study looked only at postmenopausal women, the results don’t necessarily apply to younger women or men.
What You Should Do
Despite many studies showing associations between diet soda intake and adverse health effects, researchers caution that they still don’t know exactly why diet sodas might be bad for you. It’s possible that ingredients in the beverages—including the artificial sweeteners—could damage blood vessels, affect metabolic function, or cause inflammation.
The best advice, given what we know so far, is to err on the side of caution. “This study adds to the growing consistency of research showing an association between diet soda consumption and heart disease risk,” says Sacco. “And since research has not shown that switching to artificially sweetened beverages is that helpful for weight loss
, there’s very little reason to recommend drinking them.”
“We have enough data now to recommend people be cautious about diet soda consumption,” says Gardener. “The research shows that they are not harmless and that they may actually increase your risk of cardiovascular events
, such as stroke.” She advises that water is the best beverage, and says if people use diet drinks to help wean themselves off sugar-sweetened ones, they should do so for a limited period of time as they transition to water
and other healthier beverages.
Correction: A previously published version of this story said that the researchers found that big consumers of diet drinks had an 18 percent greater risk of small artery occlusion stroke. The correct increase in risk is 81 percent. In addition, the Boston University Study was conducted April 2017, not April 2018.
A recent study found that drinking even one diet soda a day may triple your risk for developing dementia. But there's a lot more to the story. Nutrition Diva explains

In a large observational study, women who reported drinking more than one diet soda or other artificially sweetened drinks a day had a higher risk of strokes caused by a blood clot. The association between diet drinks and stroke risk was stronger in obese women and in African-American women. Feb 14, 2019

“Most strokes affect one side of the brain. If the right occipital lobe is injured, the left field of vision in each eye may be affected. A stroke that affects the left occipital lobe may disturb the right field of vision in each eye. Rarely, both sides of the brain are affected, but this can result in blindness.”(2)
“When a stroke occurs in the primary visual cortex, the neurons responsible for processing vision can be damaged. Depending upon the extent of the damage, this can result in blind areas in the field of vision. While some patients spontaneously recover vision over time, the loss is permanent for most.”(3)

Apply onion juice at the back of ears, under shoulders and on your chest. Slices onions can also be eaten raw or roasted, as per preference.
Boil tamarind with water. Once the prepared juice has cooled down, drink it with a pinch of black salt for immediate relief.
Prepare Aam-Panna. the refreshing juice not just cools down body temperature but also saves from future strokes.
Drink buttermilk. It has lots of health benefits which help in treating heat strokes.
Coconut water can be another better alternative. Not just for hear strokes, but it can be taken for regular temperature regulation too.
Drink aloe vera juice. You can either buy or prepare it at home.

d0f2fa7a,"If you move or shake slightly in an MRI, could damage that it not really there been shown? E.g., could you end up with a false diagnosis of a small stroke or something to that effect?","Once when I had a brain MRI, it took a long time and I went to sleep for a few minutes. The tech had to re-do part of the test since I moved my head just slightly and he saw it on the machine. If you’re looking for a kind of “false positive” due to movement, I would doubt that. Get your doctor to show you the MRI image which should be online in the office. A question like this should be really discussed with the doctor. In my experience, places where a TIA or whatever has occurred in the brain are readily visible. The the tech watches the progress of the test for aberrations like that too.

There are, however, a few other reasons why you might stop it, stroke history or not:
2- If the patient has a terminal illness and a limited prognosis, then it’s not uncommon to cease any and all medications except those with symptomatic benefit. For instance, someone who is dying of advanced cancer and has days to weeks will probably not benefit from long-term cholesterol-lowering therapy!

90d8aed1,What is a “lacunar stroke”? What effects can one have?,"A lacunar stroke occurs when one of the arteries that provide blood to the brain's deep structures is blocked.Unlike most arteries, which gradually taper to a smaller size, the small arteries of a lacunar stroke branch directly off of a large, high-pressure, heavily muscled main artery. Many of the deep brain organs that can be injured by a lacunar stroke help to relay communication between the brainstem and the brain cortex, or help to coordinate complicated body movements. In a lacunar stroke, brain cells in a relatively small area (measuring from 3 millimeters to as much as 2 centimeters across) are damaged or killed by lack of oxygen. Such a small area of brain destruction is called a lacune. A lacunar stroke involves only a small area of the brain, but it can cause significant disability.
People often begin to recover within hours or days of a lacunar stroke. Lacunar strokes have a better rate of recovery than other strokes that involve larger blood vessels. More than 90 percent of people with a lacunar stroke will recover substantially within the first three months following the stroke."

c5d1b4f5,Do you think that a person with a family history of heart attack and stroke will reduce their risk by donating platelets through apheresis? There has been no personal cardiac event. Would taking Plavix be worth the potential side effects.,"Probably No and No - but read on. There a number of well recognised risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g. heart attack and ischaemic stroke), but a risk factor is a little different from a treatment target. The recommended preventative treatments are those based on prospective clinical studies showing that the treatment (lifestyle or medical) achieves the desired outcome - as measured by a reduced risk of a clinical measurement (reduction in death/stroke/heart attack), not by a change in a de facto risk marker (e.g. BP, blood sugar or cholesterol level). So the things that reduce risk are healthy diet (yes, moderate alcohol intake is OK), regular exercise, avoiding smoking, treating high BP … and if you are at high risk, statin medication and aspirin. Of relevance statins have been thought of as cholesterol lowering drugs and therefore that any benefit is related to this effect. naturally many people assume that and cholesterol lowering will be beneficial, and therefore the modest effect of platelet apheresis ‘might’ have a small benefit. It turns out however that statins have lots of effect unrelated to the change in blood cholesterol levels that are probably important for their long term benefit, and other ways of cholesterol lowering probably don’t have these benefits. So great that you’re a platelet donor, but any CV risk reduction is likely to be minimal. Best to address the other treatable risk factors. With regard to Plavix/clopidogrel, we know that if you have a moderate-high CV risk, then low dose aspirin has a small benefit. It also has a small bleeding risk, so you need to have a high enough CV risk for the total benefit to outweigh the bleeding concern. And aspirin has been shown to have other benefits, such as reducing the likelihood of dying form bowel cancer (probably because the dangerous polyps are detected and treated at an earlier stage). So obviously people might assume theat the same benefit would exist for clopidogrel. And maybe it does, but we can’t be sure without a specific study. So my suggestion is to look at your overall risk profile - there are plenty of on line calculators (e.g. Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score
). Then maybe ‘add a bit’ for your family history - this is not usually included in these calculators, as too hard to quantify (e.g. t depends so much on the age and the number of your first degree relatives that have had CV events, whether they were smokers, and whether any strokes were ischaemia or bleeds…just to name a few issues). Lifestyle factors are always worth treating, and depending on your personal risk profile/calculation think about a statin and/or aspirin. If you can’t tolerate aspirin (very cheap), but are high risk, then maybe the cost of clopidogrel could be justified (I’m doubtful). I hope this helps you think about things."

Is the guy stalking and/or harassing you? Do you want him out of your life but he just won’t go? After 18 years of this, a restraining order is probably a good option.
Are you still friends with him? Is he pleasant to talk to, chat with, e-mail or text with? If so, then why is there a problem? Or are you asking whether it should be a problem?
Would you like to get back together with him? That’s a whole different situation.

The flash point of a 2 cycle engine oil is totally immaterial! The oil is mixed with petrol (Gasoline) and the resulting mixture will have a very low flash point. Self mixing 2 cycle oil is diluted with white spirit and normally has a flash point of about 40 °C. Non self mixing oils have flash point nearer to 200 °C. For safety reasons, a higher flash point is preferred. BTW there are several methods to determine the flash point and all provide different results."

30f43768,What are the solutions on water pollution?,"A very important question, with so many aspects.
First there are ditches, canals, rivers, lakes and the sea. Then are many kinds of pollution, and they can behave different. And allso there are several ways pollution ends up in the water.
Let’s break this down. The pollution (I assume you’re talking about) comes from humans. The main sources are houses, industrial activities, transport and mining. The polution can be mineral, chemical or biologal. Humans have a habit of cleaning everything with water. In times there were no detergents and complex chemicals and there were not so many people, that was not a big deal.
Nowadays most pollution can be prevented by using less toxic substances and waste water treatment. The treatment has to be able to take out or neutralize de pollution. Biological waste (like faeces) in small amounts is no big problem, but in large amounts the rotting proces can take all the oxygen out of the water and kill all life. In the oceans this will allmost never happen, because it becomes diluted. But treatment costs money, and in many countrys this will take a huge amount of effort.
In countries that allready have waste water treatment there are often still many things to improve. E.g. in many countries waste-water of big areas is treated in large plants, but water from roofs is on the same sewerage-system. That can cause the treatment-plant to be flushed when there is heavy rainfall.
To top this all off strict legislation is needed. Important is the ban on non-biodegradable plastics, and preventing ships dumping bilge-oil and other waste in the sea.
A difficult problem is toxicm (mineral) waste-water from mining. This is hard to take out of the water and (often) governments that share in the profit don’t give a damn."

c03dd7d2,How does a stroke effect the optical nerve?,"Pretty much how any stroke (ischemic infarct of the nervous system) affects nerves in the brain, spinal cord, or even peripheral nerves. The nerves die. Because the blood supply was cut off. By the occlusion of the arteries that supply oxygenated blood to that nerve or nerves.
In the case of the “optic nerve” that would be mostly the posterior ciliary arteries, a set of small arteries that supply blood to the optic nerve as its fibers leave the back of the eye on their way to the brain.
Sometimes only half of the arteries are blocked, more commonly the upper half, and that creates a partial stroke of the optic nerve. If this occurs, the patient loses half of the vision in only one optic nerve (in the case I described, it would be the lower half) and that is called an “altitudinal defect”. It looks as though someone drew a straight horizontal line across the patient's vision in that eye, and blacked out the entire lower half (can happen with the upper half also)."
