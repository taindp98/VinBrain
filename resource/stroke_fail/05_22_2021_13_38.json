{"_id": "ce34399b", "question": "What is an ischemic stroke?", "answers": "Blood carries oxygen through our bodies and we need oxygen to live. Any part of the body that doesn’t receive oxygen gets injured and begins to die. This is called ischemia.\nAn ischemic stroke is a type of stroke that happens when there is a blockage that builds up in the blood vessels of the brain preventing blood or oxygen from flowing.\nA blockage in blood vessels usually happens when it “clogs”.\nThe blood vessels to the brain are like pipes they carry water. Layers of mold and “gunk” can buildup over many years. The same kind of build-up can happen in a person’s arteries.\nArteries are the blood vessels that carry blood FROM the heart TO the brain.\nSimilar to the mold or “gunk” that clogs the pipes, there is far the clogs the arteries.\nThis is called atherosclerosis.\nSometimes the blockage builds up in the blood vessels of the chest or neck, which then breaks loose and travels up to the brain. This is called an embolus.

{"_id": "f0becf61", "question": "What is the best neuroimaging modality for acute ischemic stroke?", "answers": "One of the most useful ways to image acute stroke is a combination of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) with perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI). Diffusion weighting is about actually imaging how \"free\" water molecules are in a certain region of tissue (and it depends on how much water there is as well). You can think of it as looking at tissue microstructure by evaluating how tissue water is behaving. When tissue dies and you have an ischemic infarct, diffusion goes way down. However, there are still areas surrounding the infarcted region that are viable but aren't getting sufficient blood perfusion. perfusion weighting helps show those regions, as it actually looks at how much fresh blood supply is entering into a region. Quickly re-perfusing those regions that are still viable but are inadequately perfused is critical to saving that tissue and preventing the lesion of infarcted tissue from growing, which increases chances for functional recovery. It's a very short time window to really help the stroke patient in this way at this acute phase ...\nSee: http://radiology-medical-imaging-technology.blogspot.com/2012/12/perfusion-imaging-of-infarct-and.html\nHere's a brief comparison between information you glean from DWI and information you glean from PWI in ischemic stroke:\n\n(from Part II: Modalities, input, and image processing see\nstroke\ndifferently\n)"}
{"_id": "032ca7a8", "question": "What is the best treatment for an ischemic stroke?", "answers": "Well, there are two timeframes for treatment: the acute phase (while you’re in the hospital) and afterwards.\nThe immediate treatment is TPA, if you’re eligible for it; that breaks up the clot. If you haven’t gotten to the hospital in time for TPA, the next best thing is heparin. Heparin prevent your blood from clotting and helps prevent any further clots from forming.\nOnce you’re out of the hospital, you’ll probably want to see a physiatrist (“rehab doctor”). She will ask you:\n*How’s your sleep? If it’s not good, she will probably prescribe one of several sleeping pills. N.B. That these did not help me; Ambien gave me such terrible nightmares that I swore I would never touch it again, Lunesta gave me terrible breath, and Rozerem didn’t so squat. I would approach ALL these drugs with caution.\nI *did* see a neurologist whom I respected who recommended melatonin. She said you can double or even triple the dose and it should make you sleepy. Which I do, and it does, but though it makes you sleeepy, that doesn’t always translate to falling asleep. Please use at your own risk and don’t take my word for it — ask your doctor!\n*How’s your mood? Post-stroke depression is pretty common. It interferes with your sleep and your energy. If you’re depressed, she will most certainly put you on anti-depressants. In my case, this was a godsend; I eventually tried Wellbutrin, which woke me up when nothing else would. Hooray!\n*How’s your energy? In my case, it was terrible. I felt like one of those mosquitos that got stuck in amber and eventually suffocated. My physiatrist tried a whole bunch of stuff — Ritalin, Adderall, modanifil, Aricept — most of which either didn’t work, make me suicidally depressed (that was modanifil), or made me feel “weird”. It wasn’t until I discovered Wellbutrin that I began to feel like myself again!\nTen years after all *that* went by, I discovered a doctor in Chicago who treats the brain by treating your eyes. The whole story is outlined in the book “The Ghost In My Brain” by Clark Elliott, but the bottom line is that her method WORKS. I have even had some days where I feel like a 9/10 — the best I’ve felt since the strokes, about three times better than I felt right after the strokes, and twice as good as I ever expected to feel again. Her name is Dr. Zelinsky. Please check her out!"}

{"_id": "b439a424", "question": "What is an ischemic stroke in the pons?", "answers": "The pons is a very important part of the brain stem. It is an important pathway for messages traveling from the brain to other parts of the body and for messages from other parts of the body traveling to the brain. The pons has many important structures including the cranial nerve nuclei that help in movement of the facial nerves, detecting sensations on the face and also help in movement of the eyes. The cerebellum which is the balance center of the brain also communic extensively with the pons.\nThe pons is supplied by an important main artery called the basilar artery and it's branches called the perforators.\nAn overwhelming majority of ischemic strokes to the pons entail blockage of these perforators and produce a variety of symptoms depending on the area that is damaged. Usually there is weakness of one side of the face causing a facial droop, weakness of one side of the body (paralysis) imbalance and difficulty swallowing. Patients tend to do better with rehabilitation\nRarely, the main arter, the basilar artery may get blocked causing a devastating stroke causing a locked in syndrome wherein the entire body is paralyzed except for the ability to move the eyes up and down."}
{"_id": "08d5e767", "question": "Why is ischemic stroke more likely in Covid-19 than respiratory flu patients?", "answers": "Very good question, lets explore this further, for example, an early study focused on cerebrovascular disease (CVD),\nin a cohort of 219 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 11 (5.0%) developed new onset of CVD following COVID-19 infection. Of these patients, 10 (90.9%) were diagnosed with ischaemic stroke and 1 (9.1%) had intracerebral haemorrhage.\nAnother study\nwhich got the attention of doctors came from New York, Dr. Thomas Oxley wasn’t even on call the day he received the page to come to Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. There weren’t enough doctors to treat all the emergency stroke patients, and he was needed in the operating room.\nThe patient’s chart appeared unremarkable at first glance. He took no medications and had no history of chronic conditions. He had been feeling fine, hanging out at home during the lockdown like the rest of the country, when suddenly, he had trouble talking and moving the right side of his body. Imaging showed a large blockage on the left side of his head.\nOxley gasped when he got to the patient’s age and covid-19 status: 44, positive.\nThe man was among several recent stroke patients in their 30s to 40s who were all infected with the coronavirus. The median age for that type of severe stroke is 74.\nAs Oxley, an interventional neurologist, began the procedure to remove the clot, he observed something he had never seen before. On the monitors, the brain typically shows up as a tangle of black squiggles — “like a can of spaghetti,” he said — that provide a map of blood vessels. A clot shows up as a blank spot. As he used a needlelike device to pull out the clot, he saw new clots forming in real-time around it.\n“This is crazy,” he remembers telling his boss.\nCommon laboratory findings in patients with coronavirus disease COVID-19 are very revealing and could help us understand a mechanism of Ischemic stroke.\nLymphopenia, a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, is a common lab finding in confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as neutrophilia, an increase in circulating neutrophils. Elevated serum ALT and AST, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated CRP and elevated ferritin levels are associated with more severe disease. Elevated D-dimer, rising levels of Procalcitonin are other findings in severe cases.\nInflammation has been increasingly recognized as a key contributor to the pathophysiology of CVDs and involved in the acute intravascular events triggered by the interruption of the blood supply. Several studies have reported the elevated levels of C-reactive proteins (CRPs) and D-dimer in patients with the coexistence of COVID-19.\nCaveats to summarize the findings:\nLymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyperstimulated macrophages and neutrophils.\nNeutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Platelet-Lymphocyte ratio (PLR) correlate with thrombus burden in Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVM) and predicts Large Vessel Occlusions (LVO) that causes the deadliest type of stroke. Angiopoietins could be playing a significant role in blood and lymphatic endothelial cells (EC), in particular, Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) expression is triggered by inflammatory mediators, such as thrombin, and conditions, such as hypoxia and cancer. Angiopoietin also plays a role in smooth muscle cells, and microvascular thrombosis.\nWhile the role of Ang2 in regulating angiogenesis and vascular integrity has been well recognized, elevated serum angiopoietin-2 and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been implicated as biomarkers in the role in inflammation, in particular, Ang2 expression is increased dramatically at the sites of endothelial activation and is induced by various cytokines. Ang2 plays a critical role in hypoxia-induced lung injury and inflammation. Ang2 blockage inhibited expression of EC adhesion molecules, can improve blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity.\nElevated serum ferritin levels in severe or critically ill patients is definitely an interesting biomarker as this could explain regulated cell death via a process called ferroptosis. Iron-mediated oxidative stress has been implicated in a wide variety of neurological disorders, including hemorrhagic stroke, Alzheimer, Parkinson and diffuse Lewy body diseases.\nIn COVID-19 cases human airway epithelial-endothelial cells (air-blood barrier) were interrupted by lipid signals, such as 15-HpETE-PE, which plays a triggering role in ferroptosis. ACE2 receptors are also expressed by both cells, with evidence of direct viral infection of the endothelial cell and diffuse endothelial inflammation leading to cell death.\nAs the SARS-CoV viral load increases in the body, not only does it affect the immune system, it “attacks” via the ACE2 receptors, aided by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease, it affects cells in lungs, kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract, leading to multi-organ dysfunction. It also affects the red blood cells, causing hypoxia.\nAutophagy is activated in suboptimal conditions such as hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) or amino acid starvation. Alterations in oxygenation are common, reducing cell viability including by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and oxidative stress, leading to irreversible oxidation and damage of proteins, DNA and lipids, release of cyctochrome c and activation of apoptotic pathways.\nFurther analysis also show that many targets of autophagy modulators are involved in apoptosis (e.g. p53, Bcl-2, and caspase 8), necroptosis (e.g. caspase 8, RIPK1, and TNF), and ferroptosis (e.g. p53, 15LOX, and ACSL4) pathways.\nBrain swelling in the cortex/hippocampal region is also found to contain higher iron levels. As the iron chelator, Deferoxamine (DFX), reduces brain swelling induced by hemoglobin, iron appears to be an important factor in hemoglobin-induced injury. Cellular edema may contribute to brain swelling, but the main form of edema formation after Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is vasogenic brain edema. Studies have shown that hemoglobin can cause death of endothelial cells and a significant disruption of the BBB. This explains why Glucocorticoids, particularly, Dexamethasone (Dex) works well in severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients, coordinately regulating, an increase in angiopoietin-1 and decrease in VEGF thereby stabilizing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to an attenuation of vasogenic brain edema. Angiopoietin-1 protects neurons by inhibiting autophagy after neuronal oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery injury from apoptosis.\nIn one recent study, Dex attenuated the elevated nitric oxide production and decreased the inducible isoform nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) mRNA expression by kainate treatment, possibly acting as a free radical scavenger.\nAfter ischemic stroke, cytotoxic edema is first observed within a few hours and then declines within 1 day. Conversely, vasogenic edema forms within two to three days and is maintained for several days, after ICH.\nSince the oxygen-glucose supply for brain cells is remarkably diminished by deterioration of the blood brain flow after cerebral ischemia, which causes a drop in intracellular ATP production, and pH, switching to anaerobic glycolysis with lactic acid production. We hypothesize the electron transport respiratory chain is disrupted by mitochondrial dysfunction. This could also explain cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors in older patients.\nPharmacological interventions in the Future\nTo date there have been no clinical studies on Edaravone in COVID-19.\nEdaravone has been implicated as a safe and effective drug for acute ischemic stroke according to studies conducted by the COCRANE review in a cohort of 496 participants.\nSince Edaravone has a similar pharmacological mechanism in ischemic stroke to Dex, we highly recommend a study of this drug in severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19.\nThe following combination therapies could prove to be effective in prolonging the quality of life.\nEdaravone + Anti-viral (lipinovir/ritonavir)\nor\nEdaravone + Deferoxamine (DFX)\nor\nEdaravone + Dex (Patient with Diabetes)\nor\nEdaravone + Ang2 inhibitor (Patient with Heart disease)"}
{"_id": "a65b03f7", "question": "What is the difference between a hemorrhagic stroke, an ischemic stroke, and a transient ischemia stroke?", "answers": "There are changing names for these things but I will try to answer\nA stroke is an infarction of brain tissue killing it in the center of the tissue and leaving a margin around the death of semi living tissue. Strokes have different causes. Ischemic , lack of oxygen , or embolic, also lack of oxygen but caused by a small clot that flew into the brain artery and blocked blood flow. Tumors and foreign bodies can cause blockages as well.\nIf this blockage lasts more than about 15 minutes it it pretty certain that part of the brain tissue will die. Dead brain means loss of the nerves in that part of the brain.\nHow long does this blockage last ?\nDoes the part of the brain have some rapid alternative blood supply?\nWill the clot dissolve before it kills brain tissue and restores some blood supply. ?\nWhat happens to dead brain tissue ?\nA Reversible Ischemic neurological deficit (RIND, or TIA,). Has usually meant that neurological loss is temporary and has mostly recovered to normal within 24 hours. ( this may be old school speak ).\nA completed Stroke is a neurological deficit that lasts more than 24 hours. It may change and improve a bit but it leaves residual neurological loss .\nHemorrhagic stroke can be several things.\nThe dead tissue bleeds into itself or expands and hurts other tissue\nThe small brain artery actually bursts and blood into brain tissue that expands and puts pressure on normal brain tissue. This is often because of a brain aneurism. ( like a small defect in the Artery that forms a balloon in the vessel and it bursts )"}
{"_id": "c31705e0", "question": "What is the average lifespan of an ischemic stroke victim?", "answers": "The causes are blood clots blocking blood flow in the brain.

Hence, we do the CT or MRI (depending on indications and contraindications) before deciding on definitive treatment/doing course correction in emergency management.\nFor the second question\nAnswer- NO\nDetails- No, because we don't know the type of stroke, and giving aspirin to a patient of hemorrhagic stroke can be catastrophic.

{"_id": "4e1ecb4d", "question": "Is there a link between sinusitis and ischemic stroke?", "answers": "I believe so, yes.\nSinusitis can cause man you problems. My cousin had it so bad that his eyes were nearly pushed out of his skull and surgeons had to place a drain in his forehead to remove pus and keep the swelling to a minimum.\nBut in the case of it being the possible cause of an ischemic stroke, I can see how it’s possible. Due to the buildup of pressure in the skull, disrupting blood flow to the brain.\nI think there are studies on this, too, but I can’t look them up right now. I remember reading one that said CRS (Chronic Rhinosinusitis) does, in fact, raise the risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. I think it said something about the patient’s age not mattering, either - that it can cause these problems whether you’re young and healthy, or old and vulnerable."}
