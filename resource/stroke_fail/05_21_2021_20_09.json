Its always a got idea to fix the problem so it doesn't get worse but if for instance you start treating the problem at age 60 don't expect any of the damage to repair itself\n5)Diabetis- (or even worse Metabolic syndrome) generally one doesn't wake up one day to find that they are diabetic. Usually you were on that road for a long time. So now it's time to get off that road. Diet and exercise. Yes, taking medication helps but I don't think you are going to reverse the damage with medication just slow it down\n6)Hyperlidemia- sometimes genetic (see #2) but mostly due to bad diet and lifestyle choices (see #5)\n7)Smoking- you would probably have to live in a cave and be illiterate to not know that smoking was killing you\n\nso if you have arrived at the point where you now have ischaemic heart disease it is a little late to start thinking about reversing the process but here are a few things you can do;\nA) diet- but you knew that already\nB)exercise- made infinitely harder to do safely now that you have heart disease\nC)antiplatelet drugs- to prevent clots forming in the narrow arteries.

Strokes and ischemic heart disease are related to the extent that they are a manifestation of the same disease affecting arteries essentially, which is frequently atherosclerosis.", "High blood pressure causes your blood vessels to thicken and become stiff, which puts stress on the heart and can lead to heart disease. A stroke can occur as a result of failing to treat hypertension, so it is important to be aware of your risk factors and get your blood pressure checked regularly. High blood pressure and stroke High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most significant risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure refers to the pressure inside the arteries.

Now you need to know the the inner layer of a vessel, called endothelium, does not trigger a thrombus formation. The rupture of a plaque exposes the external layers of the wall of an artery to blood, clotting happens, as there is many chemicals that triggers it ( the same happens when you get a wound) and closes the artery further. All colors of the spectrum can be observed, from a completely and acutely blocked artery giving rise to an acute coronary syndrome to a relatively tolerated partial block to an extent, patient is happy when resting and in pain when making effort described as a stable angina.", "To conclude, yes!! Strokes and ischemic heart disease are related to the extent that they are a manifestation of the same disease affecting arteries essentially, which is frequently atherosclerosis.", "High blood pressure causes your blood vessels to thicken and become stiff, which puts stress on the heart and can lead to heart disease. A stroke can occur as a result of failing to treat hypertension, so it is important to be aware of your risk factors and get your blood pressure checked regularly. High blood pressure and stroke High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most significant risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure refers to the pressure inside the arteries. Normal blood pressure is around 120/80, while high-normal blood pressure is 120/80 to 140/90. Desiree Arnold"]}

Yes, taking medication helps but I don't think you are going to reverse the damage with medication just slow it down\n6)Hyperlidemia- sometimes genetic (see #2) but mostly due to bad diet and lifestyle choices (see #5)\n7)Smoking- you would probably have to live in a cave and be illiterate to not know that smoking was killing you\n\nso if you have arrived at the point where you now have ischaemic heart disease it is a little late to start thinking about reversing the process but here are a few things you can do;\nA) diet- but you knew that already\nB)exercise- made infinitely harder to do safely now that you have heart disease\nC)antiplatelet drugs- to prevent clots forming in the narrow arteries.

Yes, taking medication helps but I don't think you are going to reverse the damage with medication just slow it down\n6)Hyperlidemia- sometimes genetic (see #2) but mostly due to bad diet and lifestyle choices (see #5)\n7)Smoking- you would probably have to live in a cave and be illiterate to not know that smoking was killing you\n\nso if you have arrived at the point where you now have ischaemic heart disease it is a little late to start thinking about reversing the process but here are a few things you can do;\nA) diet- but you knew that already\nB)exercise- made infinitely harder to do safely now that you have heart disease\nC)antiplatelet drugs- to prevent clots forming in the narrow arteries.

Strokes and ischemic heart disease are related to the extent that they are a manifestation of the same disease affecting arteries essentially, which is frequently atherosclerosis.", "High blood pressure causes your blood vessels to thicken and become stiff, which puts stress on the heart and can lead to heart disease. A stroke can occur as a result of failing to treat hypertension, so it is important to be aware of your risk factors and get your blood pressure checked regularly.

Yes, taking medication helps but I don't think you are going to reverse the damage with medication just slow it down\n6)Hyperlidemia- sometimes genetic (see #2) but mostly due to bad diet and lifestyle choices (see #5)\n7)Smoking- you would probably have to live in a cave and be illiterate to not know that smoking was killing you\n\nso if you have arrived at the point where you now have ischaemic heart disease it is a little late to start thinking about reversing the process but here are a few things you can do;\nA) diet- but you knew that already\nB)exercise- made infinitely harder to do safely now that you have heart disease\nC)antiplatelet drugs- to prevent clots forming in the narrow arteries.

Strokes and ischemic heart disease are related to the extent that they are a manifestation of the same disease affecting arteries essentially, which is frequently atherosclerosis.", "High blood pressure causes your blood vessels to thicken and become stiff, which puts stress on the heart and can lead to heart disease. A stroke can occur as a result of failing to treat hypertension, so it is important to be aware of your risk factors and get your blood pressure checked regularly. High blood pressure and stroke High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most significant risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure refers to the pressure inside the arteries.

If a person suffers from any stroke, then certain life changes need to be made in order to avoid getting any more. If you are very lucky then it may not do permanent damage.

Instead, head to Netflix and watch “The Magic Pill”, a documentary about ancestral and ketogenic diets, then go try it out. The documentary’s name is based on the fact that a ketogenic diet partially or completely reverses most chronic illnesses, including every affliction you mention in your question (well, it can’t un-do strokes, but it is protective against strokes). Basically, ketosis un-does the damage caused by eating a Western diet (otherwise known as SAD or the Standard American Diet). Once you’ve been on keto for a while, you’ll see that you feel TONS better and will have a better idea of what exercises you’ll be able to do. If you are taking insulin for your diabetes, you’ll need to work with a doctor as your need for insulin will reduce rapidly in ketosis and some may even be able to completely stop injecting insulin altogether. You don’t mention if you have T1 or T2 diabetes, but I’m guessing the latter which can be COMPLETELY resolved using a ketogenic diet. Ketosis can’t fix T1 diabetes, but it can help DRAMATICALLY."]}

No way to fix that.\n2)Heredity- If you have bad genes you can't fix that ( special mention Arthur Ashe and Jin Fixx)\n3)Male sex (although women are catching up)- sorry even pulling a Bruce to Kaitlin doesn't fix this\n4)Hypertension- if you have had a lifetime of untreated hypertension then you have a lifetime of damage. Its always a got idea to fix the problem so it doesn't get worse but if for instance you start treating the problem at age 60 don't expect any of the damage to repair itself\n5)Diabetis- (or even worse Metabolic syndrome) generally one doesn't wake up one day to find that they are diabetic. Usually you were on that road for a long time. So now it's time to get off that road. Diet and exercise. Yes, taking medication helps but I don't think you are going to reverse the damage with medication just slow it down\n6)Hyperlidemia- sometimes genetic (see #2) but mostly due to bad diet and lifestyle choices (see #5)\n7)Smoking- you would probably have to live in a cave and be illiterate to not know that smoking was killing you\n\nso if you have arrived at the point where you now have ischaemic heart disease it is a little late to start thinking about reversing the process but here are a few things you can do;\nA) diet- but you knew that already\nB)exercise- made infinitely harder to do safely now that you have heart disease\nC)antiplatelet drugs- to prevent clots forming in the narrow arteries. It doesn't reverse anything but it does prevent an MI or stroke\nD)lipid lowering drugs- but wouldn't it be better if you had done the diet and exercise thing\nE)Omega Fatty Acids- seem to help\n\nI am not sure where the concern that diet and exercise is going to cause you to have a stroke?", "Are there specific CPT codes for stroke and heart disease to report to my insurance company claim that covers stroke and heart disease?", "There are two different sets of codes.

If a person suffers from any stroke, then certain life changes need to be made in order to avoid getting any more. If you are very lucky then it may not do permanent damage.

Instead, head to Netflix and watch “The Magic Pill”, a documentary about ancestral and ketogenic diets, then go try it out. The documentary’s name is based on the fact that a ketogenic diet partially or completely reverses most chronic illnesses, including every affliction you mention in your question (well, it can’t un-do strokes, but it is protective against strokes). Basically, ketosis un-does the damage caused by eating a Western diet (otherwise known as SAD or the Standard American Diet). Once you’ve been on keto for a while, you’ll see that you feel TONS better and will have a better idea of what exercises you’ll be able to do. If you are taking insulin for your diabetes, you’ll need to work with a doctor as your need for insulin will reduce rapidly in ketosis and some may even be able to completely stop injecting insulin altogether. You don’t mention if you have T1 or T2 diabetes, but I’m guessing the latter which can be COMPLETELY resolved using a ketogenic diet. Ketosis can’t fix T1 diabetes, but it can help DRAMATICALLY."]}

Examples of hypokinetic diseases are obesity, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. Those individuals that don't exercise are at greater risk of these conditions.

Heart disease is caused by narrowing and atherosclerosis of the coronary vessels. Stroke is caused by the same disease process to the blood vessels to the brain.

So what are these factors?\n\n1) Age- the older you get the higher the risk. No way to fix that.\n2)Heredity- If you have bad genes you can't fix that ( special mention Arthur Ashe and Jin Fixx)\n3)Male sex (although women are catching up)- sorry even pulling a Bruce to Kaitlin doesn't fix this\n4)Hypertension- if you have had a lifetime of untreated hypertension then you have a lifetime of damage. Its always a got idea to fix the problem so it doesn't get worse but if for instance you start treating the problem at age 60 don't expect any of the damage to repair itself\n5)Diabetis- (or even worse Metabolic syndrome) generally one doesn't wake up one day to find that they are diabetic. Usually you were on that road for a long time. So now it's time to get off that road. Diet and exercise. Yes, taking medication helps but I don't think you are going to reverse the damage with medication just slow it down\n6)Hyperlidemia- sometimes genetic (see #2) but mostly due to bad diet and lifestyle choices (see #5)\n7)Smoking- you would probably have to live in a cave and be illiterate to not know that smoking was killing you\n\nso if you have arrived at the point where you now have ischaemic heart disease it is a little late to start thinking about reversing the process but here are a few things you can do;\nA) diet- but you knew that already\nB)exercise- made infinitely harder to do safely now that you have heart disease\nC)antiplatelet drugs- to prevent clots forming in the narrow arteries. It doesn't reverse anything but it does prevent an MI or stroke\nD)lipid lowering drugs- but wouldn't it be better if you had done the diet and exercise thing\nE)Omega Fatty Acids- seem to help\n\nI am not sure where the concern that diet and exercise is going to cause you to have a stroke?", "Are there specific CPT codes for stroke and heart disease to report to my insurance company claim that covers stroke and heart disease?", "There are two different sets of codes. One, the CPT is for Procedures . The other,the ICD-10, is the current coding list for diagnoses.

The CPT is only for procedure. It does, however, provide codes for procedures associated with heart disease and strokes, such as CT scans or blood tests or other diagnostic or corrective procedures ( including, as a worst case scenario, a heart transplant).

Now you need to know the the inner layer of a vessel, called endothelium, does not trigger a thrombus formation. The rupture of a plaque exposes the external layers of the wall of an artery to blood, clotting happens, as there is many chemicals that triggers it ( the same happens when you get a wound) and closes the artery further. All colors of the spectrum can be observed, from a completely and acutely blocked artery giving rise to an acute coronary syndrome to a relatively tolerated partial block to an extent, patient is happy when resting and in pain when making effort described as a stable angina.", "To conclude, yes!! Strokes and ischemic heart disease are related to the extent that they are a manifestation of the same disease affecting arteries essentially, which is frequently atherosclerosis.", "High blood pressure causes your blood vessels to thicken and become stiff, which puts stress on the heart and can lead to heart disease. A stroke can occur as a result of failing to treat hypertension, so it is important to be aware of your risk factors and get your blood pressure checked regularly. High blood pressure and stroke High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most significant risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure refers to the pressure inside the arteries. Normal blood pressure is around 120/80, while high-normal blood pressure is 120/80 to 140/90.

Basically, ketosis un-does the damage caused by eating a Western diet (otherwise known as SAD or the Standard American Diet). Once you’ve been on keto for a while, you’ll see that you feel TONS better and will have a better idea of what exercises you’ll be able to do. If you are taking insulin for your diabetes, you’ll need to work with a doctor as your need for insulin will reduce rapidly in ketosis and some may even be able to completely stop injecting insulin altogether.

So what are these factors?\n\n1) Age- the older you get the higher the risk. No way to fix that.\n2)Heredity- If you have bad genes you can't fix that ( special mention Arthur Ashe and Jin Fixx)\n3)Male sex (although women are catching up)- sorry even pulling a Bruce to Kaitlin doesn't fix this\n4)Hypertension- if you have had a lifetime of untreated hypertension then you have a lifetime of damage. Its always a got idea to fix the problem so it doesn't get worse but if for instance you start treating the problem at age 60 don't expect any of the damage to repair itself\n5)Diabetis- (or even worse Metabolic syndrome) generally one doesn't wake up one day to find that they are diabetic. Usually you were on that road for a long time. So now it's time to get off that road. Diet and exercise. Yes, taking medication helps but I don't think you are going to reverse the damage with medication just slow it down\n6)Hyperlidemia- sometimes genetic (see #2) but mostly due to bad diet and lifestyle choices (see #5)\n7)Smoking- you would probably have to live in a cave and be illiterate to not know that smoking was killing you\n\nso if you have arrived at the point where you now have ischaemic heart disease it is a little late to start thinking about reversing the process but here are a few things you can do;\nA) diet- but you knew that already\nB)exercise- made infinitely harder to do safely now that you have heart disease\nC)antiplatelet drugs- to prevent clots forming in the narrow arteries. It doesn't reverse anything but it does prevent an MI or stroke\nD)lipid lowering drugs- but wouldn't it be better if you had done the diet and exercise thing\nE)Omega Fatty Acids- seem to help\n\nI am not sure where the concern that diet and exercise is going to cause you to have a stroke?", "Are there specific CPT codes for stroke and heart disease to report to my insurance company claim that covers stroke and heart disease?", "There are two different sets of codes. One, the CPT is for Procedures . The other,the ICD-10, is the current coding list for diagnoses. Both provide codes for heart disease and strokes ( both bleeding into the brain and vessel blockage type strokes).

This is only an example and may not include your specific diagnosis. The ICD-10 has only been in current usage for 6 months, although it’s been available for about 18 months. It takes time for the billing and coding folks to change over from one set to another and this latest set is much more complex than the older one ( the ICD-9).", "The CPT is only used for billing procedures performed, not diagnoses, but they are supposed to (sort of) match. You shouldn’t code for treating a broken leg and a diagnosis of kidney disease on the same bill.

The CPT is only for procedure. It does, however, provide codes for procedures associated with heart disease and strokes, such as CT scans or blood tests or other diagnostic or corrective procedures ( including, as a worst case scenario, a heart transplant). It does not describe or code for the actual diagnosis.", "Confused? You’re not the only one, including some billing and coding clerks.

Now you need to know the the inner layer of a vessel, called endothelium, does not trigger a thrombus formation. The rupture of a plaque exposes the external layers of the wall of an artery to blood, clotting happens, as there is many chemicals that triggers it ( the same happens when you get a wound) and closes the artery further. All colors of the spectrum can be observed, from a completely and acutely blocked artery giving rise to an acute coronary syndrome to a relatively tolerated partial block to an extent, patient is happy when resting and in pain when making effort described as a stable angina.", "To conclude, yes!! Strokes and ischemic heart disease are related to the extent that they are a manifestation of the same disease affecting arteries essentially, which is frequently atherosclerosis.", "High blood pressure causes your blood vessels to thicken and become stiff, which puts stress on the heart and can lead to heart disease. A stroke can occur as a result of failing to treat hypertension, so it is important to be aware of your risk factors and get your blood pressure checked regularly. High blood pressure and stroke High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most significant risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure refers to the pressure inside the arteries. Normal blood pressure is around 120/80, while high-normal blood pressure is 120/80 to 140/90.

If a person suffers from any stroke, then certain life changes need to be made in order to avoid getting any more. If you are very lucky then it may not do permanent damage.

Basically, ketosis un-does the damage caused by eating a Western diet (otherwise known as SAD or the Standard American Diet). Once you’ve been on keto for a while, you’ll see that you feel TONS better and will have a better idea of what exercises you’ll be able to do. If you are taking insulin for your diabetes, you’ll need to work with a doctor as your need for insulin will reduce rapidly in ketosis and some may even be able to completely stop injecting insulin altogether.

With strokes it is how severely a person is affected. This can vary enormously. Mini strokes do not usually do so much harm. A major stroke could disable you for life. There are many degrees of seriousness in between. Any stroke has to be taken seriously though. A person can get a series of strokes. If a person suffers from any stroke, then certain life changes need to be made in order to avoid getting any more. If you are very lucky then it may not do permanent damage. Sometimes people recover, and regain their faculties. Unfortunately this is not always the case. There's no way of predicting how much harm a stroke may do.

Basically, ketosis un-does the damage caused by eating a Western diet (otherwise known as SAD or the Standard American Diet). Once you’ve been on keto for a while, you’ll see that you feel TONS better and will have a better idea of what exercises you’ll be able to do. If you are taking insulin for your diabetes, you’ll need to work with a doctor as your need for insulin will reduce rapidly in ketosis and some may even be able to completely stop injecting insulin altogether.

Heart disease is caused by narrowing and atherosclerosis of the coronary vessels. Stroke is caused by the same disease process to the blood vessels to the brain.

So what are these factors?\n\n1) Age- the older you get the higher the risk. No way to fix that.\n2)Heredity- If you have bad genes you can't fix that ( special mention Arthur Ashe and Jin Fixx)\n3)Male sex (although women are catching up)- sorry even pulling a Bruce to Kaitlin doesn't fix this\n4)Hypertension- if you have had a lifetime of untreated hypertension then you have a lifetime of damage. Its always a got idea to fix the problem so it doesn't get worse but if for instance you start treating the problem at age 60 don't expect any of the damage to repair itself\n5)Diabetis- (or even worse Metabolic syndrome) generally one doesn't wake up one day to find that they are diabetic. Usually you were on that road for a long time. So now it's time to get off that road. Diet and exercise. Yes, taking medication helps but I don't think you are going to reverse the damage with medication just slow it down\n6)Hyperlidemia- sometimes genetic (see #2) but mostly due to bad diet and lifestyle choices (see #5)\n7)Smoking- you would probably have to live in a cave and be illiterate to not know that smoking was killing you\n\nso if you have arrived at the point where you now have ischaemic heart disease it is a little late to start thinking about reversing the process but here are a few things you can do;\nA) diet- but you knew that already\nB)exercise- made infinitely harder to do safely now that you have heart disease\nC)antiplatelet drugs- to prevent clots forming in the narrow arteries. It doesn't reverse anything but it does prevent an MI or stroke\nD)lipid lowering drugs- but wouldn't it be better if you had done the diet and exercise thing\nE)Omega Fatty Acids- seem to help\n\nI am not sure where the concern that diet and exercise is going to cause you to have a stroke?", "Are there specific CPT codes for stroke and heart disease to report to my insurance company claim that covers stroke and heart disease?", "There are two different sets of codes. One, the CPT is for Procedures . The other,the ICD-10, is the current coding list for diagnoses. Both provide codes for heart disease and strokes ( both bleeding into the brain and vessel blockage type strokes).

The CPT is only for procedure. It does, however, provide codes for procedures associated with heart disease and strokes, such as CT scans or blood tests or other diagnostic or corrective procedures ( including, as a worst case scenario, a heart transplant). It does not describe or code for the actual diagnosis.", "Confused? You’re not the only one, including some billing and coding clerks.

Now you need to know the the inner layer of a vessel, called endothelium, does not trigger a thrombus formation. The rupture of a plaque exposes the external layers of the wall of an artery to blood, clotting happens, as there is many chemicals that triggers it ( the same happens when you get a wound) and closes the artery further. All colors of the spectrum can be observed, from a completely and acutely blocked artery giving rise to an acute coronary syndrome to a relatively tolerated partial block to an extent, patient is happy when resting and in pain when making effort described as a stable angina.", "To conclude, yes!! Strokes and ischemic heart disease are related to the extent that they are a manifestation of the same disease affecting arteries essentially, which is frequently atherosclerosis.", "High blood pressure causes your blood vessels to thicken and become stiff, which puts stress on the heart and can lead to heart disease. A stroke can occur as a result of failing to treat hypertension, so it is important to be aware of your risk factors and get your blood pressure checked regularly. High blood pressure and stroke High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most significant risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure refers to the pressure inside the arteries.

In computer science, the AI algorithms that were used are called 'random forest', 'logistic regression', 'gradient boosting' and 'neural networks'.", "Dr Stephen Weng, from the university's NIHR School for Primary Care Research, said: \"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of illness and death worldwide. Our study shows that artificial intelligence could significantly help in the fight against it by improving the number of patients accurately identified as being at high risk and allowing for early intervention by doctors to prevent serious events like cardiac arrest and stroke.", "\"Current standard prediction models like the ACC are based on eight risk factors including age, cholesterol level and blood pressure but are too simplistic to account for other factors like medications, multiple disease conditions, and other non-traditional biomarkers. These AI algorithms have the potential to help save more lives\".", "Professor Jon Garibaldi and Dr Jenna Reps, of the Advanced Data Analysis Centre in the School of Computer Science, said: \"We were curious to find out how four modern machine learning algorithms would perform given the large data set of 378,256 patients from nearly 700 UK GP practices. Indeed, we think this is the first large scale investigation of this type using routine clinical data.", "\"Our results show that 24,970 cardiovascular events occurred over a 10 year follow-up period. Compared to the established risk prediction algorithm, all four algorithms improved overall prediction accuracy, from 1.7% to 3.6%, as determined by a metric called the 'Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve'. The highest achieving algorithm (neural networks) correctly predicted 7.6% more patients who eventually developed cardiovascular disease compared to the standard algorithm.\"", "The study concludes that the improved predictions offered by self-teaching algorithms are better at predicting the absolute number of cardiovascular disease cases correctly, while successfully excluding non-cases. The research team believes AI has a crucial role to play in the devising of healthcare tools of the future which will deliver personalised medicine, tailoring risk management to individual patients.", "The team says improvement in predictive accuracy could be further explored using machine learning with other large clinical datasets, in other populations, and in predicting other disease outcomes. But future investigation of the feasibility and acceptability of machine-learning applications in clinical practice is needed before any real life clinical application of this new technology is rolled out.", "“CodesRoom” Provides trainer for AI Development to increase professionals in the world.", "Modern people in many places (including the US) have some ‘mixed’ ancestry if you define that as having genetic variation derived from more than one distant place (like Europe, India, Asia, Africa). This is because there has long been some inter-breeding (and the populations aren’t totally isolated from each other). So the 2–5% figure is no surprise but even that depends on first defining what counts as ‘Neanderthal’. Neanderthals, for example, were just Europeans at some particular time in the past that we, as anthropologists, define by giving them a name.", "Every region’s genomic variation includes some that involves susceptibility to diseases, usually also depending on lifestyle factors (like diet). So there is nothing particularly risky about ‘Neanderthal’ DNA compared to other DNA. The kinds of late-onset diseases that you mention are mainly affected by lifestyles and we know that a lot of that is recent and has nothing to do with distant ancestry. Further, as these diseases generally strike late in life, and most humans in the Neanderthal (and, indeed, until recent) times didn’t live long enough to get them, so they basically aren’t ‘disease’ genes (and, technically, you should refer to disease-susceptibility genotypes or alleles in some copies of genes, not ‘genes’ themselves).", "So, generally, there are many subtle assumptions built into your question, and are widespread in thinking and writing about these past times, but should be more carefully thought-out."]}

In computer science, the AI algorithms that were used are called 'random forest', 'logistic regression', 'gradient boosting' and 'neural networks'.", "Dr Stephen Weng, from the university's NIHR School for Primary Care Research, said: \"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of illness and death worldwide. Our study shows that artificial intelligence could significantly help in the fight against it by improving the number of patients accurately identified as being at high risk and allowing for early intervention by doctors to prevent serious events like cardiac arrest and stroke.", "\"Current standard prediction models like the ACC are based on eight risk factors including age, cholesterol level and blood pressure but are too simplistic to account for other factors like medications, multiple disease conditions, and other non-traditional biomarkers. These AI algorithms have the potential to help save more lives\".", "Professor Jon Garibaldi and Dr Jenna Reps, of the Advanced Data Analysis Centre in the School of Computer Science, said: \"We were curious to find out how four modern machine learning algorithms would perform given the large data set of 378,256 patients from nearly 700 UK GP practices. Indeed, we think this is the first large scale investigation of this type using routine clinical data.", "\"Our results show that 24,970 cardiovascular events occurred over a 10 year follow-up period. Compared to the established risk prediction algorithm, all four algorithms improved overall prediction accuracy, from 1.7% to 3.6%, as determined by a metric called the 'Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve'. The highest achieving algorithm (neural networks) correctly predicted 7.6% more patients who eventually developed cardiovascular disease compared to the standard algorithm.\"", "The study concludes that the improved predictions offered by self-teaching algorithms are better at predicting the absolute number of cardiovascular disease cases correctly, while successfully excluding non-cases. The research team believes AI has a crucial role to play in the devising of healthcare tools of the future which will deliver personalised medicine, tailoring risk management to individual patients.", "The team says improvement in predictive accuracy could be further explored using machine learning with other large clinical datasets, in other populations, and in predicting other disease outcomes. But future investigation of the feasibility and acceptability of machine-learning applications in clinical practice is needed before any real life clinical application of this new technology is rolled out.", "“CodesRoom” Provides trainer for AI Development to increase professionals in the world.", "Modern people in many places (including the US) have some ‘mixed’ ancestry if you define that as having genetic variation derived from more than one distant place (like Europe, India, Asia, Africa). This is because there has long been some inter-breeding (and the populations aren’t totally isolated from each other). So the 2–5% figure is no surprise but even that depends on first defining what counts as ‘Neanderthal’. Neanderthals, for example, were just Europeans at some particular time in the past that we, as anthropologists, define by giving them a name.", "Every region’s genomic variation includes some that involves susceptibility to diseases, usually also depending on lifestyle factors (like diet). So there is nothing particularly risky about ‘Neanderthal’ DNA compared to other DNA. The kinds of late-onset diseases that you mention are mainly affected by lifestyles and we know that a lot of that is recent and has nothing to do with distant ancestry. Further, as these diseases generally strike late in life, and most humans in the Neanderthal (and, indeed, until recent) times didn’t live long enough to get them, so they basically aren’t ‘disease’ genes (and, technically, you should refer to disease-susceptibility genotypes or alleles in some copies of genes, not ‘genes’ themselves).", "So, generally, there are many subtle assumptions built into your question, and are widespread in thinking and writing about these past times, but should be more carefully thought-out.", "It cannot only cause the feeling of dry mouth and dehydration it can cause actual dry mouth and dehydration.

Every cancer has a unique etiology and thus requires different modes of treatment. Because human bodies vary in so many ways, two people will not react exactly the same to the same regimen even if they are diagnosed with the same cancer type and stage. Also, while there can certainly be a genetic component or predisposition for a certain type of cancer, predisposition does not always equate manifestation. This is because inheriting a faulty gene may not be enough to trigger cancer; a series of genetic mutations must accumulate to develop into a diagnosable cancer. Most cancers have no known genetic predisposition. One thing people can do to lessen the chance of developing cancer is to quit smoking or never pick it up to begin with.", "Strokes and brain diseases—also very broad diseases.
