A stroke can occur as a result of failing to treat hypertension, so it is important to be aware of your risk factors and get your blood pressure checked regularly. High blood pressure and stroke High blood pressure (hypertension) is the most significant risk factor for stroke. Blood pressure refers to the pressure inside the arteries.

The primary source of this problem is much more likely to be damage to the lining of the blood vessels, which release clotting factors which in turn cause the platelet aggregation and therefore the clots which cause strokes and heart attacks in some cases. Perhaps a haematologist might give you a more definitive and up-to-the-minute answer.", "Early on in this pandemic, I thought that it was this damage to small blood vessels which was responsible for most of the effects on the lung, and resulted in the curious combination of low blood oxygen levels without much shortness of breath and the ease of artificial ventilation compared to other cases of viral pneumonia, which cause stiff lungs. However, I was wrong: the lack of shortness of breath seems to be due to an effect of the virus on the brain, while the relative ease of artificial ventilation is still unexplained.", "Tryglycerides, LDL Cholesterol,VLDL Cholesterol are bad for you.

And you need to realize that this is not a scientific publication per se. Instead, it is a news release from BGN Technologies, the technology transfer company of Ben-Gurion University. They are seeking long-term partnerships with multinational corporations that will invest in startups based on Ben-Gurion technologies. And as such, it is perhaps a wee bit overly optimistic about what this new approach may be able to accomplish ... many years from now.", "You can read what is apparently the one and only publication in a peer-reviewed journal at:", "Paroxysmal slow cortical activity in Alzheimer’s\ndisease\nand epilepsy is associated with blood-brain barrier dysfunction", "The paper’s section on limitations of the research is brief and to the point. \"This study holds a diagnostic and therapeutic promise; yet, it is limited by its retrospective nature, relatively small number of participants, and the absence of DCE-MRI scans and EEG recordings in the same patients with AD. Future prospective trials are required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this diagnostic measure. Combining EEG recordings with DCE-MRI, or other quantitative BBBd measure, is necessary to solidify the spatiotemporal relations between PSWEs and vascular pathology.”", "You may wish to read the comments on this paper posted on AlzForum by experts who are far more knowledgeable than I about the concepts and technologies associated with the research paper:", "NETWORKING FOR A CURE", "From what I’ve learned I believe avoiding inflammatory foods can make a difference in heart disease and risk of stroke... theoretically, in reality, I believe genetics and/or heredity is nearly equally important. Genetics in that a gene can be turned on or off and their siblings can be different since it is a switch and can be turned on/off nearly randomly. Hereditary when passed on by parents, grandparents (sometime skips a generation depending on type of gene or whether a dominant/recessive trait). Some people have a high toleration for some inflammatory foods/edibles and others are particularly sensitive to some substances. If you have some tissue that reacts to a substance and is weakened then it becomes easier for something else to penetrate the tissue and cause problems until it reaches a point that it dislodges and gets stuck somewhere else. Example is when cholesterol penetrates a weakened wall of an artery due to inflammation, changes form over time, then penetrates back into the artery and converts into a blood clot, which then gets stuck in a narrow passage. So avoiding inflammatory food should, theoretically, reduce the likelihood of this happening or reduce it to fewer incidences.", "Clinical evidence has shown that cervical spondylosis can cause sympathetic nerve irritation and associated sympathetic symptoms. And instability at the C4-C5 intervertebral space is the most common type causing sympathetic symptoms, rather than C1-C2. Could it happen at C1-C2? Yes, but it is not as common.", "Arrythmias and the Cervical Spine - Clark Chiropractic", "Responses should be considered general in nature, and not specific to any one person; consequently, they are not to be construed as specific medical advice and do not create a doctor/patient relationship.

They follow the rule of the Time Lords to not interfere in other races or in time itself. Which does not place them in much danger.

I would suspect that their technology level means that they can either treat or prevent most things like that really easily. Though it would not surprise me if there were some genetic diseases that only Gallifreyans get which we simply have not seen mentioned. The fifth Doctor had an ‘allergy to certain gases’ (given as an explanation for why he carried celery - it changed colour in the presence of those gases) and it would not surprise me if there were other diseases unique to Time Lord physiology. However, these things tend to be left vague so that future writers can add to the lore by making up new things."]}
