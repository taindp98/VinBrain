{"_id": "268ab7e1", "question": "What is an ischemic stroke?", "answers": "Blood carries oxygen through our bodies and we need oxygen to live. Any part of the body that doesn’t receive oxygen gets injured and begins to die. This is called ischemia.\nAn ischemic stroke is a type of stroke that happens when there is a blockage that builds up in the blood vessels of the brain preventing blood or oxygen from flowing.\nA blockage in blood vessels usually happens when it “clogs”.\nThe blood vessels to the brain are like pipes they carry water. Layers of mold and “gunk” can buildup over many years. The same kind of build-up can happen in a person’s arteries.\nArteries are the blood vessels that carry blood FROM the heart TO the brain.\nSimilar to the mold or “gunk” that clogs the pipes, there is far the clogs the arteries.\nThis is called atherosclerosis.\nSometimes the blockage builds up in the blood vessels of the chest or neck, which then breaks loose and travels up to the brain. This is called an embolus.

{"_id": "7b132071", "question": "What is the best neuroimaging modality for acute ischemic stroke?", "answers": "One of the most useful ways to image acute stroke is a combination of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) with perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI). Diffusion weighting is about actually imaging how \"free\" water molecules are in a certain region of tissue (and it depends on how much water there is as well). You can think of it as looking at tissue microstructure by evaluating how tissue water is behaving. When tissue dies and you have an ischemic infarct, diffusion goes way down. However, there are still areas surrounding the infarcted region that are viable but aren't getting sufficient blood perfusion. perfusion weighting helps show those regions, as it actually looks at how much fresh blood supply is entering into a region. Quickly re-perfusing those regions that are still viable but are inadequately perfused is critical to saving that tissue and preventing the lesion of infarcted tissue from growing, which increases chances for functional recovery. It's a very short time window to really help the stroke patient in this way at this acute phase ...\nSee: http://radiology-medical-imaging-technology.blogspot.com/2012/12/perfusion-imaging-of-infarct-and.html\nHere's a brief comparison between information you glean from DWI and information you glean from PWI in ischemic stroke:\n\n(from Part II: Modalities, input, and image processing see\nstroke\ndifferently\n)"}
{"_id": "20c62432", "question": "What is the best treatment for an ischemic stroke?", "answers": "Well, there are two timeframes for treatment: the acute phase (while you’re in the hospital) and afterwards.\nThe immediate treatment is TPA, if you’re eligible for it; that breaks up the clot. If you haven’t gotten to the hospital in time for TPA, the next best thing is heparin. Heparin prevent your blood from clotting and helps prevent any further clots from forming.\nOnce you’re out of the hospital, you’ll probably want to see a physiatrist (“rehab doctor”). She will ask you:\n*How’s your sleep? If it’s not good, she will probably prescribe one of several sleeping pills. N.B. That these did not help me; Ambien gave me such terrible nightmares that I swore I would never touch it again, Lunesta gave me terrible breath, and Rozerem didn’t so squat. I would approach ALL these drugs with caution.\nI *did* see a neurologist whom I respected who recommended melatonin. She said you can double or even triple the dose and it should make you sleepy. Which I do, and it does, but though it makes you sleeepy, that doesn’t always translate to falling asleep. Please use at your own risk and don’t take my word for it — ask your doctor!\n*How’s your mood? Post-stroke depression is pretty common. It interferes with your sleep and your energy. If you’re depressed, she will most certainly put you on anti-depressants. In my case, this was a godsend; I eventually tried Wellbutrin, which woke me up when nothing else would. Hooray!\n*How’s your energy? In my case, it was terrible. I felt like one of those mosquitos that got stuck in amber and eventually suffocated. My physiatrist tried a whole bunch of stuff — Ritalin, Adderall, modanifil, Aricept — most of which either didn’t work, make me suicidally depressed (that was modanifil), or made me feel “weird”. It wasn’t until I discovered Wellbutrin that I began to feel like myself again!\nTen years after all *that* went by, I discovered a doctor in Chicago who treats the brain by treating your eyes. The whole story is outlined in the book “The Ghost In My Brain” by Clark Elliott, but the bottom line is that her method WORKS. I have even had some days where I feel like a 9/10 — the best I’ve felt since the strokes, about three times better than I felt right after the strokes, and twice as good as I ever expected to feel again. Her name is Dr. Zelinsky. Please check her out!"}

{"_id": "ef39584d", "question": "What is an ischemic stroke in the pons?", "answers": "The pons is a very important part of the brain stem. It is an important pathway for messages traveling from the brain to other parts of the body and for messages from other parts of the body traveling to the brain. The pons has many important structures including the cranial nerve nuclei that help in movement of the facial nerves, detecting sensations on the face and also help in movement of the eyes. The cerebellum which is the balance center of the brain also communic extensively with the pons.\nThe pons is supplied by an important main artery called the basilar artery and it's branches called the perforators.\nAn overwhelming majority of ischemic strokes to the pons entail blockage of these perforators and produce a variety of symptoms depending on the area that is damaged. Usually there is weakness of one side of the face causing a facial droop, weakness of one side of the body (paralysis) imbalance and difficulty swallowing. Patients tend to do better with rehabilitation\nRarely, the main arter, the basilar artery may get blocked causing a devastating stroke causing a locked in syndrome wherein the entire body is paralyzed except for the ability to move the eyes up and down."}
{"_id": "fd2190cd", "question": "Why is ischemic stroke more likely in Covid-19 than respiratory flu patients?", "answers": "Very good question, lets explore this further, for example, an early study focused on cerebrovascular disease (CVD),\nin a cohort of 219 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 11 (5.0%) developed new onset of CVD following COVID-19 infection. Of these patients, 10 (90.9%) were diagnosed with ischaemic stroke and 1 (9.1%) had intracerebral haemorrhage.\nAnother study\nwhich got the attention of doctors came from New York, Dr. Thomas Oxley wasn’t even on call the day he received the page to come to Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. There weren’t enough doctors to treat all the emergency stroke patients, and he was needed in the operating room.\nThe patient’s chart appeared unremarkable at first glance. He took no medications and had no history of chronic conditions. He had been feeling fine, hanging out at home during the lockdown like the rest of the country, when suddenly, he had trouble talking and moving the right side of his body. Imaging showed a large blockage on the left side of his head.\nOxley gasped when he got to the patient’s age and covid-19 status: 44, positive.\nThe man was among several recent stroke patients in their 30s to 40s who were all infected with the coronavirus. The median age for that type of severe stroke is 74.\nAs Oxley, an interventional neurologist, began the procedure to remove the clot, he observed something he had never seen before. On the monitors, the brain typically shows up as a tangle of black squiggles — “like a can of spaghetti,” he said — that provide a map of blood vessels. A clot shows up as a blank spot. As he used a needlelike device to pull out the clot, he saw new clots forming in real-time around it.\n“This is crazy,” he remembers telling his boss.\nCommon laboratory findings in patients with coronavirus disease COVID-19 are very revealing and could help us understand a mechanism of Ischemic stroke.\nLymphopenia, a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, is a common lab finding in confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as neutrophilia, an increase in circulating neutrophils. Elevated serum ALT and AST, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated CRP and elevated ferritin levels are associated with more severe disease. Elevated D-dimer, rising levels of Procalcitonin are other findings in severe cases.\nInflammation has been increasingly recognized as a key contributor to the pathophysiology of CVDs and involved in the acute intravascular events triggered by the interruption of the blood supply. Several studies have reported the elevated levels of C-reactive proteins (CRPs) and D-dimer in patients with the coexistence of COVID-19.\nCaveats to summarize the findings:\nLymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyperstimulated macrophages and neutrophils.\nNeutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Platelet-Lymphocyte ratio (PLR) correlate with thrombus burden in Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVM) and predicts Large Vessel Occlusions (LVO) that causes the deadliest type of stroke. Angiopoietins could be playing a significant role in blood and lymphatic endothelial cells (EC), in particular, Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) expression is triggered by inflammatory mediators, such as thrombin, and conditions, such as hypoxia and cancer. Angiopoietin also plays a role in smooth muscle cells, and microvascular thrombosis.\nWhile the role of Ang2 in regulating angiogenesis and vascular integrity has been well recognized, elevated serum angiopoietin-2 and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been implicated as biomarkers in the role in inflammation, in particular, Ang2 expression is increased dramatically at the sites of endothelial activation and is induced by various cytokines. Ang2 plays a critical role in hypoxia-induced lung injury and inflammation. Ang2 blockage inhibited expression of EC adhesion molecules, can improve blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity.\nElevated serum ferritin levels in severe or critically ill patients is definitely an interesting biomarker as this could explain regulated cell death via a process called ferroptosis. Iron-mediated oxidative stress has been implicated in a wide variety of neurological disorders, including hemorrhagic stroke, Alzheimer, Parkinson and diffuse Lewy body diseases.\nIn COVID-19 cases human airway epithelial-endothelial cells (air-blood barrier) were interrupted by lipid signals, such as 15-HpETE-PE, which plays a triggering role in ferroptosis. ACE2 receptors are also expressed by both cells, with evidence of direct viral infection of the endothelial cell and diffuse endothelial inflammation leading to cell death.\nAs the SARS-CoV viral load increases in the body, not only does it affect the immune system, it “attacks” via the ACE2 receptors, aided by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease, it affects cells in lungs, kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract, leading to multi-organ dysfunction. It also affects the red blood cells, causing hypoxia.\nAutophagy is activated in suboptimal conditions such as hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) or amino acid starvation. Alterations in oxygenation are common, reducing cell viability including by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and oxidative stress, leading to irreversible oxidation and damage of proteins, DNA and lipids, release of cyctochrome c and activation of apoptotic pathways.\nFurther analysis also show that many targets of autophagy modulators are involved in apoptosis (e.g. p53, Bcl-2, and caspase 8), necroptosis (e.g. caspase 8, RIPK1, and TNF), and ferroptosis (e.g. p53, 15LOX, and ACSL4) pathways.\nBrain swelling in the cortex/hippocampal region is also found to contain higher iron levels. As the iron chelator, Deferoxamine (DFX), reduces brain swelling induced by hemoglobin, iron appears to be an important factor in hemoglobin-induced injury. Cellular edema may contribute to brain swelling, but the main form of edema formation after Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is vasogenic brain edema. Studies have shown that hemoglobin can cause death of endothelial cells and a significant disruption of the BBB. This explains why Glucocorticoids, particularly, Dexamethasone (Dex) works well in severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients, coordinately regulating, an increase in angiopoietin-1 and decrease in VEGF thereby stabilizing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to an attenuation of vasogenic brain edema. Angiopoietin-1 protects neurons by inhibiting autophagy after neuronal oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery injury from apoptosis.\nIn one recent study, Dex attenuated the elevated nitric oxide production and decreased the inducible isoform nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) mRNA expression by kainate treatment, possibly acting as a free radical scavenger.\nAfter ischemic stroke, cytotoxic edema is first observed within a few hours and then declines within 1 day. Conversely, vasogenic edema forms within two to three days and is maintained for several days, after ICH.\nSince the oxygen-glucose supply for brain cells is remarkably diminished by deterioration of the blood brain flow after cerebral ischemia, which causes a drop in intracellular ATP production, and pH, switching to anaerobic glycolysis with lactic acid production. We hypothesize the electron transport respiratory chain is disrupted by mitochondrial dysfunction. This could also explain cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors in older patients.\nPharmacological interventions in the Future\nTo date there have been no clinical studies on Edaravone in COVID-19.\nEdaravone has been implicated as a safe and effective drug for acute ischemic stroke according to studies conducted by the COCRANE review in a cohort of 496 participants.\nSince Edaravone has a similar pharmacological mechanism in ischemic stroke to Dex, we highly recommend a study of this drug in severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19.\nThe following combination therapies could prove to be effective in prolonging the quality of life.\nEdaravone + Anti-viral (lipinovir/ritonavir)\nor\nEdaravone + Deferoxamine (DFX)\nor\nEdaravone + Dex (Patient with Diabetes)\nor\nEdaravone + Ang2 inhibitor (Patient with Heart disease)"}
{"_id": "4af34093", "question": "What is the difference between a hemorrhagic stroke, an ischemic stroke, and a transient ischemia stroke?", "answers": "There are changing names for these things but I will try to answer\nA stroke is an infarction of brain tissue killing it in the center of the tissue and leaving a margin around the death of semi living tissue. Strokes have different causes. Ischemic , lack of oxygen , or embolic, also lack of oxygen but caused by a small clot that flew into the brain artery and blocked blood flow. Tumors and foreign bodies can cause blockages as well.\nIf this blockage lasts more than about 15 minutes it it pretty certain that part of the brain tissue will die. Dead brain means loss of the nerves in that part of the brain.\nHow long does this blockage last ?\nDoes the part of the brain have some rapid alternative blood supply?\nWill the clot dissolve before it kills brain tissue and restores some blood supply. ?\nWhat happens to dead brain tissue ?\nA Reversible Ischemic neurological deficit (RIND, or TIA,). Has usually meant that neurological loss is temporary and has mostly recovered to normal within 24 hours. ( this may be old school speak ).\nA completed Stroke is a neurological deficit that lasts more than 24 hours. It may change and improve a bit but it leaves residual neurological loss .\nHemorrhagic stroke can be several things.\nThe dead tissue bleeds into itself or expands and hurts other tissue\nThe small brain artery actually bursts and blood into brain tissue that expands and puts pressure on normal brain tissue. This is often because of a brain aneurism. ( like a small defect in the Artery that forms a balloon in the vessel and it bursts )"}

{"_id": "8e2073a9", "question": "How long will it take an ischemic stroke to recover?", "answers": "An aneurism, called a stroke since olden days, when it was believed you were stricken by a supernatural deity, is a lack of blood getting to parts of the brain. “Ischaemic”, means lack of blood. Asking how long it takes to recover is totally dependent on how serious the aneurism is. Transient Ischaemic Attacks or TIA are relatively minor and effects last about 24 hours with no permanent damage, but aneurisms can also kill immediately. In between TIA and a killer attack are a whole range of aneurisms.\nFor anyone, who has a stroke, suitable pills will be prescribed and the patient may last as long as Kirk Douglas, who is about to turn 101 years old and who had an aneurism about 30 years ago."}

Due to the buildup of pressure in the skull, disrupting blood flow to the brain.\nI think there are studies on this, too, but I can’t look them up right now. I remember reading one that said CRS (Chronic Rhinosinusitis) does, in fact, raise the risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.

Your odds of surviving it are much better! The first one is a clot and the other is a bleed. So, the treat it first by locating it preferably as soon as they are aware of its existance. Clots can be a little dangerous. You don’t want it floating off into some place dangerous and getting stuck, causing damage. If they determine that this clot is one they can safely break down without causing you harm, they give you medicine to do so. If not, they will sometimes remove it surgically. The biggest danger is when the clot lodges in the heart, lungs or brain. Things can get scary then. Some hospitals have whole wings for dealing with that! They also often have two nurses per bed for the people with those issues and the ones with the hemorrhagics. They get even scarier. But, you have enough to deal with I bet.

{"_id": "a0b51883", "question": "What is the difference between an ischemic stroke and a hemorrhagic stroke?", "answers": "Stroke is defined as a specific area of neurological insufficiency due to a lesion in vascular system. Its onset is usually rapid and it may last for more than 24 hours. Patient may or may not survive during this episode. It presents as weakness of any area of body with or without disturbance of speech. It usually occurs after the age of 40 years. It is more common in males as compared to females. Its risk factors are non- modifiable which include age, gender, hereditary and previous history of stroke. Others are modifiable and include hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes, high blood cholesterol level and heart failure. Stroke is divided into two groups. One is hemorrhagic and other is ischemic stroke.\nIt occurs due to rupture of an artery. It has two types. One is intra-cerebral hemorrhage which occurs due to rupture of small arteries which are already weakened by hypertension. It can be fatal as compression of brain can occur. Second type is sub-arachnoid hemorrhage which develops due to rupture of major artery at the level of brain. This type of hemorrhage is characterized by sudden onset of headache, difficulty in movements of eyes, nausea and vomiting. History of patient who presents with stroke is important to determine the cause and progression of this disease.\nIschemic stroke occurs due to blockage of a major artery ultimately leading to decreased blood flow to the brain resulting in damage to brain cells which is called ‘cerebral infarction’. Arteries may be occluded due to thrombosis in intracranial or extra-cranial arteries or embolism from somewhere outside the brain especially heart. Once deprived of blood supply, brain tissues undergo sudden death within a few minutes. Damaged tissues are then filed up with fluid after some hours, which cause more damage and impair further blood flow\nDifference between Hemorrhagic\nStroke\nand\nIschemic\nStroke\n- ResearchPedia.Info"}

{"_id": "60ec48f5", "question": "Why would a decompressive craniectomy be necessary for an ischemic stroke?", "answers": "Mostly because the brain is housed in a rigid bony container.\nThe pressures inside that container can go up rapidly if say a tumor or blood starts to expand and take up space. This puts healthy brain tissue at risk because 1. above a certain pressure blood flow stops and 2. healthy brain is being pushed against the skull or squeezed through narrow openings.\nIn the case of stroke the following can happen\nThis is malignant MCA syndrome. There is a blockage in the middle cerebral artery which supplies blood to much of the cerebrum. The large dark swelling on the right side of the CT scan (the left side of the patient’s brain) is dead brain tissue. Irreversibly so. These dead cells swell and leak fluid. I think you can appreciate how this edema is pushing the entire brain to one side, with crowding and distortion of the part of the brain that isn’t already irreversibly injured.\nCraniectomy removes part of the skull, creating room for the dead brain tissue to swell. This minimizes damage to healthy brain. The decision to do this surgery is quite challenging - as you can imagine the patient has already suffered a devastating stroke, and outcomes from someone requiring this surgery are usually quite poor, particularly if they are older and have other medical problems."}

{"_id": "00460b29", "question": "Do ambulances and paramedics carry clot-busting drugs such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to treat people suffering ischemic strokes?", "answers": "Not knowing the full scope of practice for every service in the world, I can't definitively say yes or no, but I would say it is highly unlikely except in specialist cases.\nThe reason for this is that there are 2 causes of stroke. Ischemic stroke is a blocked artery that will be treated by a clot busting drug with good effect and positive outcomes. Hemorrhagic stroke is a burst artery causing issues because the blood is leaking out before reaching the affected tissue. Clot busting drugs prevent this bleed sealing itself, leading to the patient bleeding out, which is, needless to say, a particularly negative outcome.\nThe problem is that in the field, they are indistinguishable based on signs and symptoms. A CT scan is required to determine the cause of the stroke. So paramedics are somewhat loathe to go pumping clot busting drugs into stroke patients in the field, because for all intents and purposes you've got a 50:50 call on either fixing the problem or killing the patient, without even factoring in the other potential complications. So unless they are working on a dedicated stroke ambulance with a portable CT in the back, they are almost certainly not carrying clot busters for strokes."}

I still struggle with some things, but on the whole I’ve recovered remarkably well.\nYou don’t say what you mean by getting worse. It could be that the person is simply realizing that the deficits are real or that they are getting tired of all the therapy appointments, or that post-stroke pain (common after thalamic strokes) has set in.\nPost stroke pain hit as sensation started returning to my affected side, about two months post-stroke. One side is burning, tingling and numb — all at the same time — 24 hours per day, every day. I recently went to a clinic that specializes in neuropathic pain. That really helped. They understood what I was talking about and listed options. No other doctor had.\nI also have hemi-ataxia which causes clumsiness on one side of my body. That affects my balance. I’m still doing Physical Therapy exercises as well as Occupational Therapy exercises. I do a round of sessions with my PT and/or OT a few times each year as my condition changes.\nBut I’m walking, talking, going to the gym and typing. I feel fortunate!"}

Will this ever go away?", "answers": "I’m sorry about your stroke and resulting chronic pain. You can certainly work to overcome the chronic pain, but you have to open your mind and do something your medical doctor did not suggest. See a CBP chiropractor for evaluation and corrective treatment. You need to see for yourself, on XRAY why your brain’s energy has impeded flow. Doctors who told you no injury is present were WRONG. You had a stroke for crying out loud!!!! I suspect you have lost your normal cervical lordotic form (structure) which in turn causes all types of health problems including stroke. Why? Because structure dictates function. You can sit on a three legged chair, but the chair is unstable and you’d need to balance on three legs. The structure limits the function of the chair, just as your spinal column structure dictates the function of your body. This can be corrected non surgically and for far less money than a surgery. CBP chiropractic works to remodel abnormal structure and restore normal function. Your body is telling you, “I’m under pressure” pain is resulting in your arm. FIX IT!!! it’s possible. I work to help people fix this painful scenario every single day, little by little. No surgery, no medication, but instead exercise of core structure, adjustment of same structure followed by a traction protocol. Together that recipe will correct your condition over time. 3 months of focus and 3 visits per week and you will change your life and gain confidence in your future health. Good luck!"}

{"_id": "3b48a8fd", "question": "How is it determined if a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic?", "answers": "When a patient comes do the Emergency Room with an acute neurological deficit and the probable diagnosis is a stroke, the first exam to be performed is a CT scan to exclude intracranial haemorrhage, which would preclude thrombolysis; to look for any \"early\" signs of infarction; and to exclude other intracranial pathologies that may mimic a stroke, such as tumour.\nThe first signs of an ischemic stroke may be very subtle and include:\n1. A hyperdense segment of a vessel, most communly observed in the middle cerebral artery. It's the earliest sign visible in the CT.\n2. Loss of grey-white matter differentiation, and hypoattenuation of deep nuclei, as well as cortical hypodensity with associated parenchymal swelling with resultant gyral effacement. Visible in the first 1-3 hours.\n3. Progressive hypo-attenuation and swelling In the first week.\n4. And finally, after months, we can see an image of low density, with no mass effect, such as the following:\nOn the other hand, acute brain haemorrhage appears hyperdense (white) on CT scans, as we can see in the image below:\n\nThere are many kinds of intracranial haemorrhage and a long list of images you can get based in the artery affected by an ischemic stroke (all with different clinical onsets).

No tPA for me.\nI’ve heard that survivors of ischemic stroke who had hemi-paralysis arriving at Emergency, and promptly received tPA then walked out of the hospital a few hours later. Amazing! I couldn’t take a step without falling for weeks. I fell in ER and in ICU. In rehab, I finally understood — alcoholics and addicts in rehab need to accept that they are powerless over their substance. I had to accept that I was powerless over my left side.\nI was shocked to read (months later) that 40%–50% of hemorrhagic strokes are fatal within the first 30 days. The neurologist told my husband and daughter that if I survived the first night, I’d probably be ok. Thank goodness, I didn’t hear that! The neurologist said that blood is toxic to brain cells. The blood-brain barrier is why the brain is “grey matter”, not red. In my stroke, the blood flowed into one of the ventricles, so the damage to my grey matter was limited.\nI’ve read that hemorrhagic stroke is more common in younger people. In this context “young” means under 60. That made me smile — it has been quite a while since anyone said I was young. :)\nExercise almost every day. Don’t smoke.

{"_id": "24b60f14", "question": "Does the ischemic brain stroke lead to cerebral dementia (partial loss of reasoning)?", "answers": "That’s not an easy question to answer.\nIt would seem intuitive that, for a brain disorder such as stroke, clinical assessment should include the examination of memory, thinking, and mood. However, until quite recently, the focus has been on the physical manifestations of stroke, and neuropsychological aspects have received far too little attention. There is now mounting evidence that cognitive impairment after stroke is a significant contributor to disability, and its prevalence tends to increase sharply with advancing age. However, studies on the prevalence, course, and prognosis of poststroke cognitive disorders have produced wildly conflicting results. In fact, the symptoms of poststroke cognitive impairment are not well defined, and are misunderstood and misdiagnosed by many clinicians.\nThis post is quite long, because I'm not sure what you're really asking. It's divided into three main sections, to make it easier to find the information you want:\n(1) What categories of cognitive impairment can be caused by ischemic brain stroke?\nStroke can have a wide range of effects on brain function, from mild poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) to overt poststroke dementia (PSD). Our understanding of these effects is undergoing rapid change, This section discusses the current terminology used in the recent research literature, and how each category of impairment is defined.\n(2) Whether, when, and why will cognitive dysfunction (PSCI and/or PSD) occur after an ischemic stroke?\nDoes ischemic brain stroke always cause cognitive impairment? No. This section discusses the frequency with which each type of impairment is caused in stroke survivors, how soon after stroke the impairment is seen, and some of the factors affecting a given stroke survivor's likelihood of suffering long-term cognitive impairment.\n(3) What sorts of behavioral changes can be caused by poststroke cognitive impairment?\nBoth sections (1) and (2) might just be technobabble to the layman who's never encountered what stroke can do, other than the obvious physical difficulties such as a paralyzed arm. It occurred to me that you might really be wondering whether the strange behaviors of a loved one were actually caused by stroke, or by something else. This third section describes the more common, and some of the more unusual, behavioral changes that stroke can cause.\n(1) What categories of cognitive impairment can be caused by ischemic brain stroke?\nThe terminology surrounding poststroke cognitive impairment is changing, so let's start there, for clarity.\nThe term \"vascular cognitive impairment (VCI)\" has been proposed as an umbrella term to recognize the broad spectrum of cognitive and behavioral changes associated with vascular pathology. The most common causes of VCI are small-vessel disease, large-vessel disease, and strategic infarcts that may be either cortical or subcortical. VCI may also be the result of hypoperfusion, hemorrhage, and hereditary conditions (for example, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, CADASIL). All of these subtypes of VCI may appear poststroke. Even when poststroke dementia (PSD) and poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) are not purely vascular in origin, they can at least partly be regarded as categories of VCI.\nPoststroke dementia (PSD) is defined as any dementia occurring after stroke, including vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, other neurodegenerative dementias, or mixed dementia. (Note that vascular lesions often coexist with Alzheimer's disease pathology and other lesions, and the presence of multiple pathologies greatly increases the odds of dementia.) The concepts PSD and PSCI usually refer to conditions occurring after symptomatic strokes with corresponding ischemic findings on neuroradiological imaging. However, seemingly asymptomatic strokes – a common incidental finding in patients both with and without symptomatic strokes – add to the vascular burden of the brain and can affect cognitive function. Dementia can even be caused by non-focal neurological changes found in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA).\nPoststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is a common and under-recognised problem that may eventually lead to dementia (PSD). Two major issues hampering PSCI research include the lack of a clear-cut definition and a lack of highly specific and sensitive screening tools that accurately predict PSCI. PCSI is currently defined as failure in any cognitive domain after stroke, including attention and processing speed (sustained attention, divided attention, selective attention, information processing speed); frontal-executive function (planning, decision making, working memory, responding to feedback/error correction, novel situations, overriding habits, mental flexibility, judgment); learning and memory (immediate memory, recent memory -- including free recall, cued recall -- and recognition memory); language (naming, expressive, grammar and syntax, receptive); visuoconstructional-perceptual ability (construction, visual perception, and reasoning); praxis-gnosis-body schema (praxis, gnosis, right/left orientation, calculation ability, body schema, facial recognition); and/or social cognition (recognition of emotions and social cues, appropriate social inhibitions, theory of mind, empathy.)\nHowever, studies on the prevalence and progression of PSCI vary wildly as to the number of domains that must be impaired, the number of tests per domain, how domains are defined, and specific cut-offs used to define impairment. Early definitions of PSCI were based on the concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), primarily framed as a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. (Note that there are several different types of MCI; and two-thirds of MCI patients will not progress to Alzheimer's.) The definition of MCI (and, accordingly, earlier definitions of PSCI) often requires intact basic activities of daily living (ADLs). However, stroke patients often have substantial physical impairments that interfere with ADLs, independent of cognitive function. Therefore, it has recently been recommended that requirements for intact ADLs should be specific to instrumental ADLs (IADLs) that are associated with cognition (e.g. managing money). This is consistent with the recent DSM-5 criteria which emphasize impairment in IADLs as a distinguishing factor between major and minor neurocognitive disorders. The new criteria also do not require memory impairment as a core symptom of PSCI or PSD. In stroke, it may be possible to have severely disabling cognitive problems but still retain memory. This latter change will be a major leap forward in studying and understanding poststroke cognitive function.\nEven without progression to PSD, milder levels of cognitive impairment may result in reduced participation in rehabilitation and poor adherence to treatment. PSCI predicts suboptimal recovery in activities of daily living, which in turn results in a lower quality of life (and a heavier burden on caregivers.)\n(2) Whether, when, and why will cognitive dysfunction (PSCI and/or PSD) occur after an ischemic stroke?\nThe studies that have been conducted on neuropsychological aspects of stroke have produced conflicting results. Various studies have concluded that some stroke survivors may show no cognitive deficits, whereas the cognitive function of others may decline, initially decline and then improve, decline and then remain stable, and/or may progress to dementia over time. How many stroke survivors follow each of these poststroke profiles is unknown, since different studies reached widely different conclusions. The differences in prevalence and progression reported by different researchers may be related to differences in the diagnostic criteria (see above), the cognitive tests used, the timing of the testing (i.e., how soon after stroke the first cognitive testing is done, and how frequently follow-up testing is done, and long the follow-up period is), history of previous stroke, stroke location, the volume of the lesion, the presence of large‐ and small‐vessel disease, population sample (clinical- versus population-based, ages, gender, etc), inclusion/exclusion criteria for those patients to be tested, ethnicity, and the presence of neurodegenerative pathology. In some patients, the initial poststroke cognitive state may reflect prestroke cognitive decline or delirium. On top of all of this, some researchers have concluded that cognitive outcome following a stroke is dependent on sociodemographic, health, and stroke‐related risk factors, not just on the properties of the stroke itself and the overall pre-stroke vascular burden of the brain.\nFor example, population or sampling characteristics, such as study setting (hospital or community), inclusion of patients with recurrent stroke, or inclusion of patients with pre-stroke cognitive impairment or dementia, can lead to variation in estimates of PSCI or PSD prevalence. Exclusion of patients who have difficulty undergoing cognitive testing (e.g., have severe aphasia due to the stroke) may be unavoidable, but can also effect prevalence estimates. Some publications state that up to 78% of patients show some cognitive deficits within 1 month after the stroke. However, delirium is quite common in the days and weeks immediately following a stroke. (Studies have reported an incidence of delirium as high as 48% in the acute phase of stroke.) Delirium, which has a rapid onset, is a serious disturbance in mental abilities that results in confused thinking and reduced awareness of the environment. Because symptoms of delirium and dementia can be similar, diagnosis of one in the presence of the other can be tricky. Ergo, erroneously high figures for the prevalence of cognitive deficits may be produced by studies that assess cognitive function within a month or two of the stroke; and those that went on to conduct additional assessments months later might have reported initial cognitive decline followed by some degree of recovery, whereas what was actually being observed was the resolution of the delirium. Most of the higher quality studies did not attempt to establish baseline poststroke cognition until three months after the stroke.\nOne of the biggest flaws is the method(s) used to evaluate cognitive function. Even though there is an enormous amount of evidence that domain-specific cognitive tools are essential to capture the impact of PSCI and/or PSD, the vast majority of studies have relied exclusively on short, simple screening tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and/or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). There are far too many factors that can affect the outcome of these simplistic tests for either one to be used to diagnose cognitive impairment, let alone estimate its severity. Both tests were initially developed to quickly screen for the possibility of Alzheimer's in outpatient settings rather than to identify cognitive defects in stroke patients. These tests have low sensitivity for the most commonly affected cognitive domains after stroke, such as executive function and processing speed. Moreover, PSCI is usually accompanied by additional cognitive deficits, such as aphasia/language dysfunction, vision loss, apraxia and spatial neglect, for which the tests are not sensitive and may greatly underestimate cases of cognitive impairment involving specific neurological deficits (e.g., aphasia). A 2019 systematic review on the cognitive screening tools used in the diagnosis of PSCI concluded that studies on PSCI have relied almost exclusively on nonspecific cognitive screening tools; that it is very well established that they are hopelessly inadequate for this purpose; and that a comprehensive standardized battery of neuropsychological tests is needed to fully capture the effects of stroke on cognitive function; even multidomain screening tools such as the new Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) are superior for the diagnosis of PSD and PSCI.\nKeeping all of this in mind, studies have generally concluded that, six months poststroke, roughly half of stroke survivors have neurocognitive disorders, two-thirds of whom have PSCI, and one-third of whom have PSD. Due to the inadequacies of the assessment tools that have been used, the prevalence of PSCI and PSD are undoubtedly higher. A study involving a population free from pre-stroke cognitive decline found that 57% suffered from cognitive impairment one year after stroke, only one third of whom developed a purely vascular cognitive disease. Poststroke cognitive impairment in the remainder was complex with a high coexistence of vascular and degenerative changes.\nTemporal aspects of cognitive impairment in patients (e.g., whether patients remain stable, improve, or decline) have often been ignored. Most of the studies that attempted to address this essential feature used screening tools such as the MMSE to judge the severity of cognitive problems. As noted above, the MMSE was never intended for this purpose and is hopelessly inadequate for it, despite its widespread use. Moreover, many studies have been cross-sectional, which are inadequate for addressing temporal aspects -- only longitudinal studies yield accurate information on progression. Finally, as more is learned about poststroke cognitive function, it becomes clear that a relatively long follow-up is needed to fully capture the impact of a stroke on the brain. Acute stroke may cause both a sudden cognitive decline and accelerated cognitive decline that is persistent over time. Very recent studies have concluded that cognitive function can decline in a delayed fashion, suggesting an indirect, more gradual onset rather than (or in addition to) a direct, sudden onset; any study with a short follow-up time period is unlikely to capture the full extent of a delayed decline. Delayed decline has been reported in approximately one‐third of patients. Several reasonably reliable studies with follow-up periods as long as five years have concluded that the delayed development of incident dementia remains up to 9 times greater than among an age-matched population for ≥5 years after stroke. Decline in cognitive function, however, is not inevitable; ~2.7 to 20% stroke survivors with PSCI but no dementia may eventually recover, depending on age and provided there is no recurrent stroke.\nStudies that combined sophisticated imaging techniques with extensive neuropsychological tests have produced the most reliable information, although these are few and far between. One excellent, and very interesting, example is a 2018 paper on a prospective, hospital-based study used 3-T MRI and a comprehensive standardized battery of neuropsychological tests 6 months after the index event to define the neuroimaging determinants of poststroke cognitive performance and their relative contributions. Data were available for 356 patients, 326 [91.6%] of whom had experienced an ischemic stroke.\nHalf of the patients were found to have cognitive impairment six months poststroke.\nOf the many different MRI markers, the presence of a lesion within a small \"strategic\" site (i.e., the right corticospinal tract, left antero-middle thalamus, left arcuate fasciculus, left middle frontal gyrus, or left postero-inferior cerebellum) was the main determinant of poststroke cognitive performance and accounted for 22.5% of the observed variance in the global cognitive score.\nStroke volume, total medial temporal lobe atrophy, and brain tissue volume were independent but weaker determinants, together accounting for an additional 11.8% variance in the global cognitive score.\nThe total stroke volume accounted for only a small proportion (4.3%) of the variability in cognitive performance.\nThe white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden, presence of microbleeds, and dilated perivascular spaces were not independent determinants.\nThis study emphasizes the fact that, regardless of their volume, lesions in strategic areas have a key role in the occurrence of poststroke neurocognitive disorders. Strategic strokes accounted for poor cognitive performance in patients with both a small stroke volume and no cerebral atrophy. Routine assessment of important cognitive domains is an essential part of the clinical workup. When clinical exam and neuroimaging show that there is involvement of strategic locations of the brain, assessment of the function for major brain networks should also be made. These include the domains for language, attention and spatial orientation, object recognition, memory, and motor planning and control.\nAlso, atrophy has been one of the most controversial MRI markers for poststroke cognitive performance. Data from this 2018 study indicate that cerebral atrophy is associated with cognitive impairments. The researchers hypothesize that post-ischemia neurodegeneration in the subcortical region is probably one of the main contributors. Their results also emphasize the role of medial temporal lobe atrophy in poststroke neurocognitive disorders, independently from a potentially associated Alzheimer's disease. Medial temporal lobe atrophy may be related to delayed ischemic injury in hippocampal areas associated with selective vulnerability in a pure vascular process.\nUnfortunately, the cross-sectional design of this 2018 study made it impossible to investigate the relationship between MRI markers and long-term cognitive performance.\nThe increasing use of MRI is influencing, and may even exaggerate, the estimate of the vascular burden behind cognitive impairment, because vascular changes are more apparent than degenerative ones in neuroradiology. On the other hand, depending on their location, vascular lesions may be more influential than they appear to be, disrupting interconnections between several distal regions. This applies, for example, to lesions in the basal ganglia and to the deep white matter, which damage the frontal-subcortical network and associate with executive dysfunction. The thalamus is another example of a strategic infarct location that may also cause amnestic dysfunction, in addition to executive defects.\n(3) What sorts of behavioral changes can be caused by poststroke cognitive impairment?\nI tripped across an interesting paper, Stroke and Behavior by Victor W Mark, describing the more common, and some of the more unusual, behavioral changes that stroke can cause. It's intended for the clinician, but it occurred to me that the answer I've written above might just be gibberish to the layman who's never encountered what stroke can do, other than the obvious physical difficulties, such as a paralyzed arm ... and that you might be asking your question because you wonder whether the changes you're observing in your loved one were actually caused by stroke, or something else. I'll briefly summarized what the paper had to say, but if you want to learn more, I'd suggest you contact Dr Mark to ask for a copy of the full publication: Stroke\nand Behavior | Request PDF\nDoctors and researchers primarily assess the impact of stroke in the controlled environment of the clinic or laboratory, using tests and materials that are assumed to simulate daily living activities, but that actually fail to represent the demands of the \"real world\" on the stroke survivor. Notably, performance is generally evaluated in response to the doctor’s prompting (“on command”), whereas much of real life occurs spontaneously, without prompting, and in a much more familiar environment. These differences can lead to marked differences in behavior between laboratory and home settings that you'll rarely find discussed in the research literature.\nAlso note that behavioral studies of stroke primarily assess its acute effects, i.e., changes that take place shortly after the stroke. However, the severity as well as the quality of the behavioral effects of stroke may change considerably over the long run.\nIn some languages -- for example, Chinese -- tone production during speech is crucial for interpreting individual word meanings in those languages. In addition, stroke survivors who had received less formal education are believed to develop more severe symptoms in many cognitive domains. The paper warns that many researchers have studied adults from industrialized societies who were formally well-educated and whose native language was nontonal (i.e., a language in which a word’s meaning is not affected by its intonation). The behavioral changes after stroke among patients who fall outside of these characteristics -- for example, patients from rural China -- are less well understood. On top of that, stroke survivors with severely impaired speech are usually excluded from studies on the impact of stroke on behavior, even those that involve nonverbal cognition tests. Hence, there is also little understanding of the impact of stroke on nonverbal communication in stroke patients.\nThe following are some of the types of cognitive symptoms that can be caused by stroke. The paper also sometimes provides information on how such symptoms are diagnosed in stroke survivors, and some limited information on rehabilitation.\nExecutive functions: Dr Mark says, \"This very broad category refers to processes that regulate other functions, in the same way that a company’s executive controls subsidiary operations (eg, marketing, hiring, promotion, production, support services) without directly being involved with them.\" Generally speaking, executive functions involve planning (which requires abstraction), initiation, staying mindful of task objectives (working memory), prioritizing goals, sequencing activities for specific goals, and inhibiting attention to irrelevant stimuli (minimizing distraction).\nDisturbances to executive function after stroke can cause lack of spontaneity, distractibility, performing multistep operations in the wrong order, failure to inhibit behaviors that are inappropriate to a situation (eg, laughing while attending a funeral), or performing actions repeatedly for a goal or in response to stimulation, but needlessly (\"perseveration\"). In “recurrent perseveration”, a subtype of perseveration that is common in aphasia, patients uncritically repeat a response that they had provided to a previous question, but now, when given a new question, is inappropriate.\nThe presence of executive dysfunction after a stroke is thought to predict limited functional recovery, and to interfere with the patient's ability to respond to rehabilitation efforts. Apparently, executive dysfunction after acute stroke is very common, with figures as high as 50% to 75% having been reported. However, it is very difficult to assess executive dysfunction, because the tests often involve lengthy, laborious procedures and/or require patients to understand complex instructions or give spoken responses. The requirements for understanding and responding to complex instructions often end up with a large number of aphasic patients being excluded from executive function studies.\nLanguage: Aphasia, which is one of the most common cognitive disturbances caused by stroke, is difficulty in communicating using language. Language is the ability to encode ideas into words or symbols for communication to someone else, and includes speaking, understanding the speech of others, reading, writing, gesturing (including sign language), and using numbers. Aphasia must be distinguished from speech dysarthria, mutism, aphonia (inability to vocalize), and hearing loss, which affect the physical ability to produce or hear speech, but do not selectively affect the symbolic aspects of speech. For example, stroke survivors with dysarthria experience “slurred” or “mumbled” speech due to limited lip, tongue and jaw movement; and there may be changes in pitch, or vocal quality (e.g., hoarseness or breathiness.)\nAphasia occurs in about one-third of acute stroke patients and predicts worse survival than in nonaphasic stroke patients. By six months after stroke onset, aphasia may improve in more than one-half of patients and completely resolve in about 38%.\nAphasia primarily results from left hemisphere injury (whether the patient is left- or right-handed.) However, aphasic disorders may rarely be caused by right hemisphere stroke, which is called crossed aphasia. The impairments that follow right hemisphere stroke are often subtle and difficult to recognize, including the patient having impaired interpretation of the social signals in discourse (such as failing to notice when another individual wants to end discussion), misunderstanding ambiguity, and producing meandering topics during speech expression.\nWhile aphasia often becomes less severe, the character of the aphasic disturbance may itself change during the patient's recovery. For example, global aphasia (typified by markedly impoverished speech comprehension and production) may change to Wernicke aphasia (fluent but nonsensical speech and poor comprehension); Broca aphasia (good comprehension, poor speech production) may resolve to anomic aphasia (good comprehension and fluency, but with word-finding difficulties). While nonfluent aphasia often gives way to fluent aphasia, fluent aphasia does not change to nonfluent aphasia.\nStroke may also affect the use and/or interpretation of speech intonation, called aprosodia. \"Affective aprosodia\" is the disturbed interpretation or expression of emotional tone in speech; and \"linguistic aprosodia\" is the disturbance of nonemotional tone, for example, the conveyance of emphasis (“!”) or interrogation (“?”) in a sentence. In such disorders, the problem is not with word selection or sentence construction, but rather with determining the speaker’s social perspective (Is he angry?) or need for information (Is she asking a question?). Aprosodia is not associated with damage to any particular brain area or side. Testing is complicated by the need to rely on contrived situations that may not represent ordinary conditions for communications.\nApraxia of speech can also be caused by stroke. This disturbance involves the inconsistent production of speech sounds (particularly consonants, depending on whether they are initial vs later in a word), and is considered a deficit of planning speech movements. This inconsistency thus differs from speech dysarthria. Associated difficulties include slowed rate of speech and abnormal rhythm and intonation. The disorder often is found with concurrent nonfluent aphasia. Reliable diagnosis and treatment have not been well-developed; its incidence in stroke is undetermined.\nAttention: Attention is the process of enhancing detection of a signal or stimulus from the environment, to the point where it can then be acted upon. Inattention caused by stroke may either be lateralized or nonlateralized with respect to the environment.\nThe lateralized deficit is termed \"unilateral spatial neglect\" (neglect for short) and is a topic of intense research. This interest may be in part because the disorder, like aphasia, is easily noticed. For example, the patient with acute severe neglect consistently gazes toward the side of hemispheric damage (Vulpian sign), in the absence of oculomotor palsy. When patients with acute neglect combined with hemiplegia (total or partial paralysis of one side of the body) are asked to clap their hands, often they wave only the relatively good hand toward the body midline repeatedly without accommodating the lack of mobility in the other hand. This \"one-handed clapping\" is known as the Eastchester clapping sign. There is a general decrease in the initiation of action, and in exploring toward the contralateral side of space. Such problems can hamper locomotion (including car or wheelchair navigation), eating, grooming, reading, and protecting the paralyzed limbs from injury during transfers between bed and chair. Unilateral spatial neglect may even occur in one’s imagination, for example, when describing a familiar space that is out of view. Patients are often unaware of their attentional deficit and/or associated unilateral limb paralysis.\nNeglect is almost invariably opposite the side of hemispheric injury rather than on the same side of injury. It is about equally common after left versus right hemisphere damage, but right unilateral neglect is typically milder and resolves more rapidly.\nNeglect initially occurs in about one-half of all stroke survivors, but its incidence quickly diminishes, so that by about three months after the stroke, only ~30% of survivors still have neglect. However, standard neglect assessments may underestimate its prevalence. For example, standard pen-and-paper assessments may not detect neglect, whereas requesting the patient to perform everyday activities such as self-grooming or finding one’s way in a wheelchair may produce evidence of neglect.\nPatients with neglect are also susceptible to nonlateralized deficits of attention, including difficulty sustaining attention (or vigilance) over several minutes, and slowed response times. The finding that acute neglect may be a biomarker for chronic disability or impaired nonlateralized visuospatial processing, even in the absence of demonstrable neglect suggests that it may not be neglect per se that is most disabling, but rather an associated general inattention disorder. Unfortunately, there has been little investigation into nonspatial attentional deficits, their effect on daily living activities, epidemiology, and natural history, let alone controlled trials of rehabilitation.\nMemory: When referring to memory here, we are not including the “working memory” that was indicated to be an executive function (i.e., remaining constantly mindful of a fact or task requirement), but rather the process of either learning information or reconstituting it whenever necessary without staying mindful of it (episodic memory). Routine screening tests such as the MMSE ask the patient to repeat 3 unrelated words (e.g., apple, penny, table) immediately, to ensure the patient heard and understood the words, and then to recall those words after a few minutes’ delay (typically 5 minutes) as a brief clinical assessment of memory. Most Alzheimer's patients are unable to recall the words, even in the earliest stages of the disease. Impaired memory may occur in only ~11% of acute stroke patients -- and yet, until very recently, stroke survivors were not considered to have dementia unless they had impaired memory. This requirement was based on the hallmark symptom of Alzheimer's disease, not on any understanding of the severity of the impact stroke can have on the human brain. Moreover, to this day, the vast majority of the research literature on the prevalence and severity of cognitive dysfunction caused by stroke relies on brief screening tools such as the MMSE. Note, too, that unlike most cognitive disorders, verbal memory may continually worsen over the years after a stroke, relative to healthy individuals of the same age.\nEmotion: Stroke can provoke a wide variety of emotional changes which tend to follow a sequence rather than occurring all at once.\nInitial changes may include the “catastrophic reaction” and pseudobulbar affect. Catastrophic reaction refers to short-term marked irritability, anger, anxiety, or sadness when prompted to perform a task within the first few days of stroke onset. For example, patients with acute fluent aphasia with poor speech comprehension (Wernicke aphasia) may display marked agitation. After recovery from the aphasia, patients have reported that they had felt terrified, yet they believed that they could comprehend speech ordinarily, despite clinical observations to the contrary. Pseudobulbar affect is disinhibited crying or laughter that does not match the patient’s mood. The condition has a large number of synonyms, including emotionalism, emotional incontinence, pathologic affect, pathologic laughter and crying, and pseudobulbar palsy. Pseudobulbar affect has not been studied comprehensively. Its prevalence after stroke has been reported to range from 18% to 58%. The condition can be readily misdiagnosed as depression, with which it may co-occur. Stress can aggravate the pathologic display of affect.\nTrue depression emerges a few weeks after stroke onset. In stroke survivors, depression comprises a combination of sad mood, lack of initiative, steady state rather than cyclic emotional changes, lowered self-esteem, and feelings of guilt, particularly after patients have interacted with the complex world outside of the intensive care unit. depression is exceedingly common, ranging from 40% to 60% of patients, depending on the sample. The relationship between stroke and depression is bidirectional: depression itself is a risk factor for subsequent stroke, including fatal stroke, for unclear reasons. depression carries with it an increased risk of suicidal ideation, particularly in the first 2 years. Depression is also a biomarker for general cognitive impairment147,148 and impaired activities of daily living. Fortunately, conventional antidepressant medications are efficacious for poststroke depression. Improvement in depression is associated with improved self-care skills.\nPoststroke fatigue, which can co-occur with other poststroke conditions such as depression, also develops relatively late after stroke onset. In stroke survivors, \"fatigue\" refers to declining cognitive ability that is associated with the feeling of physical or mental strain, which can disrupt even simple routine activities. Poststroke fatigue may be found in the absence of pronounced neurologic deficits and is associated with failure to return to employment. It tends to be a chronic disorder. It has a reported prevalence ranging from 23% to 75%.\nInformal observations noted that the attitude of the stroke survivor toward the paralyzed arm may be affected. For example, patients with right hemiplegia and global (or severe) aphasia may reach over with the left hand and repeatedly mobilize the limp arm in the first few hours after stroke onset. In contrast, patients with left hemiplegia after stroke are more apt to demonstrate marked hatred for the arm, a condition that is called misoplegia.\nApathy refers to the combination of lack of goal-directed behaviors and diminished interest and concern. The incidence of poststroke apathy is 20% to 25%. The condition does not occur invariably with depression, but it does place patients at high risk for depression and suicidal ideation. Apathy has not been investigated very thoroughly in stroke patients.\nDiminished empathy may also follow stroke. Empathy refers to the ability to adopt the perspective of another individual with concern for that person’s goals. The study of empathy is a newly emerging focus in poststroke behavioral changes. According to a recent study, about one-half of the caregivers of patients recovering from right hemisphere stroke regarded the patients’ loss of empathy as one of their greatest stressors. As discussed under \"language\" above, right hemisphere stroke can make it difficult for a stroke survivor to understand sarcasm, which is one aspect of reduced empathy.\nMovement: The behavioral regulation of movement, particularly limb movement, can be significantly affected by stroke. As noted above, patients may exhibit unilateral motor neglect; however, another cause is learned nonuse. The difference between the two is that the former is considered to be based on a form of inattention, whereas the latter is thought to emerge from the combination of the inability of the partially paralyzed limb to perform routine self-care activities and the simultaneous compensation for such activities by the opposite, better functioning arm. Thus, learned nonuse is behaviorally conditioned by the circumstances of chronic hemiparesis (slight paralysis or weakness on one side of the body), leading to the persisting inhibition of spontaneous limb use for everyday activities.\nMotor neglect and learned nonuse of hemiparesis can both be improved with verbal prompting. However, the inverse relationship can also occur, i.e., movement can be inhibited after prompting. The difference depends on the extent of attention paid by the patient. For example, in the Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome (aka anterior opercular syndrome), stroke survivors may be unable to perform movements of the mouth upon command, yet show normal movements in a more familiar context (which demands less attention), such as when presented food or in response to an emotional stimulus. A limb version of such automatic-voluntary dissociation has been proposed, termed exo-evoked akinesia, but has seldom been reported clinically. Functional movement disorder (aka conversion disorder or psychogenic neurologic disorder) is a different kind of exo-evoked akinesia that manifests as a movement failure when the patient attends to the affected limb or is commanded to move it, but improves with distraction.\nIdeomotor apraxia (or apraxia for short) is the failure to competently generate the movements that are specific to tool use or gestures, despite (a) having sufficient movement capability to perform nonspecific movements and (b) understanding the task requirements. The term is applied when the stroke survivor is unable to recreate movements specific to learned activities, rather than reflecting part of a more general memory disorder. Ideomotor apraxia is most often reported with respect to upper extremity function, less so for oral movements (eg, soda straw use or blowing out a match), and even less for leg use (eg, kicking a ball, stamping out a cigarette). Roughly 6-7% of stroke survivors exhibit apraxia. Apraxia is important to stroke care because it is a biomarker for impaired functional recovery.\nAlien hand syndrome is a mostly unilateral disorder that involves seemingly purposeful activities by one hand without the patient’s consciously intending them, as if an alternate personality were guiding them. Although various subtypes have been described, the two most often reported are frontal alien hand and callosal alien hand, named for the brain regions that are characteristically affected. Frontal alien hand involves the disinhibited grabbing of objects that are within reaching distance. Often it is then hard for the patient to release the object. Callosal alien hand involves one hand obstructing, repeating, or undoing the actions of the other hand that is under voluntary control. For example, a callosal alien hand may counteract blouse unbuttoning by the other hand. Alien hand in either form may be frustrating, humiliating, or even dangerous, such as when grasping a hot object or driving a car. Despite numerous case reports, the epidemiology of alien hand has rarely been studied because it is rare, accounting for less than 1% of stroke patients in one series.\nSensory processing: Agnosias, in which a given sensory system is functioning normally but the brain misinterprets the signals from the system, are not unusual after stroke, but are not studied as much as the disorders described above, for several reasons. For example, because these disorders mostly arise from damage to posterior parts of the cerebrum, they often occur little or no effect on motor control and therefore are less likely to warrant inpatient rehabilitation. In addition, it is not unusual for patients with these disturbances to be unaware of these problems (the condition of anosognosia). [Speaking from my experience with agnosias in Alzheimer's patients, the caregiver is typically unaware of the problems, as well, and cannot begin to understand why the patient is behaving in a given way. In Alzheimer's, agnosias come and go, which further confuses efforts to figure out what is going on.]\nVisual agnosias may be chronic in 20% of stroke survivors. Those with loss of visual awareness -- at least for stationary objects -- to one side may initially be unaware of this loss. If they lack pronounced cognitive disorders, they can often readily discover their visual field limitation through interacting with the environment or through clinical education, and may learn to compensate for visual loss by increasing their head or eye movements to one side. However, a large percentage exhibit highly disorganized visual exploration, even in their preserved visual field for unclear reasons, and are vulnerable to accidents at busy traffic intersections or in other cluttered environments. Simple coaching and practice or formal oculomotor training may help to minimize this problem.\nA rare poststroke symptom of visual agnosia is the inability to recognize objects despite being capable of making elementary judgments about their properties, e.g., size and shape. Similarly, patients with auditory agnosia can point to sounds and describe some of their properties (eg, “clicking” when listening to a thumb moving along a pocket comb) without being able to specify the object responsible. A similar disturbance attends the rarely reported instance of tactile agnosia.\nA peculiar but little studied disorder involves the difficulty that stroke patients may have with connecting familiar percepts or concepts to each other. In particular, stroke survivors, particularly those with aphasia, were unable to color in line drawings of familiar objects with the expected colors (eg, banana / yellow). Instead, they significantly often chose unexpected colors, even though color blindness was excluded. This, accordingly, is termed color association disorder. A right hemisphere stroke patient without aphasia, however, used just a couple of colors in a line drawing of multiple familiar objects in a single plausible outdoor scene.\nAlthough such a disorder would seem to have little clinical relevance, the researchers noted that aphasic patients may also be prone to other abnormalities of percept matching, namely inability to match sounds that they heard to the most likely object in a picture array (eg, meow / cat). They also could not properly simulate object use when they were shown objects (eg, swing the arm when shown a hammer). The latter is a standard assessment of apraxia. The real-life implications of such difficulties when measured under laboratory conditions is not yet clear, but suggest a fundamental difficulty with abstraction.\nHallucinations, although rare, can also follow stroke. Typically, the hallucinations are of the visual kind, i.e., seeing something that isn't there. The stroke patient may see simple geometric shapes or complex objects, or have uncontrollable reexperiencing of objects that had just been viewed (palinopsia, or visual perseveration).\nStill other visual disturbances for which the clinician should be aware include alexia (the inability to interpret writing or print despite being able to see it), achromatopsia (loss of color vision from brain injury), and prosopagnosia (difficulty recognizing familiar faces). The auditory analog of prosopagnosia -- i.e., the impaired ability to recognize familiar voices -- is termed phonagnosia and has been reported in stroke, but rarely studied.\nFor more reading:\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/328287207_Neuroimaging_Determinants_of_Poststroke_Cognitive_Performance_The_GRECogVASC_Study\nto request a copy of the full paper\nPuy L, Barbay M, Roussel M, Canaple S, Lamy C, Arnoux A, Leclercq C, Mas JL, Tasseel-Ponche S, Constans JM, Godefroy O.

{"_id": "b43d9fa6", "question": "Are strokes related to ischemic heart disease?", "answers": "Strokes are mostly due to atherosclerosis. Coronary heart disease is due mostly to the same thing. Atherosclerosis is a disease that is multifocal ( touches many arteries at the same time) and can touch any artery in the body.\nNow to be succinct, there are other causes for these ischemic accidents besides atherosclerosis e.g. hereditary clotting problem, vasculitis…etc. But the principle stays the same, if it can affect a coronary artery or block it, it can affect too a cerebral artery.\nWhen plaque builds up, the artery’s wall becomes fragile. Now you need to know the the inner layer of a vessel, called endothelium, does not trigger a thrombus formation. The rupture of a plaque exposes the external layers of the wall of an artery to blood, clotting happens, as there is many chemicals that triggers it ( the same happens when you get a wound) and closes the artery further. All colors of the spectrum can be observed, from a completely and acutely blocked artery giving rise to an acute coronary syndrome to a relatively tolerated partial block to an extent, patient is happy when resting and in pain when making effort described as a stable angina.\nTo conclude, yes!! Strokes and ischemic heart disease are related to the extent that they are a manifestation of the same disease affecting arteries essentially, which is frequently atherosclerosis."}
{"_id": "0b8b9ec1", "question": "Can \"silent strokes\" only be of the ischemic type of stroke (thrombus), or also hemorrhagic (cracked blood vessel)?", "answers": "By nature hemorrhagic strokes are silent. Most people who would have them? If they goto bed due to the headache it produces, are dead by morning.\nThere are small hemorrhagic strokes that a patient lives, but outcomes for hemorrhagic strokes are dimmer. Not only because of blood loss, but blood contacting brain tissue is extremely toxic. It causes an inflammation process that the body tries to separate itself from the brain, and all that was bypassed. They have poorer outcomes because how much that inflammation kills itself.\nIschemic strokes the person usually survives to show/tell they even had a “silent stroke”.\nThe term used for “silent strokes” for ischemic strokes is often called Lacunar strokes, that often occur in the middle brain areas (thalamic strokes, for example). They can be many too (i.e., multiform) in a person. They’re “silent” because people mistake them for having a bad headache; or their eyes are tired; because of both they’re walking like a drunk. Usually hemorrhagic strokes will have much more devastating signs, caused by blood “on the brain” itself."}

This involves tight control of blood pressure, antiplatelet agents, control of blood sugar and control of cholesterol, among other things.

You feel some numbness/weakness in half of your body, potentially have dizzy spells, lose some ability possibly like speech, etc but things resolve relatively quickly, say within 24 hours or maybe a few days. Have a work colleague who had a minor stroke one night, everything was back to \"normal\" the next morning.\nA typical stroke on the other hand ranging from (big to major to massive, etc) depending on the damage, can lead to hemiplegia (half-body paralysis), aphasia (loss of speech) or other life-changing injuries that can take months to resolve.

That would cause severe brain damage within a few minutes, if blood flow were not restored. The brain depends on the circulation for a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen.\nIn the case of stroke or TIA, blood flow is reduced, but only to a part of the brain, not the brain as a whole. It need not necessarily be reduced to zero to cause symptoms.\nNormally, cerebral blood flow is maintained at ~50 mL per 100 g of brain tissue per minute. A fall to 30 ml/100g/min would very likely cause symptoms.\nThe body puts a premium on maintaining a constant blood flow to the brain via the process called autoregulation.

There is also evidence that blood supply has been reduced, and will stay reduced unless something is done about it."}

It describes generally what happens in an acute stroke, but not the things one can do to prevent stroke — and to prevent a second stroke if you’re fortunate enough to survive an initial stroke.\nThe biggest risk factor for stroke is having had a prior stroke. I learned that from the EMT’S who were transporting me from the Neuro ICU to the acute care rehabilitation hospital after I had a hemorrhagic stroke. I was shocked!\nMy neurologist found a second, unburst aneurysm in my internal carotid artery. He said that my initial brain hemorrhage may have saved my life because it caused the second, extremely dangerous aneurysm to be found. He “coiled” the aneurysm in an intracerebral endovascular procedure. I was kept overnight in the neuro ICU afterward, then released without a ticking time bomb in my brain!\nIf you’re worried about stroke:\nQuit smoking everything if you smoke anything.\nQuit drinking. Even one small alcoholic drink per day increases your risk of stroke.\nMonitor your blood pressure at home, and if it is consistently over 120/80, take your BP readings to your doctor to discuss them.\nEat according to the DASH Diet.[1] Clinical studies have shown it to reduce overall blood pressure.\nTake BP medications if your doctor prescribes them.\nI wish I’d known I had high BP prior to my stroke. I felt fine. I was working hard and didn’t prioritize my doctor’s annual visit. I hadn’t even been to the doctor for more than two years when I had the stroke. My neurologist thinks that high blood pressure is what caused the bleed in my brain that left me disabled enough to be approved for Social Security Disability to approve my application within months of my initial application, without rejecting it or even asking many questions beyond a review of my medical records.\nI am fortunate to have survived, but I will live with disabling deficits for the rest of my life.\nFootnotes\n[1] How to make the DASH diet work for you"}

Or would these instances require hospitalization?", "answers": "If I read your question correctly, I’d say that if one had brain damage from a heat stroke and didn’t know it, it would be because the damage was so severe that the individual didn’t know much of anything.\nIf one is searching for an explanation for minor brain-related symptoms, there are multiple diagnostic possibilities that are probably more likely than an unrecognized heat stroke that happened without any of the clinical features of hyperthermia."}

{"_id": "5ce5e984", "question": "What are the best clinics or hospitals known for stem cell therapy treatment for an ischemic brain stroke?", "answers": "An ischemic stroke is caused when the blood vessels, carrying fresh blood to the brain get obstructed or blocked with a blood clot. As the blood vessels narrow over time due to cholesterol build-up, it may rupture. Cell treatment for\nstroke\nis a safe and simple procedure done at the Neurogen hospital. Well known neurosurgeons and the dedicated team, offer their services to uplifts the independent lifestyle in their patients."}
{"_id": "334f0835", "question": "What is the difference between a stroke and a transient ischemic attack?", "answers": "A transient ischemic attack has the same origins as that of an ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke. In an ischemic stroke, a clot blocks the blood supply to part of your brain. In a transient ischemic attack, unlike a stroke, the blockage is brief, and there is no permanent damage."}

{"_id": "b88df706", "question": "Why should fenoldopam be avoided in acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke?", "answers": "The neurologist in charge should determine appropriate medications for each patient.\nBenzodiazepine medication is highly addictive. If the person had been taking fenoldopam prior to the stroke, acute withdrawal would be considered by the treating doctors.\nDuring my hemorrhagic stroke, I was given an anti-seizure medication to prevent seizure due to the stroke. I had lots of tests, then they transferred me to the ICU where they gradually reduced my blood pressure using various drugs. I received magnesium one day. potassium the next (or vice versa). I was surprised that one pill was enough to correct each imbalance.\nNone of my antihypertensive medications was a benzodiazepine similar to fenoldopam. I received an ACE inhibitor, a calcium channel blocker and a beta blocker."}
