Such a man would’ve rammed through immigration laws in a compliant Congress, as the GOP had control of both houses of the legislature from 2017 to 2019. Trump also had GOP congresspeople running scared, so he could’ve definitely rammed through whatever he wanted with regards to immigration.", "Laws passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President, as we all know, are much harder to dislodge or overturn by subsequent presidential administrations and Congresses. That’s why people with government experience concentrate almost exclusively on passing laws.", "Thankfully for us, Stephen Miller got Donald Trump, the laziest, most dense mofo this side of “Idiocracy.”", "Trump didn’t care to fix the immigration system in the way his followers wanted him to. That would’ve required hard work and, you know, learning how the government actually worked. So Trump, like has been his wont his whole life, did two things: 1) he made a lot of noise that he was “the busiest president ever!” and 2) found the easiest way to change policies that would least disturb his habits—which included watching hours upon hours upon hours of TV, tweeting about those hours of TV, and then yapping with his friends on the phone hatching elaborate revenge schemes against those who had crossed him. (Otherwise known as “executive time.”) And when he got tired of his “executive time,” he golfed. There was also a tremendous amount of golfing. So the easiest way that Trump found to unilaterally and lazily pass policy changes that he liked and that required the least amount of consultation and horse-trading with others (i.e. less work)—executive orders.", "Now the Trumpists are quickly finding out that electing a highly entertaining, incurious, lazy fat-ass for president does have its downsides—like all of Trump’s policies being rescinded unilaterally by Biden within a few months. Biden, like Trump, doesn’t even have to bother asking Congress for anything. All he needs is an army of constitutional lawyers to churn out those executive orders as efficiently as possible, and as fail-proof in the courts as possible. (Trump didn’t even bother to set up such an army of lawyers, which meant that the courts kept striking down his executive orders and policy changes at quite an embarrassing rate.) We’re in almost at week and Biden is about to pass 40 executive orders, which is more than Trump managed to pass in all of 2017.", "There will be little left of Trump’s legacy within government except his very wasteful tax cut laws passed in 2017 and those judges he rammed into the judiciary with the help of Moscow Mitch.", "So now Biden, with this decades of government experience, knows how to strike well, quickly, and efficiently, and has gathered a highly seasoned team that will make it happen. He’s not depending on his dense son-in-law and an inexperienced and addled twit—otherwise known as Steve Bannon—to make executive orders stick with the courts.

It’s the same reason he refuses to wear a mask (which would smear his makeup) or a walk in the rain without an umbrella (which would flatten his comb-over). President Trump is obsessed with looking good in public.

It’s clear that he sees that as the proper structure of the world: a constant battle, and anyone who you can take out must have deserved it. And that’s not an accusation, as much as an observation: he’s said as much about both his businesses and his administration: he likes to pit people against one another and see who comes out on top,", "For that reason, he has a constant and pathological need to pretend that he’s smarter, stronger, more informed, even taller than he is. You see that in his constant self-aggrandizing lies and assertions, you see that in the way he dresses and grooms and presents himself, you see it in the constant attempts to display dominance over other people.", "The reality of his aging and ill health isn’t just an unfortunate fact of life, to someone like Trump. It’s a failure that he has to keep under wraps, because he assumes it will be used against him (that is, after all, exactly what he would do to anyone else who had ill health). And so he does what he always does: he lies, he denies, he deflects, he makes up ridiculous and obviously false stories. And most people see right through all of that, but to some core who want to believe in him, well, they can believe just about anything. So, if President says he just decided to, on whim, to put together a motorcade and pop ’round for an unscheduled visit to the hospital, because he felt like getting a jump on his annual physical, well, that’s good enough for me!

The reason is because it threatens their wealth and power. Demonizing political enemies is routinely done.
