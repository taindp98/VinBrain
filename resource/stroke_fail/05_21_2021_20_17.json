Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator. (As per HSW)", "", "The video might clearly explain you that.", "The main use of it is to increase the efficiency to near 40%. Actually the efficiency of petrol engines will be around 25-35%..", "It depends on several things.", "This comes from personal experiences watching my father in law go through one.", "1) type of stroke. A Hemorrhage is easier to recover from than a blocked vessel as it involves releaving the pressure. A blocked vessel is much harder to clear quickly.", "There is still archangel for damage long term depending on reaction to symptoms. In his case it was too long if it was a clot, but because it was pressure he regained virtually all his functions back after removal and replacement of a piece of skull. Had it been a clot the time frame would have been FAR to long, almost 5-6 hours from symptoms to surgery to releive pressure.", "I say mostly when it comes to his recovery. There are still some cognitive issues from damage bit if you didn't know him, you'd never notice.", "2) location of the stroke. Certain locations are far less severe, but correct treatment is necessary. My grandfather had a stroke in his neck. Had he stayed at the hospital, and on bed rest, he'd have recovered with no issues. He believed nothing was wrong and felt fine in bed, so he checked himself out. He returned 2 hours later with a full on stroke and now struggles with movement on one side of his body.", "His stubbornness against staying still and the location caused the issue.", "3) time", "The longer you wait the worse the recovery. Regardless of type or location of the stroke.", "When the blood flow to your brain is interrupted, it is a medical emergency known as a stroke. When the flow of blood to your brain is stopped the time it takes to get medical treatment is critical. As many neurologists will tell you, “Time is brain”. What this means is anytime the flow of blood to your brain is interrupted, the damage is occurring and prompt medical treatment at a hospital is needed. The sooner you can get medical treatment, the more likely you are to have a better outcome.", "We usually think of stroke as a blood clot stopping the flow of blood in your brain. This is, in fact, the most common type of stroke called an ischemic stroke. According to the American Heart Association, 87% of stokes are estimated to be ischemic. There are three main types of stokes and all are considered medical emergencies.", "Another type of stoke is a hemorrhagic stroke.

When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Wellbutrin is an antidepressant with few of the side effects common to SSRIs — AND, instead of making you sluggish, it’s like being on Adderall. I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Then it kind of resolved before returning to dead weight. When my foot followed suit, I called the lady across the hall for some help.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Wellbutrin is an antidepressant with few of the side effects common to SSRIs — AND, instead of making you sluggish, it’s like being on Adderall. I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Then it kind of resolved before returning to dead weight. When my foot followed suit, I called the lady across the hall for some help.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Then it kind of resolved before returning to dead weight. When my foot followed suit, I called the lady across the hall for some help.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Then it kind of resolved before returning to dead weight. When my foot followed suit, I called the lady across the hall for some help. She called another coworker of mine, who called the nurse, who said in no uncertain terms to call 9–1–1. I got a nice ride to the hospital from some friendly EMS personnel.", "That was stroke #2.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Then it kind of resolved before returning to dead weight. When my foot followed suit, I called the lady across the hall for some help.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Wellbutrin is an antidepressant with few of the side effects common to SSRIs — AND, instead of making you sluggish, it’s like being on Adderall. I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Then it kind of resolved before returning to dead weight. When my foot followed suit, I called the lady across the hall for some help. She called another coworker of mine, who called the nurse, who said in no uncertain terms to call 9–1–1. I got a nice ride to the hospital from some friendly EMS personnel.", "That was stroke #2.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Wellbutrin is an antidepressant with few of the side effects common to SSRIs — AND, instead of making you sluggish, it’s like being on Adderall. I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Then it kind of resolved before returning to dead weight. When my foot followed suit, I called the lady across the hall for some help.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

Then it kind of resolved before returning to dead weight. When my foot followed suit, I called the lady across the hall for some help.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

A blocked vessel is much harder to clear quickly.", "There is still archangel for damage long term depending on reaction to symptoms. In his case it was too long if it was a clot, but because it was pressure he regained virtually all his functions back after removal and replacement of a piece of skull.

There are still some cognitive issues from damage bit if you didn't know him, you'd never notice.", "2) location of the stroke. Certain locations are far less severe, but correct treatment is necessary. My grandfather had a stroke in his neck. Had he stayed at the hospital, and on bed rest, he'd have recovered with no issues.

The sooner you can get medical treatment, the more likely you are to have a better outcome.", "We usually think of stroke as a blood clot stopping the flow of blood in your brain. This is, in fact, the most common type of stroke called an ischemic stroke. According to the American Heart Association, 87% of stokes are estimated to be ischemic.

When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

A Hemorrhage is easier to recover from than a blocked vessel as it involves releaving the pressure. A blocked vessel is much harder to clear quickly.", "There is still archangel for damage long term depending on reaction to symptoms. In his case it was too long if it was a clot, but because it was pressure he regained virtually all his functions back after removal and replacement of a piece of skull. Had it been a clot the time frame would have been FAR to long, almost 5-6 hours from symptoms to surgery to releive pressure.", "I say mostly when it comes to his recovery. There are still some cognitive issues from damage bit if you didn't know him, you'd never notice.", "2) location of the stroke. Certain locations are far less severe, but correct treatment is necessary. My grandfather had a stroke in his neck. Had he stayed at the hospital, and on bed rest, he'd have recovered with no issues. He believed nothing was wrong and felt fine in bed, so he checked himself out. He returned 2 hours later with a full on stroke and now struggles with movement on one side of his body.", "His stubbornness against staying still and the location caused the issue.", "3) time", "The longer you wait the worse the recovery. Regardless of type or location of the stroke.", "When the blood flow to your brain is interrupted, it is a medical emergency known as a stroke. When the flow of blood to your brain is stopped the time it takes to get medical treatment is critical. As many neurologists will tell you, “Time is brain”. What this means is anytime the flow of blood to your brain is interrupted, the damage is occurring and prompt medical treatment at a hospital is needed. The sooner you can get medical treatment, the more likely you are to have a better outcome.", "We usually think of stroke as a blood clot stopping the flow of blood in your brain. This is, in fact, the most common type of stroke called an ischemic stroke. According to the American Heart Association, 87% of stokes are estimated to be ischemic. There are three main types of stokes and all are considered medical emergencies.", "Another type of stoke is a hemorrhagic stroke.

When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

That makes no sense. Please call them stroke #1, #2, and #3.” I thought my nomenclature was pretty clever. ;)", "Two weeks later, I was sitting in my office down in Boulder when my arm became paralyzed. Then it kind of resolved before returning to dead weight. When my foot followed suit, I called the lady across the hall for some help. She called another coworker of mine, who called the nurse, who said in no uncertain terms to call 9–1–1. I got a nice ride to the hospital from some friendly EMS personnel.", "That was stroke #2.

Cie la vie, I suppose =(", "Now, 12 years later, I’ve gotten much better. Ironically, I became depressed after my third stroke, which led me to discover a medication that wakes me up called Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin is an antidepressant with few of the side effects common to SSRIs — AND, instead of making you sluggish, it’s like being on Adderall. I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

At some engine speeds, portions of the fuel mix go straight from the transfer ports out the exhaust without being burned. This leads to high fuel consumption and the ejection of unburned hydrocarbons. A solution is to use direct injection in which fuel is injected into the cylinder only after the ports close. This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. . The use of supercharger scavenging and direct injection eliminate these issues entirely.", "In addition, an oil-control ring needs to be added to the engine to stop oil leaking out the exhaust ports while the piston is close to top dead centre. There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

V. Ward, US patent 5454352 dated Oct 3, 1995. Although the engine runs on the four-stroke cycle, the cycle is completed in one revolution of the crankshaft, as in the Atkinson cycle engine. However, this is achieved by the use of an elliptical cam instead of the jointed linkage used in the Atkinson engine.The three stroke engine does not exist in reality but according to the patent this cycle can be termed as 3 stroke. In real it is a 2 stroke engine.

At some engine speeds, portions of the fuel mix go straight from the transfer ports out the exhaust without being burned.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke.

It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I was a master’s student at Caltech and had just moved to Colorado, where our little town with no traffic lights far exceeded life in the perpetual parking lot of Los Angeles. I hiked all around the Front Range with my beloved dog, Chaco, and our new puppy, Bonzo. Life was GOOD.", "One Friday in September, I flew back from Seattle — my first business trip. When I woke up the next morning, I seemed to me like I was ‘losing it’. I listened to my husband, a former lecturer at Caltech, preach for over an hour about the ins and outs of Java, which was pretty uncharacteristic of me. I slept for over ten hours, which was really unusual for me; I was used to life at Caltech, where problem sets that lasted all night had killed my ability to sleep for that long. My face was ‘lopsided’, to quote my husband. I got lost going down to Boulder for a football game — VERY uncharacteristic of me, as I was a geologist. (We’re known for being able to tell you where north is at all times.) And I exhibited aphasia, which is when you can’t recall the correct words for things.

That makes no sense. Please call them stroke #1, #2, and #3.” I thought my nomenclature was pretty clever. ;)", "Two weeks later, I was sitting in my office down in Boulder when my arm became paralyzed. Then it kind of resolved before returning to dead weight. When my foot followed suit, I called the lady across the hall for some help. She called another coworker of mine, who called the nurse, who said in no uncertain terms to call 9–1–1. I got a nice ride to the hospital from some friendly EMS personnel.", "That was stroke #2.

While my first stroke was somewhere in the back of my brain, and my second was in my right basal ganglia, my third was in my left basal ganglia.

Cie la vie, I suppose =(", "Now, 12 years later, I’ve gotten much better. Ironically, I became depressed after my third stroke, which led me to discover a medication that wakes me up called Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin is an antidepressant with few of the side effects common to SSRIs — AND, instead of making you sluggish, it’s like being on Adderall. I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

At some engine speeds, portions of the fuel mix go straight from the transfer ports out the exhaust without being burned. This leads to high fuel consumption and the ejection of unburned hydrocarbons. A solution is to use direct injection in which fuel is injected into the cylinder only after the ports close. This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. . The use of supercharger scavenging and direct injection eliminate these issues entirely.", "In addition, an oil-control ring needs to be added to the engine to stop oil leaking out the exhaust ports while the piston is close to top dead centre. There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

I haven’t had another stroke in 12 years, I’ve had a very good neurologist tell me that clots sometimes form in the area right around the hole *just because*, I’ve had doctors tell me to get my head screwed on straight — everybody knows a hole isnt enough without a hypercoagulable disease … I’ve pretty much just given up having any chance of ever knowing what caused my strokes.", "So please, figure it out! LOL", "Currently, we have no Heimlich maneuver for CVA, other than a substance called TPA, which is injected into the bloodstream and causes any clots to break apart, thus opening any blocked vesicles in the brain.

If you have a bleed in your brain causing symptoms of stroke, and you just happen to have some TPA laying around, and you just happen to still be capable of injecting said TPA into your vein to break up a clot you think you have, do you know what happens? The bleed in your brain bleeds faster, and you could bleed out, because TPA works on clots, not bleeds.", "So, you’re having stroke symptoms- sided weakness, some pins-and-needles, confusion- is it being caused by a clot or a bleed?

The scan will be read by a neurologist who will determine if there is a bleed- no bleed, you’ll be offered TPA. You say yes, the nurse adds a small bag of clear fluid to your IV.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago. And I’m finding it fairly difficult to remember what it was like to be me 12 years ago; it is difficult to know how awake I felt then versus now.

At some engine speeds, portions of the fuel mix go straight from the transfer ports out the exhaust without being burned. This leads to high fuel consumption and the ejection of unburned hydrocarbons. A solution is to use direct injection in which fuel is injected into the cylinder only after the ports close. This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. . The use of supercharger scavenging and direct injection eliminate these issues entirely.", "In addition, an oil-control ring needs to be added to the engine to stop oil leaking out the exhaust ports while the piston is close to top dead centre. There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

At some engine speeds, portions of the fuel mix go straight from the transfer ports out the exhaust without being burned.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke.

It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

I’ve also discovered a new therapy that has woken me up significantly; it’s a vision therapy pioneered by a doctor in Chicago.

A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

At some engine speeds, portions of the fuel mix go straight from the transfer ports out the exhaust without being burned.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. .

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. .

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

A smaller hospital might have one or two very qualified interventionists, but what happens if the INTERVENTIONIST you need for a heart attack THAT DAY is on vacation or out sick? Poor skills or unanticipated complications can lead to a situation where the only interventionist available in a smaller institution backs out of the procedure (this happened with my mother) or else continues to the point where a rupture of the blocked blood vessel occurs (this happened with a friend of mine). In such a rupture they will have to perform open heart surgery to save you. So, the skill level of the interventionist is key. It is better to have one who is better experienced in the many possibilities they will encounter and that they are equipped to work around these issues.", "DO NOT DRIVE YOURSELF to the emergency room! If you do you will lose many advantages that exist with arrival via EMS and you could find yourself too ill to drive, stuck in a traffic tie up or even faint on the way. DON’T DO IT! If you are having a heart attack it is imperative to get the EMS to where you are fast. Do not lay down while you wait. Sit in a comfortable chair. This assists your failing heart by keeping a little pressure on your vascular system. While you wait on the EMS be sure to take half a dozen aspirin to thin the blood. Tell the EMS how many aspirin you took. The EMS will also give you morphine to increase blood flow to the heart muscle which will aid in reducing the damage. On the way to the hospital the EMS will clear traffic with their flashing lights and be sending your vital signs to the hospital via telemetry. They will be alerting the on duty interventionist that you are on the way and to be ready to take action. They will be your passport STRAIGHT PAST check in and onto the operating table, hopefully with the interventionist and staff there waiting for your arrival.

This could lead to paralysis on one side of your face or body, slurring of speech and loss of control of your hands, arms, legs, etc. Impacts from stroke can be permanent or temporary. If temporary, it is called a TIA, a transient ischemic attack and may only last a few seconds after which full functioning of the body will return. A stroke is more serious and extremely disconcerting to the victim and sometimes accompanied by confusion or denial. That is, the victim minimizes the problem and does not seek IMMEDIATE emergency treatment which is paramount to regaining use of the paralyzed functions. I know stroke treatment technology has improved in the past few years, but it used to be the case that if the blockage is cleared in less than 15 minutes, permanent brain damage could be reduced or eliminated. Medical technology has been created to defeat the blockage. Take advantage of it. Time is of the essence. Don’t delay!", "In cases of heart attack and stroke have a plan prepared in advance.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile.

Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke.

It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

At some engine speeds, portions of the fuel mix go straight from the transfer ports out the exhaust without being burned. This leads to high fuel consumption and the ejection of unburned hydrocarbons. A solution is to use direct injection in which fuel is injected into the cylinder only after the ports close. This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. .

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. .

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

A smaller hospital might have one or two very qualified interventionists, but what happens if the INTERVENTIONIST you need for a heart attack THAT DAY is on vacation or out sick? Poor skills or unanticipated complications can lead to a situation where the only interventionist available in a smaller institution backs out of the procedure (this happened with my mother) or else continues to the point where a rupture of the blocked blood vessel occurs (this happened with a friend of mine). In such a rupture they will have to perform open heart surgery to save you. So, the skill level of the interventionist is key. It is better to have one who is better experienced in the many possibilities they will encounter and that they are equipped to work around these issues.", "DO NOT DRIVE YOURSELF to the emergency room! If you do you will lose many advantages that exist with arrival via EMS and you could find yourself too ill to drive, stuck in a traffic tie up or even faint on the way. DON’T DO IT! If you are having a heart attack it is imperative to get the EMS to where you are fast. Do not lay down while you wait. Sit in a comfortable chair. This assists your failing heart by keeping a little pressure on your vascular system. While you wait on the EMS be sure to take half a dozen aspirin to thin the blood. Tell the EMS how many aspirin you took. The EMS will also give you morphine to increase blood flow to the heart muscle which will aid in reducing the damage. On the way to the hospital the EMS will clear traffic with their flashing lights and be sending your vital signs to the hospital via telemetry. They will be alerting the on duty interventionist that you are on the way and to be ready to take action. They will be your passport STRAIGHT PAST check in and onto the operating table, hopefully with the interventionist and staff there waiting for your arrival.

This could lead to paralysis on one side of your face or body, slurring of speech and loss of control of your hands, arms, legs, etc. Impacts from stroke can be permanent or temporary. If temporary, it is called a TIA, a transient ischemic attack and may only last a few seconds after which full functioning of the body will return. A stroke is more serious and extremely disconcerting to the victim and sometimes accompanied by confusion or denial. That is, the victim minimizes the problem and does not seek IMMEDIATE emergency treatment which is paramount to regaining use of the paralyzed functions. I know stroke treatment technology has improved in the past few years, but it used to be the case that if the blockage is cleared in less than 15 minutes, permanent brain damage could be reduced or eliminated. Medical technology has been created to defeat the blockage. Take advantage of it. Time is of the essence. Don’t delay!", "In cases of heart attack and stroke have a plan prepared in advance. If your family history indicates possibility of heart attack or stroke make a plan!

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so.

What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile.

Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke.

It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

At some engine speeds, portions of the fuel mix go straight from the transfer ports out the exhaust without being burned. This leads to high fuel consumption and the ejection of unburned hydrocarbons. A solution is to use direct injection in which fuel is injected into the cylinder only after the ports close. This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. .

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. .

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

Not only do they have top skill levels available there, they have a deep POOL of highly qualified interventionists available. A smaller hospital might have one or two very qualified interventionists, but what happens if the INTERVENTIONIST you need for a heart attack THAT DAY is on vacation or out sick? Poor skills or unanticipated complications can lead to a situation where the only interventionist available in a smaller institution backs out of the procedure (this happened with my mother) or else continues to the point where a rupture of the blocked blood vessel occurs (this happened with a friend of mine). In such a rupture they will have to perform open heart surgery to save you. So, the skill level of the interventionist is key. It is better to have one who is better experienced in the many possibilities they will encounter and that they are equipped to work around these issues.", "DO NOT DRIVE YOURSELF to the emergency room! If you do you will lose many advantages that exist with arrival via EMS and you could find yourself too ill to drive, stuck in a traffic tie up or even faint on the way. DON’T DO IT! If you are having a heart attack it is imperative to get the EMS to where you are fast. Do not lay down while you wait. Sit in a comfortable chair. This assists your failing heart by keeping a little pressure on your vascular system. While you wait on the EMS be sure to take half a dozen aspirin to thin the blood. Tell the EMS how many aspirin you took. The EMS will also give you morphine to increase blood flow to the heart muscle which will aid in reducing the damage. On the way to the hospital the EMS will clear traffic with their flashing lights and be sending your vital signs to the hospital via telemetry. They will be alerting the on duty interventionist that you are on the way and to be ready to take action. They will be your passport STRAIGHT PAST check in and onto the operating table, hopefully with the interventionist and staff there waiting for your arrival. So time spent getting the EMS is not time wasted. It is time saved. Time saved is heart tissue saved!", "Strokes are blockages of blood supply to a section of your brain. This could lead to paralysis on one side of your face or body, slurring of speech and loss of control of your hands, arms, legs, etc. Impacts from stroke can be permanent or temporary. If temporary, it is called a TIA, a transient ischemic attack and may only last a few seconds after which full functioning of the body will return. A stroke is more serious and extremely disconcerting to the victim and sometimes accompanied by confusion or denial. That is, the victim minimizes the problem and does not seek IMMEDIATE emergency treatment which is paramount to regaining use of the paralyzed functions. I know stroke treatment technology has improved in the past few years, but it used to be the case that if the blockage is cleared in less than 15 minutes, permanent brain damage could be reduced or eliminated. Medical technology has been created to defeat the blockage. Take advantage of it. Time is of the essence. Don’t delay!", "In cases of heart attack and stroke have a plan prepared in advance.

Exotic materials (ceramics?) might be needed for such an engine to last a long time.", "The second is water.", "If there is no condenser to turn exhausted steam back to liquid, then you’ll need a tank of water, which will probably be used at about the same rate as gasoline. Even if you didn’t mind having this tank, filling it could be a problem. Even if the engine can use tap water, you’ll need to fill it every time you get gas… there’s no convenient water dispenser next to the fuel pump. Did I mention that Bruce Crower didn’t even attempt to use tap water, and only tried running his engine with distilled water? Distilled water isn’t very expensive, but it’s not something presently available at gas stations.", "If there is a condenser, you won’t need to fill the water tank nearly so often, but this component could be heavy.", "A third problem is balancing to minimize vibration — the only good arrangement that comes to mind is an inline 6 cylinder engine with 3 pistons going up together and the other three going down together.", "A fourth possible problem is that, if a combined air exhaust/steam exhaust is used, then the steam will dilute the air exhaust, throw of the O2 sensors, and interfere with the working of the catalytic converter. Using separate exhaust systems can solve that, but will make your engine look like a mutant octopus, since there will be three manifolds (intake air, exhaust air, steam).", "A fifth problem, related to the first, is that high temperature high pressure steam, even without the assistance of oxygen, can degrade a variety of materials.", "The final problem is that it is new and strange, and the auto industry doesn’t like radical change.", "3 Things to Do When Someone Is Having a Stroke:", "1.

Give someone you think is having a stroke this FAST test\nfrom the National Stroke Association.", "2. Note the time you first see symptoms", "A clot-busting medication called tPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, can be given to someone if they’re having a stroke, potentially reversing or stopping symptoms from developing. But it has to be given within 4.5 hours of the start of symptoms, Jean says.", "Patients may also be candidates for more advanced therapies, such as endovascular treatments, at Penn Medicine. Endovascular treatments can involve surgically removing a clot that caused a stroke, or fixing an aneurysm—which is a swollen blood vessel that bursts and causes pressure in the brain. Endovascular treatments for ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke, must be administered within 24 hours of symptom onset, and earlier treatment improves outcome so time is critically important.", "“If a witness sees someone having a stroke, it would be helpful if they look at what time the symptoms started,” she says. “That way, the emergency staff can make a more informed decision about treatment options.”", "3. Perform CPR, if necessary", "Most stroke patients don’t require CPR, Jean notes. But if your friend or spouse is unconscious when you find her, check her pulse and breathing. If you find none, call 911 and start CPR while you’re waiting for the ambulance to arrive.", "You can also ask the 911 dispatcher to walk you through how to perform CPR, which consists of repeated, steady chest compressions, according to the American Heart Association", "(OR)", "1. Let that person go to sleep or talk you out of calling 911", "Stroke survivors often complain of suddenly feeling very sleepy when a stroke first happens.", "“A lot of patients come in and say they went to sleep for a few hours before they came to the hospital because they were tired,” Jean notes.", "But time is of the essence. “The medication we can give a stroke survivor is time-sensitive,” she adds. “They should not go to sleep, and they should not call their primary care doctor 2 days from now. Instead, they should just go immediately to the emergency room.”", "And no matter how much someone might try to talk you out of taking them to the hospital, don’t let them, says Jean.", "2. Give them medication, food, or drinks", "There are 2 kinds of strokes:", "“80% of strokes are ischemic ones, but if you’re in that 20% and your stroke was caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the head, you don’t want the victim to have aspirin,” Jean says. “And you can’t tell which one it is until you get to the emergency room and you get a CAT scan.”", "To be safe, don’t give someone who has a stroke any medication.", "You also shouldn’t give him food or drinks before the ambulance comes. “Sometimes, a stroke affects their ability to swallow,” Jean says.", "3.

As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

At some engine speeds, portions of the fuel mix go straight from the transfer ports out the exhaust without being burned. This leads to high fuel consumption and the ejection of unburned hydrocarbons. A solution is to use direct injection in which fuel is injected into the cylinder only after the ports close. This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. .

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke.

It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

Websites like Mayo Clinic and others will clearly define symptoms for you. Educate yourself with these symptoms, it could save your life.", "A heart attack is “usually” is most commonly caused by an artery blockage which shuts off the blood supply to a section of your heart which results in killing the tissue in that part of the heart and causes scar tissue. Symptoms the person feels may change depending on where the blockage is located. What is not talked about much is that survival rates for females heart attacks are much lower than men. This lower survival rate is due to the “typical” female heart being smaller than the “typical” male heart. Thus, the smaller heart is less able to withstand the rigors of the attack. So, earlier detection and preventative measures are especially important to females.", "For earlier detection, the health provider can use several means including performing an angiogram a procedure which uses radioactive dye and associated imaging to locate the blockage(s).", "Blockages may potentially be resolved by stent placement which is least invasive or open heart surgery. The stent placement is performed by a surgeon who is sometimes referred to as an “interventionist”. This is a relatively common procedure. Open heart surgery is much more involved and I will not go into the details here.", "For a stent placement, it is important to get the very BEST interventionist working on you as these procedures require skill and experience. If given a choice of a well known, acclaimed heart clinics like Methodist Debakey or St. Luke’s in Houston, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, or Duke in NC go there by all means. Not only do they have top skill levels available there, they have a deep POOL of highly qualified interventionists available. A smaller hospital might have one or two very qualified interventionists, but what happens if the INTERVENTIONIST you need for a heart attack THAT DAY is on vacation or out sick? Poor skills or unanticipated complications can lead to a situation where the only interventionist available in a smaller institution backs out of the procedure (this happened with my mother) or else continues to the point where a rupture of the blocked blood vessel occurs (this happened with a friend of mine). In such a rupture they will have to perform open heart surgery to save you. So, the skill level of the interventionist is key. It is better to have one who is better experienced in the many possibilities they will encounter and that they are equipped to work around these issues.", "DO NOT DRIVE YOURSELF to the emergency room! If you do you will lose many advantages that exist with arrival via EMS and you could find yourself too ill to drive, stuck in a traffic tie up or even faint on the way. DON’T DO IT! If you are having a heart attack it is imperative to get the EMS to where you are fast. Do not lay down while you wait. Sit in a comfortable chair. This assists your failing heart by keeping a little pressure on your vascular system. While you wait on the EMS be sure to take half a dozen aspirin to thin the blood. Tell the EMS how many aspirin you took. The EMS will also give you morphine to increase blood flow to the heart muscle which will aid in reducing the damage. On the way to the hospital the EMS will clear traffic with their flashing lights and be sending your vital signs to the hospital via telemetry. They will be alerting the on duty interventionist that you are on the way and to be ready to take action.

This could lead to paralysis on one side of your face or body, slurring of speech and loss of control of your hands, arms, legs, etc. Impacts from stroke can be permanent or temporary. If temporary, it is called a TIA, a transient ischemic attack and may only last a few seconds after which full functioning of the body will return. A stroke is more serious and extremely disconcerting to the victim and sometimes accompanied by confusion or denial. That is, the victim minimizes the problem and does not seek IMMEDIATE emergency treatment which is paramount to regaining use of the paralyzed functions. I know stroke treatment technology has improved in the past few years, but it used to be the case that if the blockage is cleared in less than 15 minutes, permanent brain damage could be reduced or eliminated.

Exotic materials (ceramics?) might be needed for such an engine to last a long time.", "The second is water.", "If there is no condenser to turn exhausted steam back to liquid, then you’ll need a tank of water, which will probably be used at about the same rate as gasoline. Even if you didn’t mind having this tank, filling it could be a problem. Even if the engine can use tap water, you’ll need to fill it every time you get gas… there’s no convenient water dispenser next to the fuel pump. Did I mention that Bruce Crower didn’t even attempt to use tap water, and only tried running his engine with distilled water? Distilled water isn’t very expensive, but it’s not something presently available at gas stations.", "If there is a condenser, you won’t need to fill the water tank nearly so often, but this component could be heavy.", "A third problem is balancing to minimize vibration — the only good arrangement that comes to mind is an inline 6 cylinder engine with 3 pistons going up together and the other three going down together.", "A fourth possible problem is that, if a combined air exhaust/steam exhaust is used, then the steam will dilute the air exhaust, throw of the O2 sensors, and interfere with the working of the catalytic converter. Using separate exhaust systems can solve that, but will make your engine look like a mutant octopus, since there will be three manifolds (intake air, exhaust air, steam).", "A fifth problem, related to the first, is that high temperature high pressure steam, even without the assistance of oxygen, can degrade a variety of materials.", "The final problem is that it is new and strange, and the auto industry doesn’t like radical change.", "3 Things to Do When Someone Is Having a Stroke:", "1. Call 911 immediately", "If you do nothing else, act quickly to call 911.", "“The hardest thing you have to do is recognize symptoms of a stroke,” Jean explains. “If you do observe any symptoms, you should call 911 immediately.

Give someone you think is having a stroke this FAST test\nfrom the National Stroke Association.", "2. Note the time you first see symptoms", "A clot-busting medication called tPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, can be given to someone if they’re having a stroke, potentially reversing or stopping symptoms from developing. But it has to be given within 4.5 hours of the start of symptoms, Jean says.", "Patients may also be candidates for more advanced therapies, such as endovascular treatments, at Penn Medicine. Endovascular treatments can involve surgically removing a clot that caused a stroke, or fixing an aneurysm—which is a swollen blood vessel that bursts and causes pressure in the brain. Endovascular treatments for ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke, must be administered within 24 hours of symptom onset, and earlier treatment improves outcome so time is critically important.", "“If a witness sees someone having a stroke, it would be helpful if they look at what time the symptoms started,” she says. “That way, the emergency staff can make a more informed decision about treatment options.”", "3. Perform CPR, if necessary", "Most stroke patients don’t require CPR, Jean notes. But if your friend or spouse is unconscious when you find her, check her pulse and breathing. If you find none, call 911 and start CPR while you’re waiting for the ambulance to arrive.", "You can also ask the 911 dispatcher to walk you through how to perform CPR, which consists of repeated, steady chest compressions, according to the American Heart Association", "(OR)", "1. Let that person go to sleep or talk you out of calling 911", "Stroke survivors often complain of suddenly feeling very sleepy when a stroke first happens.", "“A lot of patients come in and say they went to sleep for a few hours before they came to the hospital because they were tired,” Jean notes.", "But time is of the essence. “The medication we can give a stroke survivor is time-sensitive,” she adds. “They should not go to sleep, and they should not call their primary care doctor 2 days from now. Instead, they should just go immediately to the emergency room.”", "And no matter how much someone might try to talk you out of taking them to the hospital, don’t let them, says Jean.", "2. Give them medication, food, or drinks", "There are 2 kinds of strokes:", "“80% of strokes are ischemic ones, but if you’re in that 20% and your stroke was caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the head, you don’t want the victim to have aspirin,” Jean says. “And you can’t tell which one it is until you get to the emergency room and you get a CAT scan.”", "To be safe, don’t give someone who has a stroke any medication.", "You also shouldn’t give him food or drinks before the ambulance comes. “Sometimes, a stroke affects their ability to swallow,” Jean says.", "3.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

Distilled water isn’t very expensive, but it’s not something presently available at gas stations.", "If there is a condenser, you won’t need to fill the water tank nearly so often, but this component could be heavy.", "A third problem is balancing to minimize vibration — the only good arrangement that comes to mind is an inline 6 cylinder engine with 3 pistons going up together and the other three going down together.", "A fourth possible problem is that, if a combined air exhaust/steam exhaust is used, then the steam will dilute the air exhaust, throw of the O2 sensors, and interfere with the working of the catalytic converter. Using separate exhaust systems can solve that, but will make your engine look like a mutant octopus, since there will be three manifolds (intake air, exhaust air, steam).", "A fifth problem, related to the first, is that high temperature high pressure steam, even without the assistance of oxygen, can degrade a variety of materials.", "The final problem is that it is new and strange, and the auto industry doesn’t like radical change.", "3 Things to Do When Someone Is Having a Stroke:", "1. Call 911 immediately", "If you do nothing else, act quickly to call 911.", "“The hardest thing you have to do is recognize symptoms of a stroke,” Jean explains. “If you do observe any symptoms, you should call 911 immediately. You should also immediately tell the 911 dispatcher, ‘I think I’m having a stroke’ or ‘I think my loved one is.’”", "Not sure what the symptoms of a stroke are? Give someone you think is having a stroke this FAST test\nfrom the National Stroke Association.", "2. Note the time you first see symptoms", "A clot-busting medication called tPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, can be given to someone if they’re having a stroke, potentially reversing or stopping symptoms from developing. But it has to be given within 4.5 hours of the start of symptoms, Jean says.", "Patients may also be candidates for more advanced therapies, such as endovascular treatments, at Penn Medicine. Endovascular treatments can involve surgically removing a clot that caused a stroke, or fixing an aneurysm—which is a swollen blood vessel that bursts and causes pressure in the brain. Endovascular treatments for ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke, must be administered within 24 hours of symptom onset, and earlier treatment improves outcome so time is critically important.", "“If a witness sees someone having a stroke, it would be helpful if they look at what time the symptoms started,” she says. “That way, the emergency staff can make a more informed decision about treatment options.”", "3. Perform CPR, if necessary", "Most stroke patients don’t require CPR, Jean notes. But if your friend or spouse is unconscious when you find her, check her pulse and breathing. If you find none, call 911 and start CPR while you’re waiting for the ambulance to arrive.", "You can also ask the 911 dispatcher to walk you through how to perform CPR, which consists of repeated, steady chest compressions, according to the American Heart Association", "(OR)", "1. Let that person go to sleep or talk you out of calling 911", "Stroke survivors often complain of suddenly feeling very sleepy when a stroke first happens.", "“A lot of patients come in and say they went to sleep for a few hours before they came to the hospital because they were tired,” Jean notes.", "But time is of the essence. “The medication we can give a stroke survivor is time-sensitive,” she adds. “They should not go to sleep, and they should not call their primary care doctor 2 days from now. Instead, they should just go immediately to the emergency room.”", "And no matter how much someone might try to talk you out of taking them to the hospital, don’t let them, says Jean.", "2. Give them medication, food, or drinks", "There are 2 kinds of strokes:", "“80% of strokes are ischemic ones, but if you’re in that 20% and your stroke was caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the head, you don’t want the victim to have aspirin,” Jean says. “And you can’t tell which one it is until you get to the emergency room and you get a CAT scan.”", "To be safe, don’t give someone who has a stroke any medication.", "You also shouldn’t give him food or drinks before the ambulance comes. “Sometimes, a stroke affects their ability to swallow,” Jean says.", "3. Drive yourself or someone else to the emergency room", "It might seem like a good idea to drive a stroke victim to the nearest emergency room. But Jean says, “If someone is severely affected by a stroke, then you’re better off calling 911.”", "Emergency responders can start life-saving treatment for that person on the way to the emergency room, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says.", "You also don’t want to drive yourself to a hospital in the event that your stroke symptoms worsen and impair your ability to drive safely.", "First of oil, most modern and old 2 stroke motorcycle engines have a separate oil tank that pumps special 2 stroke oil to the crankshaft bearings and the cylinder walls to lubricate them “obviously”, it is then burned with the air/ petrol mixture that is sucked in through its crankcase and then burnt after combustion has taken place and this burnt oil is what causes 2 stroke to belch out blue smoke so effectively the oil that is pumped is total loss unlike a 4 stroke/ cycle engine where where the combustion chamber is totally oil free..a 2 stroke engine receives fresh oil on every piston stroke unlike a 4 stroke engine that has to be changed at intervals from 3 to 12 thousand miles depending on the climate of the country, however, some 2 stroke engines like chain saws have to have the oil mixed with the petrol/ gasoline before it is put into the fuel tank, most 2 stroke engines will require a new cylinder or a rebore with fresh new pistons a long way before a 4 stroke engine where the engine oil is not Total loss.🏍", "Two stroke gives more power than four stroke.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Symptoms the person feels may change depending on where the blockage is located. What is not talked about much is that survival rates for females heart attacks are much lower than men. This lower survival rate is due to the “typical” female heart being smaller than the “typical” male heart. Thus, the smaller heart is less able to withstand the rigors of the attack. So, earlier detection and preventative measures are especially important to females.", "For earlier detection, the health provider can use several means including performing an angiogram a procedure which uses radioactive dye and associated imaging to locate the blockage(s).", "Blockages may potentially be resolved by stent placement which is least invasive or open heart surgery. The stent placement is performed by a surgeon who is sometimes referred to as an “interventionist”. This is a relatively common procedure. Open heart surgery is much more involved and I will not go into the details here.", "For a stent placement, it is important to get the very BEST interventionist working on you as these procedures require skill and experience.

Not only do they have top skill levels available there, they have a deep POOL of highly qualified interventionists available. A smaller hospital might have one or two very qualified interventionists, but what happens if the INTERVENTIONIST you need for a heart attack THAT DAY is on vacation or out sick? Poor skills or unanticipated complications can lead to a situation where the only interventionist available in a smaller institution backs out of the procedure (this happened with my mother) or else continues to the point where a rupture of the blocked blood vessel occurs (this happened with a friend of mine). In such a rupture they will have to perform open heart surgery to save you. So, the skill level of the interventionist is key.

This assists your failing heart by keeping a little pressure on your vascular system. While you wait on the EMS be sure to take half a dozen aspirin to thin the blood. Tell the EMS how many aspirin you took. The EMS will also give you morphine to increase blood flow to the heart muscle which will aid in reducing the damage.

Endovascular treatments can involve surgically removing a clot that caused a stroke, or fixing an aneurysm—which is a swollen blood vessel that bursts and causes pressure in the brain. Endovascular treatments for ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke, must be administered within 24 hours of symptom onset, and earlier treatment improves outcome so time is critically important.", "“If a witness sees someone having a stroke, it would be helpful if they look at what time the symptoms started,” she says. “That way, the emergency staff can make a more informed decision about treatment options.”", "3. Perform CPR, if necessary", "Most stroke patients don’t require CPR, Jean notes. But if your friend or spouse is unconscious when you find her, check her pulse and breathing. If you find none, call 911 and start CPR while you’re waiting for the ambulance to arrive.", "You can also ask the 911 dispatcher to walk you through how to perform CPR, which consists of repeated, steady chest compressions, according to the American Heart Association", "(OR)", "1.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. . The use of supercharger scavenging and direct injection eliminate these issues entirely.", "In addition, an oil-control ring needs to be added to the engine to stop oil leaking out the exhaust ports while the piston is close to top dead centre. There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

If you do you will lose many advantages that exist with arrival via EMS and you could find yourself too ill to drive, stuck in a traffic tie up or even faint on the way. DON’T DO IT! If you are having a heart attack it is imperative to get the EMS to where you are fast. Do not lay down while you wait. Sit in a comfortable chair. This assists your failing heart by keeping a little pressure on your vascular system. While you wait on the EMS be sure to take half a dozen aspirin to thin the blood. Tell the EMS how many aspirin you took. The EMS will also give you morphine to increase blood flow to the heart muscle which will aid in reducing the damage. On the way to the hospital the EMS will clear traffic with their flashing lights and be sending your vital signs to the hospital via telemetry. They will be alerting the on duty interventionist that you are on the way and to be ready to take action. They will be your passport STRAIGHT PAST check in and onto the operating table, hopefully with the interventionist and staff there waiting for your arrival. So time spent getting the EMS is not time wasted. It is time saved. Time saved is heart tissue saved!", "Strokes are blockages of blood supply to a section of your brain. This could lead to paralysis on one side of your face or body, slurring of speech and loss of control of your hands, arms, legs, etc. Impacts from stroke can be permanent or temporary. If temporary, it is called a TIA, a transient ischemic attack and may only last a few seconds after which full functioning of the body will return. A stroke is more serious and extremely disconcerting to the victim and sometimes accompanied by confusion or denial. That is, the victim minimizes the problem and does not seek IMMEDIATE emergency treatment which is paramount to regaining use of the paralyzed functions. I know stroke treatment technology has improved in the past few years, but it used to be the case that if the blockage is cleared in less than 15 minutes, permanent brain damage could be reduced or eliminated. Medical technology has been created to defeat the blockage. Take advantage of it. Time is of the essence. Don’t delay!", "In cases of heart attack and stroke have a plan prepared in advance.

Did I mention that Bruce Crower didn’t even attempt to use tap water, and only tried running his engine with distilled water? Distilled water isn’t very expensive, but it’s not something presently available at gas stations.", "If there is a condenser, you won’t need to fill the water tank nearly so often, but this component could be heavy.", "A third problem is balancing to minimize vibration — the only good arrangement that comes to mind is an inline 6 cylinder engine with 3 pistons going up together and the other three going down together.", "A fourth possible problem is that, if a combined air exhaust/steam exhaust is used, then the steam will dilute the air exhaust, throw of the O2 sensors, and interfere with the working of the catalytic converter.

Give someone you think is having a stroke this FAST test\nfrom the National Stroke Association.", "2. Note the time you first see symptoms", "A clot-busting medication called tPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, can be given to someone if they’re having a stroke, potentially reversing or stopping symptoms from developing. But it has to be given within 4.5 hours of the start of symptoms, Jean says.", "Patients may also be candidates for more advanced therapies, such as endovascular treatments, at Penn Medicine. Endovascular treatments can involve surgically removing a clot that caused a stroke, or fixing an aneurysm—which is a swollen blood vessel that bursts and causes pressure in the brain. Endovascular treatments for ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke, must be administered within 24 hours of symptom onset, and earlier treatment improves outcome so time is critically important.", "“If a witness sees someone having a stroke, it would be helpful if they look at what time the symptoms started,” she says. “That way, the emergency staff can make a more informed decision about treatment options.”", "3. Perform CPR, if necessary", "Most stroke patients don’t require CPR, Jean notes. But if your friend or spouse is unconscious when you find her, check her pulse and breathing. If you find none, call 911 and start CPR while you’re waiting for the ambulance to arrive.", "You can also ask the 911 dispatcher to walk you through how to perform CPR, which consists of repeated, steady chest compressions, according to the American Heart Association", "(OR)", "1.

Instead, they should just go immediately to the emergency room.”", "And no matter how much someone might try to talk you out of taking them to the hospital, don’t let them, says Jean.", "2. Give them medication, food, or drinks", "There are 2 kinds of strokes:", "“80% of strokes are ischemic ones, but if you’re in that 20% and your stroke was caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the head, you don’t want the victim to have aspirin,” Jean says. “And you can’t tell which one it is until you get to the emergency room and you get a CAT scan.”", "To be safe, don’t give someone who has a stroke any medication.", "You also shouldn’t give him food or drinks before the ambulance comes. “Sometimes, a stroke affects their ability to swallow,” Jean says.", "3.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft. Below is a diagram of the engine.", "Intake air comes into the engine and is pressurized by some meathod, either a roots blower as shown above, A centrifugal supercharger, or like EMD engines, a hybrid turbo-supercharger", "6–71 Detroit Roots Blower", "EMD Turbocharger- note gear drive", "This pressurized inlet air is fed into the cylinders through a series of ports in the bottom of the cylinder in a process known as scavenging. The exhaust valves on the top of the cylinder are open at the same time that the piston has gone below the inlet ports allowing the pressurized inlet air coming in to push the exhaust out of the cylinder.", "EMD Power assembly- note the inlet ports on the bottom of the cylinder and the exhaust at the top.", "The exhaust valves close, the piston covers up the inlet port, and compresses the air. At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

At some engine speeds, portions of the fuel mix go straight from the transfer ports out the exhaust without being burned. This leads to high fuel consumption and the ejection of unburned hydrocarbons. A solution is to use direct injection in which fuel is injected into the cylinder only after the ports close. This drastically reduces both problems.", "The other source of pollution comes from the total loss lubrication in which unburned two-stroke oil passes directly out the exhaust ports. A solution is to replace the total oil loss system with full crankcase lubrication as found in four-stroke engines. To do this, the crankcase can no longer be used for scavenging, therefore a supercharger needs to be used for supplying the scavenging air. The drawback is that adds weight complexity, and expense to what was a lightweight inexpensive engine.", "Edit… I forgot to mentions something that many people find really annoying. That is the extremely lumpy idle and ring ding ding noise when closing the throttle. This is caused by uneven air and fuel supply caused by indirect injection and crankcase scavenging. . The use of supercharger scavenging and direct injection eliminate these issues entirely.", "In addition, an oil-control ring needs to be added to the engine to stop oil leaking out the exhaust ports while the piston is close to top dead centre. There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke. In addition to using full crankcase lubrication, a means for cooling the underside needs to be provided, such as an oil jet. It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens. This can have disadvantage of lowering the maximum permissible rpm of the engine due to higher piston and connecting rod loads.", "So, the reasons two strokes are no longer used can be dealt with, but it may be cheaper to build a four stroke despite the extra valves, springs, and cams and cam chain.", "No, strokes don’t cause Alzheimer’s.", "However, Alzheimer’s is just one type of dementia, and there are quite a few other types, with the largest being “mixed”, or Alzheimer’s and something else.

Thank your lucky stars.", "(Play the gifs below while reading to get a better understanding)", "Two Stroke Engines", "As the name suggest, the two stroke engine cycle consists of two strokes - namely the intake/exhaust stroke and the compression/combustion stroke.", "1. During the intake/exhaust stroke, the fuel-air mixture from the carburettor is taken in from the intake valve and the exhaust from the previous cycle is expelled from the exhaust shaft. As you may have already guessed/known, this exchange of fuel-air mixture with exhaust gases is not perfect. As demonstrated below, the piston creates an area of low pressure when it is at the beginning of the intake stroke and sucks in air from both intake and exhaust shafts. Hence, exhaust gases are sucked back into the engine for combustion and the fuel-air mixture from the intake shaft are expelled.\n2. During the compression/combustion stroke, the fuel-air mixture (along with some exhaust gases) is compressed. This is the first half of the cycle, until the the piston reaches it's highest point in the cylinder. The next half of the cycle occurs when a spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture when the piston is at it's peak, thereby causing the violent expansion of gases and pushing the piston back down to power the crankshaft and ultimately your vehicle. (This is sometimes also know as the \"Power Stroke\")", "The above two step repeat themselves again and again, and that's what makes a two stroke engined vehicle move.", "", "Advantages of two strokes - Due to the existence of only two strokes, the \"Power Stroke\" occurs every half cycle. One in every two strokes produces power (whereas in four stroke engines, only one in four strokes produces power). This gives two stroke engines a significantly higher power-to-weight ratio than four strokes. Hence, even today chainsaws, lawnmowers and other small engined tools have a two stroke engine instead of a four stroke.\nDisadvantages of two strokes - Very low fuel economy due to the combustion of exhaust gases and the escape of fuel. Since exhaust gases are re-compressed and hydrocarbons (fuel) are expelled from the exhaust, the exhaust is rich with carbon (causing it's characteristic white colour) and unusually high amounts of carbon monoxide.", "Four Stroke Engines", "The four stroke engine consists of four strokes - namely Intake, Compression, Combustion and Exhaust.", "1. Intake Stroke - Fuel-air mixture (shown in blue below) is sucked in to the piston when it as it's lowest point due the creation of low pressure. It is important to remember that unlike two stroke engines, four strokes have valves. During this stroke, only the intake valve opens up and a fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder.\n2. Compression Stroke - The contents of the cylinder are compressed by the momentum of the crankshaft and piston caused by previous strokes. For petrol/gasoline the compression ratio is usually between 8:1 and 12:1, whereas for diesel, the compression ratio is between 14:1 and 25:1. This is because diesel is a much denser fuel (oil) and requires higher temperatures to reach it's combustion point. If you remember from school, according to Gay Lussac's Law, temperature increases with the increase in temperature (Check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_laws\n)\n3. Combustion Stroke - For petrol/gasoline engines, the compressed fuel is combusted with the help of a spark plug. But for a diesel engine, the compressed fuel automatically combusts due to the (relatively) high temperatures inside the engine. This stroke is what powers the engine, causing the piston to be forced down due to the expansion of gases in the cylinder.\n4. Exhaust Stroke - The contents of the cylinder after combustion are expelled when the piston moves up due to momentum carried over by previous cycles. Now, the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust is let out.", "", "", "Advantages of four strokes - Much higher fuel economy than two stroke engines because the intake and exhaust strokes are treated as two different steps.\nDisadvantages of four strokes - Their power-to-weight ratio is much smaller as compared to two stokes because only one in ever four strokes produces power.", "Basically to understand the answer you need to know the components of a four stroke engine..", "2.

In a two stroke Diesel engine, you have a power cycle every rotation of the crankshaft.

At top dead Center the injector injects fuel into the cylinder which ignited and pushes the piston down until the valves and ports are opened and the process repeats.", "This is a very simple and reliable setup and can take a lot of abuse and keep running. But as I mentioned, efficiency and emissions are not these engines strong suits. I will explain why.", "Efficiency", "I hear a lot of old diesel finatics preach about the efficiency of the two stroke engine, but it’s not so. They are great for power and acceleration due to the extra power stroke they get over the four stroke, but they are limited. Why? Because your engine is an air pump first and foremost. What does that effect.", "Well, one of the most crucial aspects of an engines efficiency is its intake and exhaust durations, measured in degrees of crank rotation. Guys who build performance engines know this all too well. So let’s look at a four stroke engine. Below is a cam spec sheet for a small block Chevy I’m going to use as my example.", "So let’s look at our cam profile. Our intake valve opens at 49 degrees before top dead Center, and closes at 81 degrees after bottom dead Center, for a total of 310 degrees. Our exhaust valve opens at 98 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closes 42 degrees after top dead Center for a total of 320 degrees. This gives you plenty of time for air to come in and go out.", "Now look at the two stroke. It’s inlet and exhaust duration is limited to the time that both the inlet port at the bottom, and exhaust valve on top are open. Let’s say hypothetically you inlet port is uncovered by the piston at 60 degrees before bottom dead Center, and closed off at 60 degrees after bottom dead Center. Your duration is only 120 degrees to get your intake air in and your exhaust out, which is a far cry shorter then the 310 that the four stroke gets. This is the number one limiting factor on a two stroke, and it can’t be solved.", "Emissions", "So, why can’t a two stroke Diesel engine make emissions? Simply put, because they are so dirty. Because the piston throws oil up the cylinder, some inevitably gets into the intake port and burned. Oil makes horrible fuel and doesn’t burn clean, adding to carbon, particulate, and other emissions.", "Just so you can see what we have to deal with, this is what the air box on an EMD engine looks like. This is the source of the combustion air for the engine.", "The two stroke engine’s flywheels can be lighter than a 4 stroke flywheel because they don’t have to carry the load for the extra exhaust and inlet stroke but are not always lighter than a similar power rated four cycle engine, as the flywheels, are usually solid steel or nodular cast iron and are typically larger in diameter than the stroke of the camshaft as the crank pin is pressed into a hole in each one. The loading on the crank pin determines its size, therefore the size of the hole in the flywheel and the amount of metal radially outside the hole.", "The volume of the crank case is determined by the flywheel size, and if the piston, on the down stroke has to develop sufficient pressure to force the air/fuel charge into the cylinder through the transfer port, to develop sufficient pressure, the crank case must be filled as much as possible by the flywheels, so, by necessity the flywheels may end up quite heavy. If it was absolutely imperative the flywheels must be very light to get more rapid acceleration, the flywheels could be cast or forged in the shape of a typical 4-stroke crankshaft, then a light metal, could be cast to it to fill up the crank case. Cost goes up with performance but, for a professional racer, it could be worth it. The size of the flywheel is also taken into consideration of ease of starting and operating rpm band, needing to be large and heavy if the engine is to operate at very low speeds and if also to have great torque at low speed. Two cycle engines are very inexpensive to modify for increased speed and power as ports can easily have much less flow restriction than poppet valves.", "The answer very easy. Emissions.", "I should end it right there because that’s the big one and being on my phone and limited time I’m going to leave things out and I’m going to make blanket statements that need more explanation but no time to do so.", "Many people don’t realize that a huge reason for DOHC engines is for cleaner emissions and a distant second place is for power. With this setup you can alter valve timing, cam phase, overlap (which can’t be done with a SOHC) advance and retard overall timing to the point EGR is not always needed or needed less. It’s also nice to have a smooth idle which also brings hydrocarbons way down while still pulling strong to high rpm. While I love an old car with big cam and lopey idle to move the power up in the rpm range, idle has to suffer and vice versa. Catalysts don’t last but days on a big cam car and I use them to pass emissions for an hour and off it comes.", "But enough about cam/valve timing, a 2-stroke is extremely hard if not impossible to bring into the strict emissions compliance to be legal in the US and most of the world. There’s no fine tuning of intake and exhaust “valve “ timing based on rpm and load , there’s really no adjustable timing at all except for some crude and unpopular designs.", "Even if you could control the intake and exhaust events by rpm and load, a 2-stroke is dirty by nature. The most obvious is oil in the fuel. While the ratios can be very high, with little oil needing to be mixed in, this goes against it. A converter will clean it up but life will be decreased. Some don’t need oil in the fuel.", "As bad as oil burning, combustion is incomplete a lot of the time, causing hydrocarbons to go off the chart. When they’re “bubbling” and not “clean”, no converter will have a chance of reducing the hydrocarbons to acceptable levels. It’s a mix of “EGR” sort of , diluting the intake charge. When they’re clean and more efficient, in their powerband NOx is off the charts.", "Fuel economy is another huge problem. If you took a 4stroke and a 2-stroke with the same power level and ran them at full throttle, fuel usage is close. For part throttle operation which is 95%, the 4-stroke gets much better mpg. Before anyone says anything, there are “narrow rpm” 2-strokes out there in marine applications that can be tuned to be very efficient with a near constant engine speed. That obviously doesn’t work well in a car. That’s what all of the variable valve timing tech and variable intake runner length and other technologies are for in our daily driven 4 strokes, to make them more efficient at every rpm and load, both mpg and power.", "There are other reasons but I think I covered the main ones. Power delivery/torque gets honorable mention. The 2-stroke has a narrower powerband and makes less torque for its power output, resulting in needing more rpm to make its power, it’s hard to justify it in a regular automobile. You would need a way to keep rpms considerably higher than a comparable 4-stroke. I’m a manual, maybe a much shorter 1st gear so you don’t need to skip the clutch excessively and more closely spaced gears. With an auto, a higher stall converter will further kill mpg. I have a turbo car with a 5,800rpm stall and just to keep up with traffic when taking off from a light, with 1/10th throttle, rpms hover around 3,200 and with just a slight touch of the throttle you’re at 4K just to easily pass someone. It’s lots of fun but after owning it for years it’s just not practical for a daily and it gets 8mpg in the city if I behave myself and that’s for a V6 that only sees boost rarely. For comparison my other one is built similarly but has a smaller but much more modern and responsive turbo, only requiring a 2,800rpm stall and it gets 13–16 city. Obviously highway isn’t a problem with every car having a lockup converter (most logic locks them constantly in the city when appropriate) but even the final drive would have to be lower, I can imagine lugging a 2-stroke down the freeway at 1,500rpm at 70mph. Honestly a current 2-stroke would need to spin fewer rpm per mile covered to begin getting ok mpg. I’m thinking of power strokes per mile even if cylinder pressures were the same.", "I had high hopes direct gasoline injection might help bring the 2-stroke back for consideration, along with exotic valving technologies but it doesn’t seem so. It is a match made in heaven for 4 stroke turbocharging, enabling much higher boost on a given octane without preignition and with the newest batch of turbos, enabling a tiny 2.0 4 cylinder to make 250lbs of torque at 1,500rpm and 260hp, pulling strong to 7,000rpm. 260hp from a turbo 2.0 has been exceeded decades ago but they were laggy, usually needed more octane than pump gas would allow, and from what I saw on the streets and the track, not too reliable.", "My point above is that with DI and turbocharging you get a small engine that makes the power of a larger engine and drives just like a larger engined car while hauling around a 3,900lb 5 series which demands a lot more than a 2,000lb gutted Civic. No lag and good power right off of idle, more torque made at a lower rpm, giving more power at a lower rpm, usually, exceeding its larger NA alternative in off idle power and peak power. Better mpg and no hit to emissions with a fatter powerband than just about any NA engine. Sort of the nail in the coffin for 2-strokes even if they overcame the emissions hurdles, with the mentioned advantages, and now specific output and size and weight becoming more similar (not the same yet) with the turbo DI 4-strokes. In theory the 2-stroke seems the better choice with twice as many power strokes at a given rpm but so far we don’t have the technology to make them practical in cars. Maybe an old Detroit supercharged/turbocharged 2-stroke diesel scaled down and drastically moddedwould be the basic model to start from. Probably not.", "Think about a normal four-stroke engine. The piston moves down to suck in air and fuel, then the fuel pushes up to compress, then the spark plug fires and the burning gas forces the piston down. Then the piston moves back up to push up the exhaust. The six-stroke engine adds two more strokes after the exhaust stroke. Water is injected, and as it turns into steam, it pushes the piston down. Then the piston comes back up to force out the steam. It's really simple.\nA six-stroke engine combines an internal combustion engine with a steam engine to turn some of the waste heat into power. The only catch is that you have to add a water tank to your car that's about the same size as the gas tank. The good news is that you can probably eliminate the radiator.

There are two places to put this ring so oil doen’t leak out the exhaust ports. The first is to place the oil control ring at the bottom of the piston. This is not the best spot because the body of piston only gets a very thin film of oil to slide on. The second and much better solution is to insert the ring into a groove in the cylinder wall just below the exhaust ports. Achates does with their two-stroke diesel and reports very low oil consumption using this approach.", "The durability issue seems to result from the poor the oil mist lubrication and from the extra heat from one combustion event per revolution as compared with a four stroke.

It is interesting that two-stroke ship diesels use full crankcase lubrication and oil-cooled pistons and are very reliable.", "I need to be specific about what aspect of thermal efficiency is problematic with two-stroke engines. The exhaust ports open before the piston reaches bottom dead centre, In many two strokes the port opens as much as 2/3 way down the stroke. At this point, the cylinder still has considerable pressure. This wastes energy and produces that familiar harsh exhaust note you hear from two-strokes. An answer is to use a much longer stroke to bore ratio, to allow fuller expansion before the exhaust port opens.

Endovascular treatments can involve surgically removing a clot that caused a stroke, or fixing an aneurysm—which is a swollen blood vessel that bursts and causes pressure in the brain. Endovascular treatments for ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke, must be administered within 24 hours of symptom onset, and earlier treatment improves outcome so time is critically important.", "“If a witness sees someone having a stroke, it would be helpful if they look at what time the symptoms started,” she says. “That way, the emergency staff can make a more informed decision about treatment options.”", "3.

It will probably require more mixing, but once dissolved, you won’t have multiple phases forming.", "It’s probably not ideal to mix used motor oil into your fuel, even if you filter it first. Used oil contains heavy metals from the bearings, and those will end up in the two-stroke’s exhaust. It’s not good to breathe that stuff in.", "As a final note, I’d like to mention that two-stroke engines have been around for a ages, way before these fancy, overpriced two-stroke oils came around. People have used motor oil for this purpose for a long time, so I think it’s just fine."]}
