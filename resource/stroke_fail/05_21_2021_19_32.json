{"question": "What causes a 2-stroke engine to seize?", "answers": ["Lack of lubrication, 2 strokes require oil mixed with the fuel to lubricate the crankshaft and the piston cylinder. Because they don't have a oil pump or reservoir the crankshaft uses roller bearings to support the crankshaft and the connecting rods. I always run 40 to 1 ratio because most 2 strokes require 50 to 1 but some older 2 stroke engines run 30 to 1 ,however l have never had a lubricant issue running the 40 to 1 in a older 2 stroke that states 30 to 1 ratio. 2 stroke engines are not a high mileage engine. Most of them need to be rebuilt after just a couple years of use. Problem is they usually only get rebuilt after a failure. Oil injection is common today, but l usually put some oil in the fuel of the tank as well as the oil injection system because l ride snowmobiles and when they are really cold the injection oil are thick and have difficulty mixing with the gasoline when entering the engine. But how you treat them is important 1/2 throttle maximum until you are sure it is at operating temperature.

{"question": "What is the best diet to prevent a stroke?

{"question": "If the red and and the follow coin gets pocketed in the first stroke of the game? Should we have to pocket another follow coin?", "answers": ["Lack of lubrication, 2 strokes require oil mixed with the fuel to lubricate the crankshaft and the piston cylinder. Because they don't have a oil pump or reservoir the crankshaft uses roller bearings to support the crankshaft and the connecting rods. I always run 40 to 1 ratio because most 2 strokes require 50 to 1 but some older 2 stroke engines run 30 to 1 ,however l have never had a lubricant issue running the 40 to 1 in a older 2 stroke that states 30 to 1 ratio. 2 stroke engines are not a high mileage engine. Most of them need to be rebuilt after just a couple years of use. Problem is they usually only get rebuilt after a failure. Oil injection is common today, but l usually put some oil in the fuel of the tank as well as the oil injection system because l ride snowmobiles and when they are really cold the injection oil are thick and have difficulty mixing with the gasoline when entering the engine. But how you treat them is important 1/2 throttle maximum until you are sure it is at operating temperature. Liquids need more warm up time. 2 strokes fire on every other stroke so they experience more internal generated heat being produced. So every thing like clearances must be perfect or they will fail. Do not expect to get high mileage from a 2 stroke unless it's rpms and well controlled and they have more than adequate coolant.
