Ischemic stroke is a blocked artery that will be treated by a clot busting drug with good effect and positive outcomes. Hemorrhagic stroke is a burst artery causing issues because the blood is leaking out before reaching the affected tissue. Clot busting drugs prevent this bleed sealing itself, leading to the patient bleeding out, which is, needless to say, a particularly negative outcome.", "The problem is that in the field, they are indistinguishable based on signs and symptoms. A CT scan is required to determine the cause of the stroke. So paramedics are somewhat loathe to go pumping clot busting drugs into stroke patients in the field, because for all intents and purposes you've got a 50:50 call on either fixing the problem or killing the patient, without even factoring in the other potential complications.

Diffusion weighting is about actually imaging how \"free\" water molecules are in a certain region of tissue (and it depends on how much water there is as well). You can think of it as looking at tissue microstructure by evaluating how tissue water is behaving. When tissue dies and you have an ischemic infarct, diffusion goes way down. However, there are still areas surrounding the infarcted region that are viable but aren't getting sufficient blood perfusion. perfusion weighting helps show those regions, as it actually looks at how much fresh blood supply is entering into a region. Quickly re-perfusing those regions that are still viable but are inadequately perfused is critical to saving that tissue and preventing the lesion of infarcted tissue from growing, which increases chances for functional recovery.

Ang2 plays a critical role in hypoxia-induced lung injury and inflammation. Ang2 blockage inhibited expression of EC adhesion molecules, can improve blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity.", "Elevated serum ferritin levels in severe or critically ill patients is definitely an interesting biomarker as this could explain regulated cell death via a process called ferroptosis.

As the iron chelator, Deferoxamine (DFX), reduces brain swelling induced by hemoglobin, iron appears to be an important factor in hemoglobin-induced injury. Cellular edema may contribute to brain swelling, but the main form of edema formation after Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is vasogenic brain edema. Studies have shown that hemoglobin can cause death of endothelial cells and a significant disruption of the BBB. This explains why Glucocorticoids, particularly, Dexamethasone (Dex) works well in severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients, coordinately regulating, an increase in angiopoietin-1 and decrease in VEGF thereby stabilizing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to an attenuation of vasogenic brain edema. Angiopoietin-1 protects neurons by inhibiting autophagy after neuronal oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery injury from apoptosis.", "In one recent study, Dex attenuated the elevated nitric oxide production and decreased the inducible isoform nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) mRNA expression by kainate treatment, possibly acting as a free radical scavenger.", "After ischemic stroke, cytotoxic edema is first observed within a few hours and then declines within 1 day.

Ischemic stroke is a blocked artery that will be treated by a clot busting drug with good effect and positive outcomes. Hemorrhagic stroke is a burst artery causing issues because the blood is leaking out before reaching the affected tissue. Clot busting drugs prevent this bleed sealing itself, leading to the patient bleeding out, which is, needless to say, a particularly negative outcome.", "The problem is that in the field, they are indistinguishable based on signs and symptoms. A CT scan is required to determine the cause of the stroke. So paramedics are somewhat loathe to go pumping clot busting drugs into stroke patients in the field, because for all intents and purposes you've got a 50:50 call on either fixing the problem or killing the patient, without even factoring in the other potential complications. So unless they are working on a dedicated stroke ambulance with a portable CT in the back, they are almost certainly not carrying clot busters for strokes."]}

Diffusion weighting is about actually imaging how \"free\" water molecules are in a certain region of tissue (and it depends on how much water there is as well). You can think of it as looking at tissue microstructure by evaluating how tissue water is behaving. When tissue dies and you have an ischemic infarct, diffusion goes way down. However, there are still areas surrounding the infarcted region that are viable but aren't getting sufficient blood perfusion. perfusion weighting helps show those regions, as it actually looks at how much fresh blood supply is entering into a region. Quickly re-perfusing those regions that are still viable but are inadequately perfused is critical to saving that tissue and preventing the lesion of infarcted tissue from growing, which increases chances for functional recovery.

Quickly re-perfusing those regions that are still viable but are inadequately perfused is critical to saving that tissue and preventing the lesion of infarcted tissue from growing, which increases chances for functional recovery. It's a very short time window to really help the stroke patient in this way at this acute phase ...", "See: http://radiology-medical-imaging-technology.blogspot.com/2012/12/perfusion-imaging-of-infarct-and.html", "Here's a brief comparison between information you glean from DWI and information you glean from PWI in ischemic stroke:", "(from Part II: Modalities, input, and image processing see\nstroke\ndifferently\n)", "Well, there are two timeframes for treatment: the acute phase (while you’re in the hospital) and afterwards.", "The immediate treatment is TPA, if you’re eligible for it; that breaks up the clot.

If you’re depressed, she will most certainly put you on anti-depressants. In my case, this was a godsend; I eventually tried Wellbutrin, which woke me up when nothing else would. Hooray!", "*How’s your energy? In my case, it was terrible. I felt like one of those mosquitos that got stuck in amber and eventually suffocated. My physiatrist tried a whole bunch of stuff — Ritalin, Adderall, modanifil, Aricept — most of which either didn’t work, make me suicidally depressed (that was modanifil), or made me feel “weird”.

The cerebellum which is the balance center of the brain also communic extensively with the pons.", "The pons is supplied by an important main artery called the basilar artery and it's branches called the perforators.", "An overwhelming majority of ischemic strokes to the pons entail blockage of these perforators and produce a variety of symptoms depending on the area that is damaged. Usually there is weakness of one side of the face causing a facial droop, weakness of one side of the body (paralysis) imbalance and difficulty swallowing.

Angiopoietins could be playing a significant role in blood and lymphatic endothelial cells (EC), in particular, Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) expression is triggered by inflammatory mediators, such as thrombin, and conditions, such as hypoxia and cancer. Angiopoietin also plays a role in smooth muscle cells, and microvascular thrombosis.", "While the role of Ang2 in regulating angiogenesis and vascular integrity has been well recognized, elevated serum angiopoietin-2 and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been implicated as biomarkers in the role in inflammation, in particular, Ang2 expression is increased dramatically at the sites of endothelial activation and is induced by various cytokines. Ang2 plays a critical role in hypoxia-induced lung injury and inflammation. Ang2 blockage inhibited expression of EC adhesion molecules, can improve blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity.", "Elevated serum ferritin levels in severe or critically ill patients is definitely an interesting biomarker as this could explain regulated cell death via a process called ferroptosis.

Alterations in oxygenation are common, reducing cell viability including by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and oxidative stress, leading to irreversible oxidation and damage of proteins, DNA and lipids, release of cyctochrome c and activation of apoptotic pathways.", "Further analysis also show that many targets of autophagy modulators are involved in apoptosis (e.g. p53, Bcl-2, and caspase 8), necroptosis (e.g. caspase 8, RIPK1, and TNF), and ferroptosis (e.g. p53, 15LOX, and ACSL4) pathways.", "Brain swelling in the cortex/hippocampal region is also found to contain higher iron levels. As the iron chelator, Deferoxamine (DFX), reduces brain swelling induced by hemoglobin, iron appears to be an important factor in hemoglobin-induced injury. Cellular edema may contribute to brain swelling, but the main form of edema formation after Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is vasogenic brain edema. Studies have shown that hemoglobin can cause death of endothelial cells and a significant disruption of the BBB. This explains why Glucocorticoids, particularly, Dexamethasone (Dex) works well in severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients, coordinately regulating, an increase in angiopoietin-1 and decrease in VEGF thereby stabilizing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to an attenuation of vasogenic brain edema. Angiopoietin-1 protects neurons by inhibiting autophagy after neuronal oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery injury from apoptosis.", "In one recent study, Dex attenuated the elevated nitric oxide production and decreased the inducible isoform nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) mRNA expression by kainate treatment, possibly acting as a free radical scavenger.", "After ischemic stroke, cytotoxic edema is first observed within a few hours and then declines within 1 day. Conversely, vasogenic edema forms within two to three days and is maintained for several days, after ICH.", "Since the oxygen-glucose supply for brain cells is remarkably diminished by deterioration of the blood brain flow after cerebral ischemia, which causes a drop in intracellular ATP production, and pH, switching to anaerobic glycolysis with lactic acid production.

Your odds of surviving it are much better! The first one is a clot and the other is a bleed. So, the treat it first by locating it preferably as soon as they are aware of its existance. Clots can be a little dangerous. You don’t want it floating off into some place dangerous and getting stuck, causing damage. If they determine that this clot is one they can safely break down without causing you harm, they give you medicine to do so. If not, they will sometimes remove it surgically. The biggest danger is when the clot lodges in the heart, lungs or brain. Things can get scary then. Some hospitals have whole wings for dealing with that! They also often have two nurses per bed for the people with those issues and the ones with the hemorrhagics. They get even scarier. But, you have enough to deal with I bet.

Its onset is usually rapid and it may last for more than 24 hours. Patient may or may not survive during this episode. It presents as weakness of any area of body with or without disturbance of speech. It usually occurs after the age of 40 years. It is more common in males as compared to females. Its risk factors are non- modifiable which include age, gender, hereditary and previous history of stroke. Others are modifiable and include hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes, high blood cholesterol level and heart failure. Stroke is divided into two groups. One is hemorrhagic and other is ischemic stroke.", "It occurs due to rupture of an artery. It has two types. One is intra-cerebral hemorrhage which occurs due to rupture of small arteries which are already weakened by hypertension. It can be fatal as compression of brain can occur. Second type is sub-arachnoid hemorrhage which develops due to rupture of major artery at the level of brain. This type of hemorrhage is characterized by sudden onset of headache, difficulty in movements of eyes, nausea and vomiting. History of patient who presents with stroke is important to determine the cause and progression of this disease.", "Ischemic stroke occurs due to blockage of a major artery ultimately leading to decreased blood flow to the brain resulting in damage to brain cells which is called ‘cerebral infarction’. Arteries may be occluded due to thrombosis in intracranial or extra-cranial arteries or embolism from somewhere outside the brain especially heart. Once deprived of blood supply, brain tissues undergo sudden death within a few minutes.

There is a blockage in the middle cerebral artery which supplies blood to much of the cerebrum. The large dark swelling on the right side of the CT scan (the left side of the patient’s brain) is dead brain tissue. Irreversibly so. These dead cells swell and leak fluid.

This minimizes damage to healthy brain. The decision to do this surgery is quite challenging - as you can imagine the patient has already suffered a devastating stroke, and outcomes from someone requiring this surgery are usually quite poor, particularly if they are older and have other medical problems.", "An ischemic strokes fells you. And recurrent ischemic strokes, you are not up and walking. You are paralyzed and may lose your ability to speak at all.

I don’t know if reporting mini-strokes is required.", "Not knowing the full scope of practice for every service in the world, I can't definitively say yes or no, but I would say it is highly unlikely except in specialist cases.", "The reason for this is that there are 2 causes of stroke. Ischemic stroke is a blocked artery that will be treated by a clot busting drug with good effect and positive outcomes. Hemorrhagic stroke is a burst artery causing issues because the blood is leaking out before reaching the affected tissue. Clot busting drugs prevent this bleed sealing itself, leading to the patient bleeding out, which is, needless to say, a particularly negative outcome.", "The problem is that in the field, they are indistinguishable based on signs and symptoms. A CT scan is required to determine the cause of the stroke. So paramedics are somewhat loathe to go pumping clot busting drugs into stroke patients in the field, because for all intents and purposes you've got a 50:50 call on either fixing the problem or killing the patient, without even factoring in the other potential complications. So unless they are working on a dedicated stroke ambulance with a portable CT in the back, they are almost certainly not carrying clot busters for strokes."]}
